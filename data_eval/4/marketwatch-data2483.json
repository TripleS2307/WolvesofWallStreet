The chief executives of nine drug companies that are working on vaccines \u00e2\u0080\u0094 AstraZeneca PLC AZN, +1.16% AZN, +0.63%, BioNtech SE B, +0.33%, GlaxoSmithKline PLC GSK, +1.10% \u00c2 GSK, +1.52%, Moderna Inc. MRNA, +0.09%, Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +1.39%, Merck & Co. Inc. MRK, -0.14%, Novavax Inc. NVAX, +0.18% \u00c2 and Sanofi SA SAN, +1.20% \u00c2 SNY, +0.89% \u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 signed a pledge to follow the path toward approval required by a regulator like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that involves Phase 3 clinical trials. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe believe this pledge will help ensure public confidence in the rigorous scientific and regulatory process by which COVID-19 vaccines are evaluated and may ultimately be approved,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the CEOs wrote. The move comes amid intensifying fears that the administration of President Donald Trump will attempt to rush out a vaccine before the Nov. 3 election. That comes after the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sent a letter to state governors in late August, urging them to have vaccine distribution centers ready by Nov. 1, just two days before the presidential election, and with Trump saying on Monday that a vaccine could arrive by a \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery special date.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Besides the logistical challenge of preparing centers at such short notice, experts fear that with clinical trials still recruiting participants, there will not be enough data by November to determine the efficacy or safety of a vaccine, and that a presidential pre-election push will imperil recruitment. Trump has at times appeared to tie his re-election chances to the arrival of a vaccine before the election and has accused the FDA of moving slowly to lengthen his odds against Democrat Joe Biden. The CEOs titled the statement announcing their pledge: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBiopharma Leaders Unite to Stand with Science.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The companies said they would \u00e2\u0080\u009conly submit for approval or emergency use authorization after demonstrating safety and efficacy through a Phase 3 clinical study that is designed and conducted to meet requirements of expert regulatory authorities such as FDA.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Moncef Slaoui, a venture-capital investor and former GlaxoSmithKline PLC executive who heads up the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cOperation Warp Speed\u00e2\u0080\u009d program, told NPR last week that he cannot imagine trials producing data by the end of October. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a very, very low chance that the trials that are running as we speak could read before the end of October, and therefore, there could be \u00e2\u0080\u0094 if all other conditions required for an [EUA] are met \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an approval,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s extremely unlikely but not impossible.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Opinion: Trump is following the playbook of other foes of democracy \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how to stop him Read also:Kamala Harris warns voter suppression, foreign interference could affect election Separately, Slaoui told Science that he would resign if he felt \u00e2\u0080\u009cundue\u00e2\u0080\u009d political pressure in the vaccine race. In other news: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Infectious-disease experts are concerned that the cold weather will lead to a surge in new coronavirus cases once winter begins, the Washington Post reported. Respiratory viruses typically start spreading a few weeks after schools reopen after the summer break, while the Labor Day holiday is expected to cause a spike in infections among people who gathered in large numbers. A model produced by the University of Washington\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation that was published on Friday is forecasting that 410,000 Americans will have died by year-end under its \u00e2\u0080\u009cmost-likely scenario,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the paper reported. That would be more than double the current death toll of 189,226, the biggest in the world.

India now has more than 4.28 million confirmed coronavirus cases, and 72,775 people have died, the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s third biggest death toll, according to numbers aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. Lockdowns have been reimposed in the northern state of Punjab, but the measures are pushing people into poverty and adding to a long-running tragedy, that of farmer suicides, the New York Times reported. In 2019, 10,281 Indian farmers took their own lives, the paper reported, citing the National Crime Records Bureau. The number is expected to be understated as suicide is a crime in India. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 South Africa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gross domestic product fell a staggering 51% in the second quarter from the first, as the pandemic forced the country into a strict lockdown, Reuters reported.

The Johns Hopkins data show China has 90,085 cases and 4,733 deaths. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 The prime minister of France, Jean Castex, will be tested for the virus, after he spent part of the weekend with the head of the Tour de France cycling race, Christian Prudhomme, who has tested positive for the virus, Agence France-Presse reported. Castex was in Prudhomme\u00e2\u0080\u0099s car as they followed the eighth stage of the race on Saturday. Prudhomme, who is asymptomatic, is leaving the race for a week and will quarantine. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe prime minister will again undergo a test,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Castex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office said, adding that both men had worn masks and respected rules on social distancing. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 The 10-day Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in South Dakota in August, which drew more than 400,000 people, has now been linked to more than 250,000 coronavirus cases, according to a study from Germany\u00e2\u0080\u0099s IZA Institute of Labor Economics. Using cellphone data from the rally, researchers found the bikers, who were photographed and filmed in crowded bars, restaurants and outdoor venues mostly without face masks, allowed for many of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cworst case scenarios\u00e2\u0080\u009d for superspreading.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The event \u00e2\u0080\u009cwas prolonged, included individuals packed closely together, involved a large out-of-town population, and had low compliance with recommended infection countermeasures such as the use of masks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the researchers wrote. The event will cost an estimated $12 billion in health care costs, they wrote. Last week, the Washington Post reported the first COVID-19 death from the event, a Minnesota biker in his 60s. Latest tallies There are now 893,382 fatalities around the world from COVID-19, the Johns Hopkins data show. At least 18.4 million people have tested positive and recovered. Brazil has the third-highest case tally at 4.1 million and second-highest death toll at 126,960. Mexico has fourth-highest death toll after India at 67,781 deaths and 637,509 cases.

Thermo has been tasked with manufacturing drug substance and doing fill-and-finish work for the vaccine. Inovio has released limited data from its Phase 1 clinical trial, with plans to publish the full data in a peer-reviewed medical journal, and said it expects to start its Phase 2/3 trial this month, once it gets the go-ahead from the Food and Drug Administration.
