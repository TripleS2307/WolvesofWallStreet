As part of his care regimen so far, Trump has been treated with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.\u2019 REGN, +0.36% still-investigational antibody treatment, Gilead Sciences Inc.\u2019s GILD, +0.82% remdesivir, supplemental oxygen at least once, and now dexamethasone, in that order, according to Dr. Sean Conley, Trump\u2019s physician. Trump\u2019s team of doctors were hopeful that he could return to the White House as early as Monday. During a news conference on Sunday morning, Conley confirmed for the first time that the president had received oxygen support, at least once, and that he had been started on dexamethasone on Saturday. Trump\u2019s oxygen saturation levels have fallen twice below 95%, which is considered the low-side of a normal reading. \u201cIn response to transient low oxygen levels\u2026we did initiate dexamethasone therapy,\u201d Dr. Brian Garibaldi, director of the biocontainment unit at Johns Hopkins Medicine and one of the physicians on Trumps\u2019s care team at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, said during the news conference on Sunday. \u201cOur plan is to continue that for the time being.\u201d Since Trump tweeted Friday that he and First Lady Melania Trump had tested positive for the coronavirus, there has been conflicting information released from White House officials about the president\u2019s health, including the date of his last negative COVID-19 and when he began treatment. Conley had initially said Saturday morning that Trump was diagnosed 72 hours ago, which would be Wednesday morning \u2014 about 36 hours before he disclosed his diagnosis, and that he had received the Regeneron experimental therapy 48 hours ago, which would be Thursday morning. A statement issued Saturday evening by the White House said Conley misspoke, and Trump had been diagnosed Thursday night and received the first infusion of the Regeneron drug on Friday. Trump is also taking zinc, vitamin D, an acid reducer, melatonin and aspirin, according to Conley, who noted Saturday that Trump is on a five-day regimen of remdesivir. Trump\u2019s diagnosis highlights one of the still challenging clinical elements of the COVID-19 pandemic, that there are few treatment options available for patients with COVID-19. For people with severe forms of the disease, treatment can include convalescent plasma, the steroid dexamethasone, and/or remdesivir. Most of the available treatments for COVID-19 infections target severely ill patients who have been hospitalized. This includes remdesivir and convalescent plasma, which is gathered from people who have recovered from COVID-19 infections \u2014 both therapies have received emergency use authorization during the pandemic. Dexamethasone is another option for hospitalized patients who are in need of oxygen support. The steroid, which is approved by the FDA for other indications, demonstrated in clinical trials in the U.K. that it can reduce mortality in some severely ill COVID-19 patients. \u201cDexamethasone is a cheap, widely available, definitively effective therapy for patients on oxygen support in the hospital,\u201d Raymond James analyst Steven Seedhouse told investors in June. \u201cTo be clear, it has no apparent benefit in patients not on oxygen or not hospitalized.\u201d For people with mild to moderate forms of the disease, there are no FDA-authorized or approved drugs, though two drug makers including Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, +2.20% and Regeneron recently shared promising results for a pair of still-investigational antibody-based treatments. Neither drug has been authorized or approved by the FDA at this time. \u201cThere really aren\u2019t a lot of very effective therapies we have at this stage of the disease,\u201d said Dr. Steven Shapiro, chief medical and scientific officer at UPMC, a hospital system based in Pittsburgh, who is not involved in Trump\u2019s treatment. \u201cThe thing that we know that is most effective right now are steroids. But that tends to work later in the disease when someone develops the pneumonia.\u201d Regeneron\u2019s REGN-COV2 and Lilly\u2019s LY-CoV555 are both being tested in clinical trials, for people with mild to moderate forms of the disease. Like convalescent-plasma treatments, these drugs also rely on antibodies, and both have shown so far that they help reduce viral load, based on interim data shared in the past month. Raymond James analysts predicted Friday morning that one of these investigational drugs would be prescribed to Trump. That said, physicians have the discretion to prescribe medications that are not approved or authorized by the FDA for a specific use. This is called off-label prescribing, and it\u2019s common in the U.S. health care system. (One 2006 study estimates that one-fifth of U.S. prescriptions are off-label.) Trump in May disclosed that he was taking the antimalarial hydroxychloroquine that he spent months promoting as a potential COVID-19 treatment. At that time it was being tested in clinical trials as both a treatment and to see if it could prevent infections in people who had been exposed to the virus. The FDA had granted the drug an emergency use authorization in March but revoked that authorization in June. Health-care providers around the world have tested the efficacy of zinc, vitamin C, vitamin D and the antibiotic azithromycin to COVID-19 patients; however, none of those treatments has so far shown a clinical benefit, according to Shapiro. \u201cIt\u2019s watching, waiting \u2026 just supportive care, in general. Isolate,\u201d he said. \u201cMasks are really important. That is our vaccine right now. It\u2019s really good at preventing the spread. And if not entirely, it certainly will lower the dosage and make the disease less severe. So that\u2019s one lesson I think that everyone should learn from this.\u201d"}]}
