But banks - large and small - have downplayed the importance of changing the rules.\u201cThe sector\u2019s success in this task is a matter of national urgency, and in my view, congressional action to improve regulatory flexibility to respond would only help achieve it,\u201d Fed Vice Chairman of Supervision Randal Quarles wrote in an April 22 letter to the Senate Banking Committee\u2019s chairman and top Republican, Mike Crapo.Chairman, US Senator Mike Crapo, (R-ID), speaks during a Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee nominations hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC on May 5, 2020.

A higher leverage ratio suggests that a given bank is better positioned to sustain potential losses than another bank with a comparably lower leverage ratio.Crapo, with nudging from the Fed vice chairman, is now floating legislative text that would empower the Fed to skirt a Dodd-Frank component known as the \u201cCollins Amendment\u201d to temporarily ease its regulatory approach to minimum ratios.But banks of all sizes have insisted that they have plenty of capital to lend without the regulatory help, raising questions over whether or not loosening key regulations will have the desired impact of spurring lending.Leverage RatioAn experiment on the effect of loosening the leverage ratio is already playing out at the country\u2019s four largest banks - JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC).All four banks face an additional, more stringent leverage requirement called the \u201csupplementary leverage ratio.\u201d Responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Fed in April eased its calculation of the SLR through March 31 next year to \u201cincrease banking organizations' ability to provide credit to households and businesses.\u201dStory continuesThe SLR is calculated as Tier 1 capital (a standardized definition of bank capital) divided by total leverage exposure, which accounts for a bank\u2019s total balance sheet in addition to any hidden \u201coff-balance sheet\u201d exposures like derivatives and repurchase agreements.The Fed allowed the largest banks to simply not count U.S. Treasuries or deposits at the Federal Reserve towards leverage exposure, boosting the SLRs at all four banks.By reducing the calculation of the total leverage exposure (the denominator of the SLR), all four big banks were able to increase their SLRs in the second quarter. (Credit: David Foster / Yahoo Finance)Quarles has said the change is designed to accommodate the flood of U.S. Treasuries and bank reserves that the private sector has had to absorb as the Fed ballooned its balance sheet to $7 trillion.\u201cIf adjustments aren't made to those capital constraints, then the influx of those safe assets will ultimately cause them to have to turn away customers,\u201d Quarles told Congress May 12.The country\u2019s largest bank, JPMorgan Chase, says it will not use temporary buffers, insisting that the bank has enough capital without the relief.\u201cTemporary is a funny thing when you go into a crisis,\u201d JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told investors July 14. \u201cI mean you could use it for a while, but it disappears...so my view is we shouldn't rely on anything like that.\u201dLending?Small banks face a \u201ccommunity bank leverage ratio\u201d that cannot be adjusted as the SLR was, due to the statutory limitation in the Collins Amendment.But even without further regulatory relief, small banks have outpaced their larger peers in extending credit. Based on Federal Reserve data, year-over-year growth in loan portfolios at the largest 25 banks peaked at about 9% in April but have since come back down.For comparison, small banks (the universe of banks outside the top 25) have supported loan portfolios 13-14% larger than those same portfolios were last year.Small banks grew their loan portfolios more than the largest banks did. Small banks (those not in the top 25) are a major provider of credit; as of June, 38% of the $10.6 trillion in U.S. loans and leases sit on the balance sheets of these small banks based on Federal Reserve data. (Credit: David Foster / Yahoo Finance)\u201cI don\u2019t get the sense that many or any banks aren\u2019t lending now because of a lack of capital,\u201d said Patrick Ryan, the CEO of First Bank, a New Jersey-based community bank with $2.3 billion in total assets. \u201cTo the extent that folks aren\u2019t lending, it\u2019s more risk aversion than lack of capital.\u201dBanks across the board are pulling back. A recent Federal Reserve survey of loan officers detailed tighter underwriting standards across all types of commercial and household loans during the second quarter. But the problem is also a lack of interest in borrowing; families have paid down debt and businesses are weary of taking out more loans with so much uncertainty about the future.At superregional bank M&T, CFO Darren King told analysts on July 23 that \u201cwe've definitely seen a slowdown in demand.\u201dFor now, the banks have messaged that they are confident they will be able to meet credit needs - with or without the legislative change.That approach could save them from the political drama unfolding in DC. As originally reported by The New York Times, Republican Senator Susan Collins - the author of the Collins Amendment - has proposed striking the Crapo bill\u2019s language that would allow the Fed to temporarily ease the leverage ratio.A Democratic-led House also threatens the Crapo proposal\u2019s path into the final coronavirus relief package, which still remains up in the air.The bank lobby, though, is still actively rooting for the legislation. The Bank Policy Institute, representing the nation\u2019s largest banks, told Yahoo Finance in a statement that it \u201ccould bolster banks\u2019 ability to support lending and the economic recovery.\u201d The Independent Bankers of America, representing community banks, says the regulatory room for lending may be needed later.\u201cFor a lot of small businesses, the need for credit will probably be even greater for next year than what we\u2019re facing right now,\u201d said ICBA executive vice president of government relations Paul Merski.Brian Cheung is a reporter covering the Fed, economics, and banking for Yahoo Finance.
