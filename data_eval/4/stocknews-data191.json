(TSLA) will hold its annual shareholders\u2019 meeting in conjunction with a \u201cbattery technology day\u201d where it is expected to reveal details about its latest innovations in batteries. TSLA has been developing battery cells for over a year, and now the company plans to produce them on its own. Moreover, on September 11, Musk tweeted that \u201cmany exciting things will be unveiled\u201d at the Battery Day event. The stock is already up 428.5% year-to-date and Wall Street cites the event as the \u201cnext catalyst\u201d for TSLA\u2019s skyrocketing share price. Batteries have become crucial for Electric Vehicle (EV) with rising competition in the space. Lithium-ion batteries power all EVs and have many different material compositions. TSLA\u2019s primary EV battery technology is NCA (based on nickel-cobalt-aluminum oxide chemistry). Musk is looking to secure the supply of these key ingredients. On TSLA\u2019s second-quarter earnings call, Musk pleaded, \u201cany mining companies out there, please mine more nickel.\u201d 9 \"BUY THE DIP\" Growth Stocks For 2020Hence, the increase in demand and price for battery components, primarily nickel and lithium, is a problem for TSLA, but it\u2019s an opportunity for companies like Rio Tinto Group (RIO), Albemarle Corporation (ALB), Sociedad Quimica y Minera S.A. (SQM) and Lithium Americas Corp. (LAC). So, these stocks could continue flying higher after Tesla\u2019s Battery Day. Rio Tinto Group (RIO) RIO engages in finding, mining, and processing mineral resources worldwide, with iron ore being the dominant commodity. The London-based company owns an integrated network of 16 mines in the Pilbara region of Western Australia and RIO extracts the bulk of its ore from this mine. RIO has recently signed a memorandum of understanding with Turquoise Hill Resources (TRQ) on a long-term funding plan for the Oyu Tolgoi copper mine in Mongolia. The company has also approved an investment close to $200 million for the next stage of development of the lithium-borate Jadar project in Serbia. Moreover, the healthy demand for iron from China should continue to propel the price of iron ore over the long term. RIO delivered a top-line of $9.68 billion for the second quarter ended June 2020, which was a 6.5% decline year-over-year. The gross margin for the quarter stood at 37%. The lockdown affected the global supply chain as both production and shipments declined along with a sharp drop in copper and aluminum prices. Nevertheless, the company managed to generate a free cash flow of $1.71 billion and declared an interim dividend of $1.55 for the quarter. EPS for the quarter came in $1.02, declining 18% year-over-year. However, the company had successfully operated its global mines throughout the pandemic for the production of diamonds. Rising commodity prices should get reflected in RIO\u2019s EPS in the coming quarters. RIO closed Friday\u2019s trading session at $64.42, gaining 16.7% year-to-date. The stock has grown more than 49% in the past six months. TSLA\u2019s battery day might help this stock draw significant investor attention. How does RIO stack up for the POWR Ratings?
