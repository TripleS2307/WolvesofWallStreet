While investors worried about valuations at their highest levels in more than a decade, remarks by President Donald Trump on Monday, threatening to \u201cdecouple\u201d the U.S. economy from China added to market jitters, analysts said.How did major indexes fare? The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% dropped 632.42 points, or 2.3%, to finish at 27,500.89, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% gave up 95.12 points, or 2.8%, to end at 3,331.84 The Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39% skid 465.44 points, or 4.1%, to close in correction territory at 10,847.69, after plunging 10% in the three sessions from its 12,056.44 record close on Sept. 2. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.3% last week to end Friday at 11,313.13, its biggest weekly decline since March. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.8% last week, ending at 28,133.31, while the S&P 500 dropped 2.3% to 3,426.96 \u2014 the biggest weekly falls for those indexes since June. To qualify for correction territory, shares must end at least 10% lower from their prior closing high, which the Nasdaq accomplished on Tuesday after only three trading sessions, its quickest correction on record, according to Dow Jones Market Data. What drove the market? High valuations especially for technology companies, a sluggish economic recovery in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, geopolitical risks including U.S. - China tensions, and the upcoming November elections all pose risks for investors, though the Nasdaq bore the brunt Tuesday, slumping 10% in three days, to register its fastest correction ever. Read:Tech-stock rout stirs memories of 1999-2000, but here\u2019s what\u2019s different The reversal for the Nasdaq, which had previously soared to a series of all-time highs, was led by falls for its highest-flying components, including Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.74%, Facebook Inc. FB, +0.26%, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +2.48% and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +3.01% and Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOG, +1.97% GOOGL, +1.82% as worries grew that the momentum-led gains for the sector had finally pushed valuations too far to be sustained. One thing to watch will be if major U.S. equity indexes can manage to rally without the tech giants, given their bulkier footprint in a stay-at-home, pandemic world, said Clifton Hill, a portfolio manager for Acadian Asset Management\u2019s multi-asset class strategies group, in an interview with MarketWatch. Hill also said he\u2019ll be watching to see whether money fleeing tech stocks rotates into \u201cvalue equities and others that had not done as well,\u201d while also monitoring developments on the \u201cNasdaq whale\u201d front, after the Financial Times unmasked SoftBank on Friday as having amassed billions worth of equity derivatives in recent months that helped fuel the sharp ascent for big tech stocks.

Remarks by Trump in a Labor Day news conference also left stocks under pressure, analysts said. \u201cWe will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we\u2019ll end reliance on China once and for all, whether it\u2019s decoupling or putting in massive tariffs like I\u2019ve been doing already. We\u2019re going to end our reliance on China, because we can\u2019t rely on China,\u201d Trump said. \u201cDecoupling implies that only domestic companies can serve domestic customers,\u201d Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, wrote in a note Tuesday. But his team also outlined several reasons why the post-COVID-19 world already was poised \u201cto be less global and more digital\u201d anyway, as production is brought closer to home and driven to adopt more technology and automation in the process. Meanwhile, China on Tuesday said it would launch an initiative of its own to set global standards on data security, a move seen as an attempt to counter U.S. efforts to isolate their networks from Chinese technology.
