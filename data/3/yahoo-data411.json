The net additions in payrolls topped consensus expectations, and far exceeded ADP\u2019s private payrolls data on Wednesday, which logged a gain of over 2.3 million jobs.Although new unemployment insurance claims were higher than expectations, investors shrugged off the report in favor of the boom of workers returning to the labor force. The S&P 500 rose about 0.5% on Thursday to cap off an advance of 4% since market close last Friday. The Dow rose 4.6%, while the Nasdaq rose 3.25% on the week.Wall Street ended July\u2019s first two trading days in the third quarter on a positive note, buoyed over the past two days both after Pfizer\u2019s (PFE) coronavirus vaccine candidate showing progress in a trial phase \u2014 and the Federal Reserve\u2019s pledge to keep the monetary spigots open \u201cfor years.\u201d News Thursday that Moderna\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine trial would be delayed past next week did little to knock the risk-on mood across markets.Still, record-breaking surges in coronavirus infections are overshadowing market psychology, and setting the tone for the start of the second half of a turbulent year.New York City on Wednesday joined New Jersey in postponing plans to reopen indoor dining, with cases outside the Tri-state area skyrocketing. Meanwhile, a spike in California\u2019s infections reportedly prompted the state to shutter indoor activities, including dining, to mitigate the spread.And investor expectations are intricately tied to new surges in COVID-19 infections, which are walloping the Sun Belt states and prompting more regions to rethink reopening plans. That may put a definitive cap on a market that\u2019s skyrocketed since plunging to multi-year lows in when lockdowns first began in March.Story continuesMarkets will be closed Friday in observance of the Fourth of July holiday.\u20144:04 p.m. ET: Stocks end the week higher after strong jobs reportHere were the main moves in markets, as of 4:04 p.m. ET:S&P 500 (^GSPC): +14.15 points (+0.45%) to 3,130.01Dow (^DJI): +92.39 points (+0.36%) to 25,827.36Nasdaq (^IXIC): +53 points (+0.52%) to 10,207.63Crude (CL=F): +$0.44 (+1.1%) to $40.26 a barrelGold (GC=F): +$8.30 (+0.47%) to $1,788.20 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): -1.3 bps to yield 0.669%\u20143:03 p.m. ET: Stocks pace toward weekly gains ahead of holidayThe three major indices were on track to rise for the holiday-shortened week, with an hour left to go in Thursday\u2019s session.
