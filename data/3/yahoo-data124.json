While our deliveries were lower compared to a year ago, our profitability rose meaningfully, led by a housing gross profit margin of 20.6%, excluding inventory-related charges, driving a 14% increase in our diluted earnings per share,\" said Jeffrey Mezger, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.\"Housing market conditions strengthened during the third quarter, fueled by the combination of historically low mortgage interest rates, a limited supply of resale inventory and consumers\u2019 desire to own a single-family home,\" continued Mezger. \"Reflecting this strength, our net orders expanded 27% year over year, with growth in each of our four regions. We achieved a monthly absorption pace that accelerated to 5.9 orders per community, an increase of 36%, while we also increased prices in most of our communities. We believe that our Built-to-Order model is a key factor driving our sales pace, with this quarter\u2019s results underscoring the robust demand for the choice and personalization we offer to our homebuyers.\"\"As we look ahead to 2021, assuming market conditions remain favorable, we believe we are well positioned to expand our scale, and, with a leaner and more efficient operation, we anticipate accelerating our profitable growth next year, as we remain focused on generating higher returns,\" concluded Mezger.Three Months Ended August 31, 2020 (comparisons on a year-over-year basis)Revenues totaled $999.0 million, down 14% from $1.16 billion, reflecting the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic during the Company\u2019s 2020 second quarter.Homes delivered were 2,545, compared to 3,022.Average selling price was $384,700, up from $381,400.Homebuilding operating income increased to $88.9 million from $85.5 million. The homebuilding operating income margin expanded 150 basis points to 8.9%. Excluding inventory-related charges of $6.9 million in the current quarter and $5.3 million in the year-earlier quarter, this metric improved 180 basis points to 9.6%.The housing gross profit margin expanded 140 basis points to 19.9%. Excluding inventory-related charges, the housing gross profit margin increased 170 basis points to 20.6%.The housing gross profit margin improvement primarily reflected a mix shift of homes delivered, lower amortization of previously capitalized interest, workforce realignment and reductions in the second quarter in response to the significant negative impact from the pandemic on the Company\u2019s business, and a favorable pricing environment during the period.Adjusted housing gross profit margin, a metric that excludes inventory-related charges and the amortization of previously capitalized interest, increased to 23.7% from 22.3%.Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of housing revenues improved slightly to 11.0%, mainly due to the Company\u2019s targeted actions, including the above-mentioned workforce reductions, to reduce overhead costs, partly offset by decreased operating leverage from lower housing revenues.The Company\u2019s financial services operations generated pretax income of $9.7 million, up from $6.6 million, mainly reflecting higher income from its mortgage banking joint venture, KBHS Home Loans, LLC (\"KBHS\").KBHS originated 79% of the residential mortgage loans the Company\u2019s homebuyers obtained to finance their home purchase, compared to 72%.Total pretax income grew 10% to $101.3 million. As a percentage of revenues, pretax income increased 220 basis points to 10.1% from 7.9%.The Company\u2018s income tax expense and effective tax rate were $22.9 million and approximately 23%, respectively. In the year-earlier quarter, income tax expense was $23.8 million and the effective tax rate was approximately 26%. The lower effective tax rate in the current quarter primarily reflected the favorable impact of federal energy tax credits.Net income grew 15% to $78.4 million, and diluted earnings per share increased 14% to $.83.Nine Months Ended August 31, 2020 (comparisons on a year-over-year basis)Story continuesTotal revenues of $2.99 billion were flat.Homes delivered decreased 2% to 7,796.Average selling price increased to $379,800.Pretax income grew 30% to $238.0 million.Net income increased 31% to $190.2 million and diluted earnings per share rose 30% to $2.02.Backlog and Net Orders (comparisons on a year-over-year basis)Net orders for the quarter grew 27% to 4,214, the Company\u2019s highest third-quarter level since 2005, with net order value increasing by $367.5 million, or 29%, to $1.64 billion. Both net orders and net order value increased in all of the Company\u2019s four regions.The Company\u2019s net order growth accelerated during the quarter, with monthly net orders up 11% in June, 23% in July and 50% in August. The Company\u2019s cancellation rate as a percentage of gross orders for the quarter improved to 17% from 20%.Company-wide, net orders per community averaged 5.9 per month, compared to 4.3.The Company\u2019s ending backlog increased 8% to 6,749 homes. Ending backlog value grew 12% to $2.57 billion. This marked the Company\u2019s highest third-quarter backlog, in terms of both homes and value, since 2007.Average community count for the quarter decreased 7% to 238. Ending community count of 232 was down 9%.Balance Sheet as of August 31, 2020 (comparisons to November 30, 2019)Cash and cash equivalents increased to $722.0 million, compared to $453.8 million.The Company had total liquidity of $1.51 billion, including cash and cash equivalents and $787.6 million of available capacity under its unsecured revolving credit facility. There were no cash borrowings outstanding under the facility. The Company has not borrowed under the facility in 2020.Inventories decreased slightly to $3.67 billion.The Company had 60,278 lots owned or under contract, of which approximately 63% were owned and 37% were under contract.The Company\u2019s 38,110 owned lots represented a supply of approximately 3.3 years, based on homes delivered in the trailing 12 months.Notes payable of $1.75 billion were essentially unchanged.The Company\u2019s debt to capital ratio of 40.5% improved 180 basis points. The Company\u2019s net debt to capital ratio improved 660 basis points to 28.6%.The Company\u2019s next scheduled debt maturity is on December 15, 2021, when $450.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 7.00% senior notes become due.Company Outlook \u2014 COVID-19 ImpactAlthough housing market conditions in the 2020 third quarter improved significantly from the prior quarter, the Company\u2019s deliveries and revenues for the period were tempered primarily by the negative impact that restrictive public health measures to combat the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 had on its second quarter. Since the easing of public health restrictions in its served markets beginning in May 2020, all of Company\u2019s communities have been open to walk-in traffic, following appropriate safety protocols and applicable public health guidelines. The Company also continues to engage with customers using its robust virtual selling capability, including enhanced online tools such as virtual home tours, interactive floor plans, live chats with sales counselors and online consultations with its design studios. Reflecting the shift in operating conditions, the Company\u2019s net orders began to rebound significantly in May following a low point in April, and the upward trajectory continued into the third quarter and accelerated as the quarter progressed.The Company is encouraged by the resilience of the housing market and the significant increase in demand over the past several months. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, demand remains strong, with the Company\u2019s net orders for the first three weeks of September 2020 up 32% from the corresponding period of 2019, and the cancellation rate for the period improving to 12% from 17%. While the Company limited its land investments during the second quarter and most of the third quarter to preserve cash and liquidity due to the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, given the sustained strong housing demand, it has resumed land acquisition and development activities to bolster its lot pipeline and support community growth in the future. Although the trajectory and strength of the current recovery remains uncertain, and it could be slowed or reversed by a number of factors, including a possible widespread resurgence in COVID-19 infections combined with the seasonal flu, the Company believes it is well positioned to operate effectively through the present environment.Conference Call The conference call to discuss the Company\u2019s 2020 third quarter earnings will be broadcast live TODAY at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time, 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time.

The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are relevant and useful to investors in understanding its operations and the leverage employed in its operations, and may be helpful in comparing the Company with other companies in the homebuilding industry to the extent they provide similar information. However, because they are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be completely comparable to other companies in the homebuilding industry and, thus, should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to operating performance and/or financial measures prescribed by GAAP. Rather, these non-GAAP financial measures should be used to supplement their respective most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in order to provide a greater understanding of the factors and trends affecting the Company\u2019s operations.Adjusted Housing Gross Profit MarginThe following table reconciles the Company\u2019s housing gross profit margin calculated in accordance with GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measure of the Company\u2019s adjusted housing gross profit margin:Three Months Ended August 31,Nine Months Ended August 31,2020201920202019Housing revenues$979,113$1,152,618$2,960,901$2,968,588Housing construction and land costs(784,427)(939,538)(2,414,059)(2,443,937)Housing gross profits194,686213,080546,842524,651Add: Inventory-related charges (a)6,8885,25116,93913,143Housing gross profits excluding inventory-related charges201,574218,331563,781537,794Add: Amortization of previously capitalized interest (b)30,18638,55893,507106,260Adjusted housing gross profits$231,760$256,889$657,288$644,054Housing gross profit margin19.9%18.5%18.5%17.7%Housing gross profit margin excluding inventory-related charges20.6%18.9%19.0%18.1%Adjusted housing gross profit margin23.7%22.3%22.2%21.7%(a) Represents inventory impairment and land option contract abandonment charges associated with housing operations.(b) Represents the amortization of previously capitalized interest associated with housing operations.Adjusted housing gross profit margin is a non-GAAP financial measure, which the Company calculates by dividing housing revenues less housing construction and land costs excluding (1) housing inventory impairment and land option contract abandonment charges (as applicable) recorded during a given period and (2) amortization of previously capitalized interest associated with housing operations, by housing revenues. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is housing gross profit margin. The Company believes adjusted housing gross profit margin is a relevant and useful financial measure to investors in evaluating the Company\u2019s performance as it measures the gross profits the Company generated specifically on the homes delivered during a given period. This non-GAAP financial measure isolates the impact that housing inventory impairment and land option contract abandonment charges, and the amortization of previously capitalized interest associated with housing operations, have on housing gross profit margins, and allows investors to make comparisons with the Company\u2019s competitors that adjust housing gross profit margins in a similar manner. The Company also believes investors will find adjusted housing gross profit margin relevant and useful because it represents a profitability measure that may be compared to a prior period without regard to variability of housing inventory impairment and land option contract abandonment charges, and amortization of previously capitalized interest associated with housing operations. This financial measure assists management in making strategic decisions regarding community location and product mix, product pricing and construction pace.Ratio of Net Debt to Capital The following table reconciles the Company\u2019s ratio of debt to capital calculated in accordance with GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measure of the Company\u2019s ratio of net debt to capital:August 31,2020November 30,2019Notes payable$1,747,704$1,748,747Stockholders\u2019 equity2,565,3082,383,122Total capital$4,313,012$4,131,869Ratio of debt to capital40.5%42.3%Notes payable$1,747,704$1,748,747Less: Cash and cash equivalents(722,033)(453,814)Net debt1,025,6711,294,933Stockholders\u2019 equity2,565,3082,383,122Total capital$3,590,979$3,678,055Ratio of net debt to capital28.6%35.2%The ratio of net debt to capital is a non-GAAP financial measure, which the Company calculates by dividing notes payable, net of homebuilding cash and cash equivalents, by capital (notes payable, net of homebuilding cash and cash equivalents, plus stockholders\u2019 equity). The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is the ratio of debt to capital. The Company believes the ratio of net debt to capital is a relevant and useful financial measure to investors in understanding the leverage employed in the Company\u2019s operations.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200922005311/en/ContactsJill Peters, Investor Relations Contact(310) 893-7456 or jpeters@kbhome.comCara Kane, Media Contact(321) 299-6844 or ckane@kbhome.com"}]}
