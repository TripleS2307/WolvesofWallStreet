Getting together for a round of \u201cFortnite\u201d or \u201cCall of Duty: Warzone\u201d or to visit the islands of friends and family in \u201cAnimal Crossing: New Horizons\u201d have become social events. I only see this type of behavior growing.\u201dOnline game 'Fortnite' enthusiasts attend the ESL Katowice Royale Featuring Fortnite Tournament during the Intel Extreme Masters Katowice 2019 event in Katowice on March 3, 2019. - World's top gamers vie for $500,000 in prizes at Fortnite International video game tournament.

That same day, Valve Corporation saw a then-record 20 million concurrent users on its Steam game distribution platform, and Microsoft\u2019s head of Xbox, Phil Spencer, tweeted that the service was seeing increases in users across the board.That uptick in new and returning gamers has translated to huge sales for gaming companies. On Aug. 6 Nintendo reported that its Q1 2020 operating profit grew an incredible 428%, with sales of the company\u2019s social simulator \u201cAnimal Crossing: New Horizons\u201d topping out at 10.63 million units for the quarter. Since the game\u2019s launch in March, Nintendo has sold an astonishing 22.4 million copies of the title.Nintendo said on August 6, 2020 that its quarterly net profit leapt to $1 billion, as the gaming industry enjoys extraordinary demand from players stuck at home because of the coronavirus pandemic.

King, Activision Blizzard\u2019s mobile games business, experienced a revenue jump of 11%.Take-Two Interactive (TTWO), which is responsible for games like \u201cGrand Theft Auto,\u201d saw revenue increase by 54%, hitting a record $831.3 million in its fiscal Q1 2020, while both Microsoft and Sony reported double-digit growth in their gaming businesses.Activision Blizzard's 'Call of Duty: Warzone' is a powerhouse that continues to perform for the gaming giant. (Image: Activision Blizzard)(MSFT) said that its Xbox business saw a 64% year-over-year jump in revenue, with Xbox hardware revenue up 49%. That\u2019s particularly impressive considering that Microsoft is expected to launch its new Xbox Series X console later this fall, which would usually translate to a slowdown in hardware sales.Sony (SNE), meanwhile, said that Q1 2020 sales in its PlayStation segment were up 32%. Most of that jump came from increases in game sales, as PlayStation 4 hardware sales were down year-over-year.Gaming\u2019s post-pandemic futureSo will the game industry see a dramatic drop in users when the pandemic subsides and people are once again able to venture out in public? Not according to Needham analyst Laura Martin.\u201cKnowing how long COVID-19 lasts is unimportant to our video game valuation thesis because video game companies benefit near term and long term from rapidly rising hours played, broadening demos, more new games tried, higher in-game spending, and limited/no live sports on TV during the pandemic,\u201d Martin wrote in a recent research note.Piscatella says it\u2019s as though the last two quarters have caused industry trends to jump ahead two years. One of those trends that game makers will be looking at moving forward is how to better integrate social interactions in games.\u201cBuilding more ways for friends and family to connect in gaming has been a big priority for developers even before the pandemic,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what\u2019s been made more clear is that building even more social features is a big part of the future of gaming.\u201dA screengrab from a special in-game showing of \"We The People\" at Fortnite\u2019s Party Royale on July 04, 2020 in South Pasadena, California. We The People is hosted by Van Jones, who is joined by Elaine Welteroth, former Editor-in-Chief of Teen Vogue, Jemele Hill, writer for The Atlantic, Killer Mike, rapper / songwriter, and hip hop musician Lil Baby. Van Jones and guests speak about how to change systemic racism in media, culture and entertainment. (Photo by Neilson Barnard/Getty Images)Titles like \u201cFortnite\u201d have been taking the lead on that, adding global concerts, movie trailers, and even panel discussions on topics like race in America that players can join in and watch through the game itself.But the impact on the industry goes beyond shortened timelines. Piscatella says that an increase in new gamers could bring about new kinds of games.\u201cIn the short term, it\u2019s been all about trying to get enough consoles, accessories and new content to satiate what has been very strong demand. Beyond that I think this increase in audience and engagement will only encourage more new content development, which will hopefully bring even more new players.\u201dAnd with Microsoft and Sony set to launch their newest consoles, the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5, in the fall, the industry is likely to see even greater growth moving forward.Got a tip?
