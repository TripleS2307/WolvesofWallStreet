As of Thursday morning, the 10-year U.S. Treasury (^TNX) was hovering near 67 basis points.The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston's President and CEO Eric S. Rosengren speaks during the \"Hyman P. Minsky Conference on the State of the U.S. and World Economies\", in New York, April 17, 2013. REUTERS/Keith Bedford (UNITED STATES - Tags: BUSINESS POLITICS)Rosengren admitted that his outlook for the economy is more pessimistic than those of his colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.In projections released by the FOMC last week, the median member of the 17-person committee forecast unemployment falling to 5.5% by the end of next year. But Rosengren suggested that unemployment could linger at higher levels if many of the temporary layoffs turned into permanent job losses as businesses shutter for good.Rosengren said fiscal support should prioritize relief for low and moderate income households, state and local governments, and small businesses.\u201cWe wouldn't need it if the pandemic was under control,\u201d Rosengren said. \u201cBut since the pandemic is not fully under control, I think it has to be targeted to those sectors of the economy that's been most impacted by the pandemic.\u201d\u2018Long way away\u2019 from raising ratesRosengren said the Fed is a \u201clong way away\u201d from raising interest rates, adding that the conversation over a rate hike may not be an issue until \u201ctwo or three years down the road.\u201dStory continuesIn a speech Wednesday, Rosengren said the Fed would keep rates near-zero until the economy reaches maximum employment and inflation appears on track to moderately exceed its 2% target for some time.Last month, the Fed announced a new approach to inflation that would allow the central bank to \u201cmoderately\u201d overshoot its 2% inflation target. The change is designed to compensate for years of undershooting its target, risking erosion of the Fed\u2019s credibility in stimulating the economy during downturns.However, Rosengren said a caveat is that if financial stability issues arise, the Fed could raise interest rates. The Boston Fed chief added that low interest rates are a contributing factor in the buildup of leveraged firms now going bust.\u201cThe hope is that financial stability issues are not that serious and that we're able to fully keep interest rates low in order to meet our inflation goal that [we] set out in the statement,\u201d Rosengren said.The next FOMC meeting is scheduled to take place November 4 and 5.Brian Cheung is a reporter covering the Fed, economics, and banking for Yahoo Finance.
