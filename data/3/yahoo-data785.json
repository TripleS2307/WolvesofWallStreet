Alex Azar and FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn cited positive statistics that showed a 35% reduction in mortality through the use of convalescent plasma from a non-peer-reviewed study.\u201cThe data we gathered suggests that patients who were treated early in their disease course, within three days of being diagnosed, with plasma containing high levels of antibodies, benefited the most from the treatment,\u201d Azar said.\u201cWe dream in drug development of something like a 35 percent mortality reduction. This is a major advance in the treatment of patients,\u201d he added.But Dr. Howard Koh, former HHS assistant secretary and professor of public health at Harvard, told Yahoo Finance that the portrayal of the statistic is incorrect. Where Hahn claimed a 35 in 100 improvement, the number is more like 3 in 100, based on the Mayo Clnic data.\u201cI think the announcement was way too premature. It shakes the confidence of the medical community about the rigor of the FDA\u2019s decision-making process right now,\u201d Koh said, adding that even as recently as a couple of days ago, there was tremendous internal debate from experts like NIH director Francis Collins and NIAID director Dr. Anthony Fauci about whether or not to approve the treatment.\u201cThis study from Mayo Clinic was not and is not intended to be a clinical trial. That comes from their own internal descriptions,\u201d he said.The move comes as the coronavirus crisis continues to escalate, raising the urgency for effective treatments and cures. While a significant find, experts point that it was not from studies which had a placebo control group\u2014 the gold standard for medical professionals to consider using new treatments.Story continuesMoreover, health experts are worried politics is at play, since it\u2019s the third EUA for a treatment issued by the FDA this year. The other two were for Gilead Science\u2019s (GILD) remdesivir\u2014 which is still being used\u2014 and hydroxychoroquine, which was eventually revoked.Dr. Dara Kass, a Yahoo Finance contributor and an emergency medicine doctor at Columbia University, said on Monday that the use of convalescent plasma has been in use for decades, insisting \u201cthere\u2019s no breakthrough here.\u201dRaising questions about how the data was used, she suggested the administration was \u201cbullying\u201d the FDA, raising questions about how that would affect vaccine development, which could yield a breakthrough by year\u2019s end.Koh echoed similar sentiments, saying, \u201cWhat this announcement does is raises a lot of red flags about the future vaccine.\u201dCases in the south are beginning to subside. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)\u2018Not the same as approval\u2019President Donald Trump touted the treatment Sunday, saying that the FDA has \u201cmade the independent decision\u201d to authorize the plasma, and that his administration \u201ccleared the logjam\u201d to approving it in the past week, even as he insisted the decision had \u201cnothing to do with politics.\u201dHahn explained that like remdesivir, the authorization is a legal route for the FDA to expand use and access to the treatment, even as more data is being collected.\u201cThis is not the same as an approval,\u201d he said, adding that the data he has seen is significant.\u201cThere was a really good rationale for why this might work. We are waiting for more data, we\u2019re going to continue to gather data, but this clearly meets the data we\u2019ve established\u201d for an EUA, Hahn said.Convalescent plasma is taken from recovered patients, relying on the antibodies they have built up to help patients still battling the virus. The FDA granted expanded access and federal funding helped support the program at Mayo Clinic in April. To-date, more than 100,000 individuals have enrolled, with more than 70,000 having received treatment, according to Hahn.Questions about who is donating, and how long after recovery, add uncertainty to the quality of the supply, and much is still unknown about the long-lasting effects of antibodies, according to experts.Dr. Kevin Tracey, president and CEO of the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research at Northwell Health, told Yahoo Finance Monday that while more than 600 individuals have received plasma treatment at the New York health system, the data is still unknown.But moving forward, without a placebo arm already in place, it is unlikely clinical trials will see robust enrollment, because the patients can opt to directly have access rather than sign up for the 50% chance of receiving the treatment.\u201cThat happened to remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine, and now it happened to convalescent plasma,\u201d Tracey said.The World Health Organization also expressed its concern, with chief scientist Dr. Soumya Swaminathan saying the treatment is still experimental.Vaccine approval fearsThe weekend move by the Trump administration is raising concerns about the vaccine race, despite repeated assurances from the FDA to wait until a vaccine is proven safe and effective.A rising number think Trump may pressure the FDA to do so before November 3. Some companies are expected to provide early read-outs of the clinical trials results by September and October, but a full regulatory review is still required.Financial Times reported that the White House is trying to push for an early authorization for AstraZeneca\u2019s (AZN) vaccine candidate with Oxford University.Dr. Peter Marks, the FDA\u2019s leading vaccine expert, recently said he would resign if the FDA approves an unproven vaccine.So far, AstraZeneca, Moderna (MRNA), and Pfizer (PFE) with BioNTech (BNTX) are the leaders among developed countries, with Phase 3 trials testing 30,000 participants. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) recently announced the largest trial expected to start next month of 60,000 participants.Novavax (NVAX) announced it is entering Phase 2 trials for an older population, to study its vaccine candidate. That is in addition to an existing Phase 2 trial on 18-55 year olds being conducted in South Africa.The two trials are focused on testing the vaccine for safety, after which the company can enter Phase 3 to test on a larger population, and study the effectiveness and durability of the vaccine.Anjalee Khemlani is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
