Investors digested a new round of jobless claims that were higher than expected, alongside dimming prospects for more stimulus in the near-term.[Click here to read what\u2019s moving markets heading into Friday, Oct. 9] Shares of Regeneron (REGN) jumped after the drugmaker said it had submitted a request to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization of its Covid-19 antibody treatment, which had been taken by President Donald Trump after his Covid-19 diagnosis. And IBM (IBM) surged nearly 6% after announcing it was spinning off its managed infrastructure services business into its own public company.Traders had previously been clinging to hopes that some aid out of Washington \u2013 if not a multi-trillion dollar, comprehensive virus relief package \u2013 might transpire in the near-term.However, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in her weekly briefing on Thursday, dialed back expectations for some stimulus measures to be unleashed ahead of the November elections. Pelosi said she would not advance a standalone bill to provide relief to airlines, in absence of other stimulus measures. A day earlier, she had signaled she might be open to passing a smaller, targeted bill, which Trump had previously suggested he would support.House Democrats last week voted to advance a larger package to inject another $2.2 trillion in aid to various parts of the economy.\u201cIt\u2019s been the question of the day, as to why we got the tweets we got over the last 24 hours, the market reaction we got into [Tuesday\u2019s] close, and then the rally today,\u201d Ed Mills, Raymond James Washington policy analyst, told Yahoo Finance Wednesday afternoon.\u201cInvestors I\u2019ve spoken to at Raymond James have been mixed. Some believe that this makes it much more likely that regardless of the outcome of the election, there\u2019s a deal to be had in the lame duck [session] before the Dec. 11 deadline to funding the government,\u201d he added. \u201cOthers said this is a clear signal from the market that they are now expecting a Democratic sweep. That would be the package that would be the largest. However, that might have to wait until February or March to be fully implemented.\u201dStory continuesMeanwhile, Federal Reserve officials continued to voice their concerns that the tenuous economic recovery would be weakened in absence of further near-term fiscal stimulus.In minutes released Wednesday covering the central bank\u2019s September meeting, the central bank said that \u201cmany participants noted that their economic outlook assumed additional fiscal support and that if future fiscal support was significantly smaller or arrived significantly later than they expected, the pace of the recovery could be slower than anticipated.\u201dAnother sign of tepid economic activity arrived Thursday via the Labor Department\u2019s weekly jobless claims report, which checked in at 840,000. Consensus economists expect to see another 820,000 new claims filed last week, up marginally from the prior week. However, continuing claims \u2014 a closely watched metric \u2014 fell unexpectedly to below 11 million.\u20144:03 p.m. ET: Stocks post back-to-back sessions of gains as investors weigh stimulus hopes against worse-than-expected jobless claimsHere were the main moves in markets as of 4:03 p.m. ET:S&P 500 (^GSPC): +27.40 (+0.80%) to 3,446.85Dow (^DJI): +122.11 (+0.43%) to 28,425.57Nasdaq (^IXIC): +56.38 (+0.50%) to 11,420.98Crude (CL=F): +$1.29 (+3.23%) to $41.24 a barrelGold (GC=F): +$7.00 (+0.37%) to $1,897.80 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): -2 bps to yield 0.7650%\u201411:12 a.m. ET: Stocks extend gains, led by energy sharesThe three major indices added to gains Thursday afternoon, with the Dow increasing more than 100 points, or 0.4%.
