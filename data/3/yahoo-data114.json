When asked what advice he would give new New York Mets owner and financier Steve Cohen, the Queens-born Blank and author of new book \u201cGood Company\u201d said a tremendous amount of listening needs to be done to make the Mets a winning organization again. Cohen\u2019s listening tour should run from fans\u2019 gripes about the team (and there are many with the Mets) and issues inside the organization.That approach is the only way the long under-achieving Mets may find success, well, that and Cohen (worth a reported $14 billion) opening up the payroll pocketbook that outgoing owners the Wilpons have mostly kept closed in recent years, post Madoff scandal.Says Blank, \u201cSo I would say in the case of the Mets and the people inside the building, tell [Cohen should tell them] them I understand your feelings. I understand your ideas and notions and what we have to do to fix the franchise.\u201dThe Long Island, N.Y.-born Cohen finally won the bidding battle for the Mets this week, shelling out $2.4 billion to get the job done.To be sure, the controversial Cohen would be wise to read up on Blank\u2019s story \u2014 he has a knack for winning.Feb 1, 2020; Miami, Florida, USA; Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank appears on the red carpet prior to the NFL Honors awards presentation at Adrienne Arsht Center. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY SportsBlank and Bernie Marcus co-founded Home Depot in 1978 after being surprisingly fired from their jobs at Handy Dan Home Improvement. Joining Blank and Marcus in the venture \u2014 which was seen as novel at the time for its expansive array of home improvement products in a large store format \u2014 was financier Ken Langone and veteran retail executive Pat Farrah.Blank was forced out as CEO in 2001 (a position he assumed in 1997) as he moved to an executive chairman role) in a shocking move by the board. In came GE Jack Welch disciple Bob Nardelli as CEO, who viewed by many inside and outside Home Depot as almost ruining the company by slashing costs and caring little about customer service. While Nardelli was running Home Depot into the ground (as detailed in Blank\u2019s book), Blank bought the Atlanta Falcons in 2002 for $545 million.Story continuesHe has remained an owner ever since. Meantime, Nardelli received the boot long ago \u2014 replaced by highly regarded retail executive Frank Blake and then more recently, his hand-picked successor Craig Menear. Both executives have done their part in leading Home Depot\u2019s stock price to record highs by re-focusing the company back on Blank\u2019s core values and making an aggressive push online.Today, Home Depot\u2019s market cap is a cool $306 billion and the Falcons are reportedly worth nearly $3 billion.Here\u2019s what Blank\u2019s co-founder Bernie Marcus recently told Yahoo Finance about the state of small businesses amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
