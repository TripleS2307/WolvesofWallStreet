Severance payments and employee benefits account for $210 million, pre-tax. The cost of closing some offices will cost the company about $80 million, pre-tax.\u201cImplementing this plan is difficult as we still deal with the impact of the pandemic but necessary to provide customers the best value,\u201d Tom Wilson, Allstate\u2019s chairman, president and CEO, said in a news release.The company is expanding transition support for impacted employees, including extended medical coverage, retraining support and help in employment searches, Wilson said.Ben Corey, a spokesman for Allstate, declined to comment on how many, if any, of the jobs being eliminated are in the Chicago area, or say which offices are closing.The plan also includes getting rid of its Esurance brand and consolidating Encompass Insurance, a subsidiary that sells personal property and casualty insurance, and Answer Financial, a website that allows customers to compare quotes. The company will continue to sell home, renters, auto and life insurance policies online, under the Allstate name.The company also said it will invest in marketing and technology.Allstate\u2019s second-quarter earnings topped estimates, and during an earnings call in early August, executives said the company had made progress on its plan.\u201c\u2026I\u2019d say our cost reductions, again, are a core part of transformative growth,\u201d Mario Rizzo, chief financial officer, said on the call with investors. \u201cSo I\u2019d say that\u2019s really what we\u2019re focused on doing as part of the plan.\u201dStory continuesEarlier this year, Allstate announced it was purchasing New York-based insurer National General Holdings for about $4 billion.The company\u2019s home office complex consists of several buildings totaling 1.9 million square feet of office space on a 186-acre site. It also operates out of about 450 smaller offices throughout North America, has offices in Northern Ireland, India and London.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u00a92020 Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC."}]}
