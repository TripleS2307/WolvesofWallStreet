The forecast is a remarkable downgrade from the IMF\u2019s -3% projection in April, making it the worst print in the report\u2019s history.For the first time, the IMF projects negative growth in every region of the world, as some areas re-open their economies and concerns of more coronavirus cases resurface.\u201cEven though countries are opening up, people are not spending ... They\u2019re saving more.\u201d said Lipsky. \u201cThe fear factor, the rise in infections, all of that is slowing consumption and that\u2019s the drag on the global economy right now.\u201dThe IMF predicts the U.S. economy to contract by 8% in 2020, with a slow recovery starting in 2021.A dealer wearing a protective face mask waits for customers before the reopening of the D Las Vegas hotel and casino, Wednesday, June 3, 2020, in Las Vegas.

I think there\u2019s a risk of a lost decade here.\u201dStory continuesInes covers the U.S. stock market from the floor of the New York Exchange.
