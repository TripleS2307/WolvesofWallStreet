The fact that rent is dipping this time of year is unusual,\u201d said Chris Salviati, housing economist at Apartment List.The fact that rent is dipping this time of year is unusual,\u201d said Chris Salviati, housing economist at Apartment List.Declining demand for pricey rentals caused gains to underperform. A third of Americans say they are less likely to move due to the pandemic, and of those who are moving, one-fifth say it\u2019s because they need to find a more affordable apartment, according to an Apartment List survey of 4,000 Americans on July 3.\u201cWe are seeing an unprecedented spike in unemployment. Folks are facing sudden and unexpected financial hardship.\u201d said Salviati. \u201cThe most common reason people are moving is because they need to find more affordable housing than where they\u2019re currently living.\u201dExpensive markets and areas driven by tourism economies continued to see large rent declines in July. San Francisco asking rent has dropped 1.1% in July from a month earlier and is down 3.3% since March. And New York asking rent in July dropped 1% and 2.8% from June and March, respectively. San Jose and Miami also saw July asking rent drop more than 2% since March, each losing 0.5% and 0.3% in July from June, respectively.\u201cYou see people within the market moving from desirable downtown areas and moving further afield\u2026 We are seeing migration out of pricey areas while mostly staying within local territories,\u201d said Anthemos Georgiades, CEO of Zumper, a San Francisco-based rental listing website.Meanwhile, rent prices in small, inexpensive cities have risen faster than average. In Henderson, Nevada, asking rent for a one-bedroom climbed 5.4% in July from June, and in Tulsa, Okla. one-bedroom asking rent increased 5.1% in July, according to Zumper.Story continues\u201cRent increases are mainly because of the increase in demand for smaller cities. People have at least made medium-term decisions\u2026 They are spending a year living near their families out of state \u2014 especially younger folks without kids in school,\u201d said Georgiades.July marks the first month when rent prices rose since March, when the pandemic hit the U.S. But the rental market is entering its slow season in the fall and winter, so rent prices are not likely to continue to increase as they did in July, said Salviati.\u201cIt\u2019s starting to look like the sharp V-shaped recovery is less and less likely. It may be more of a long drawn out recovery, as folks struggle with unemployment for a decent amount of time. So we may continue to see some softness in the market,\u201d Salviati said.Sarah Paynter is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
