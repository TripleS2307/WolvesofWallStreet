Because the most sophisticated investors around are starting to get a bit worried if the markets have gotten overextended for a host of reasons, suggests the father of online trading.\u201cOn the professional side, what we see from our investors is most of them have accumulated cash, selling into this rally. As a matter of fact, today they\u2019re sitting on something like $72 billion in customer cash. Basically, there are two lines of thought here,\u201d said Interactive Brokers founder and chairman Thomas Peterffy on Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade. \u201cOne is that if you don\u2019t get into this market, you will never see these prices again because the Fed keeps pumping money into the market and inflation is going to catch up with us very soon and stocks are a safe-haven. And the other thing is that it doesn\u2019t matter how much money is in the market, companies will have difficulty earning a profit. So that\u2019s where we are.\u201dWASHINGTON, DC - DECEMBER 8: Thomas Peterffy, CEO of Interactive Brokers, speaks during a joint hearing of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee Securities, Insurance, and Investment Subcommittee and Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Investigations Subcommittee on Capitol Hill December 8, 2010 in Washington, DC. The committee called Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro and others to testify about the integrity and US Capital Markets.

Since then he has been a champion of online trading as a means to lower transaction prices and bring more people into the investing fold.Today, Interactive Brokers has more than 760,000 client accounts spanning the U.S., Asia and Europe. The average account size is $230,000, reflecting a platform that is geared more toward professional investors with access to some of the best information on markets around.In the process, Peterffy has amassed a net worth of about $14.5 billion.So, when Peterffy says clients on his platform are raising cash \u2014 while the broader market is still rallying \u2014it should set off a few caution signals to the bulls.Adds Peterffy, \u201cThey believe that the market is overvalued, right, because the economy is basically suffering and we don\u2019t see a quick turnaround on the horizon.\u201dStory continuesBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
