And Disney (DIS) would get the benefit of seeing how a competitor blockbuster fares, Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cTenet,\u201d scheduled for July 17 release.Disney CEO Bob Chapek even noted on the company\u2019s Q2 earnings call on May 5, \u201cWe're going to get a pretty good idea of [moviegoer confidence] because there's a competitive movie that opens one week before our film. At that point, we\u2019re hoping that there\u2019s some return to a semblance of normal.\u201dNow, as COVID-19 cases have spiked again in a number of states, plans have changed.On June 12, Warner Brothers (T) delayed the release of \u201cTenet\u201d from July 17 to July 31. (It also pushed \u201cWonder Woman 1984\u201d from Aug. 14 to Oct. 2.) On Thursday, Warner Brothers again pushed back \u201cTenet,\u201d to Aug. 12. That leaves \u201cMulan\u201d up first as the movie theater industry\u2019s big test to see if Americans are ready to sit in a theater.Now Disney is considering pushing \u201cMulan\u201d again, according to the Wall Street Journal.That would make a lot of sense, especially as Disney has just delayed the reopening of Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif., planned for July 17, after the Coalition of Resort Labor Unions planned to protest the reopening, and after California said it will not issue its theme park reopening guidance until after July 4.Disney World in Orlando, Fla., is still set to reopen on July 11, but that date is now also widely expected to get pushed.A poster of the Walt Disney Studios' \"Mulan\" movie, which was going to be released on March 27, towers over an empty Hollywood Boulevard during the global outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, U.S., March 31, 2020. REUTERS/Lucy NicholsonWhat Disney does next with regards to the \u201cMulan\u201d release date will affect the entire movie theater industry. AMC last week announced it will reopen 450 of its U.S. theaters on July 15. But without \u201cMulan\u201d on July 24, why reopen? The theaters would have no anchor blockbuster to show.In some ways, it now looks like a game of chicken between Disney and Warner Brothers: Neither studio wants to be the first to try a big box-office release amid the pandemic. And the reopening of movie theaters this summer is extremely controversial. When AMC first announced it would reopen theaters, it said it would not require moviegoers to wear masks; CEO Adam Aron told Variety on June 18, \u201cWe did not want to be drawn into a political controversy... if we forced mask-wearing on those people who believe strongly that it is not necessary.\u201d The comments were roundly criticized.Story continuesIt took less than 24 hours for the company to reverse course and say it will require masks at all theaters (AMC said, \u201cWe did not go far enough\u201d), but the damage was done.If \u2018Mulan\u2019 and \u2018Tenet\u2019 keep getting delayed, the reopening of movie theater chains will likely delay in response.Amid Disney\u2019s multiple movie delays, some have wondered if Disney might just release \u201cMulan\u201d onto Disney+ as a way to lure new subscribers. Disney already put \u201cOnward\u201d on Disney+ earlier than planned in April, just one month after its theatrical release, and released \u201cArtemis Fowl\u201d straight to Disney+ this month.But it\u2019s unlikely to do that with \u201cMulan\u201d after its last few live-action remakes were mega cash cows at the box office: \u201cAladdin\u201d and \u201cLion King\u201d both banked more than $1 billion last year. Disney is likely willing to wait as long as it takes, until moviegoers demonstrate their comfort, to put \u201cMulan\u201d into theaters and reap the ticket sales. In the meantime, theater chains have their eyes on both Disney and Warner Brothers.This story was updated at 12:49am EST on June 26 with the latest delay of \u201cTenet.\u201d\u2014Daniel Roberts is an editor-at-large at Yahoo Finance.
