SubscribeRounds played are surging and the golf business is following suit.During the COVID-19 pandemic, maintaining social distance from others has become the most important, and simplest, way to slow the spread of the virus.And few recreational activities offer a built-in social distancing protocol as easily as the sport of golf. And as a result, the entire golf industry has been booming during the summer of 2020.On Wednesday, Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods (DKS) \u2014 which owns Golf Galaxy and also sells golf apparel, equipment, and accessories at Dick\u2019s locations \u2014 reported second quarter results that smashed expectations.Dick\u2019s reported same-store sales rose 20.7% during the second quarter, even with 15% of locations closed, on average, during the quarter. Wall Street analysts were looking for same-store sales to rise by less than half this amount, according to data from Bloomberg.Revenue at Dick\u2019s in the second quarter totaled $2.71 billion with earnings per share coming at $3.21 per share. Online sales at Dick\u2019s \u2014 which includes curbside pick-up \u2014 rose 194% in the second quarter. Shares of Dick\u2019s rose 15.6% during Wednesday\u2019s session.And a standout during the quarter is what the company saw in its golf segment. An area that Dick\u2019s management expects will continue to be a point of strength for the company through the rest of the year.\u201cThe golf business has been great both at Dick\u2019s and [Golf] Galaxy,\u201d said Dick\u2019s CEO Ed Stack on the company\u2019s earnings conference call on Wednesday.\u201cThere\u2019s a number of young people who have come into the game because they\u2019re not playing football or soccer or some other sport,\u201d Stack added. \u201cSo they\u2019re out playing [golf]. Guys are out playing golf because they\u2019re not at their kids\u2019 games. Men, women, and kids have really all jumped into this game and we expect that to continue through the balance of the year, too.\u201dStory continuesStack cited the ongoing PGA TOUR playoffs, the upcoming U.S. Open (set to be held September 17-20), and The Masters (set for November 12-15) as positive catalysts for recreational golfers maintaining interest in the sport after the COVID-related uptick in enthusiasm.\u201cSo we think golf is one of those categories that\u2019s going to be...very good,\u201d Stack said.The latest data from the National Golf Foundation showed that in June, national rounds played were up 13.9%, indicating that up to 8 million more rounds were played in June compared to last year. This followed a 6.2% increase in rounds played in May, the first month that many courses were open after mandated shutdowns in the spring.Data from the NGF for July rounds played has not yet been released. But anecdotal reports from this story\u2019s author shows tee time availability at public courses in the Tristate area remains severely constrained.Data from the NPD Group published in late July also pointed to a strong summer for the golf business, with the firm\u2019s data showing that golf equipment sales rose 51% in June after a 22% increase in May.NPD sports industry advisor Matt Powell said, \u201cThe golf industry was in a good place before the COVID-19 crisis, largely due to a surge of retirees entering the market, and in May we started to see this health returning. Today\u2019s growth is driven by new players as well as pent-up demand from the closures of physical golf retail stores and golf courses.\u201dEarlier this month, results from golf manufacturers Callaway (ELY) and Acushnet Holdings (GOLF) \u2014 which owns Titleist and FootJoy \u2014 also indicated a big turnaround in the sport through the summer months.Callaway CEO Chip Brewer said that during the second quarter the company\u2019s business had been \u201crecovering faster than we initially projected.\u201dSales at Callaway were still down 34% during the second quarter, but the company noted that equipment sales rose 21% in June, the quarter\u2019s final month. Brewer added that the company\u2019s sales recovery in July was better than what had been seen in June, citing both \u201cnew participation and pent-up demand.\u201dAt Acushnet, sales fell 35% during the second quarter, but Acushnet CEO David Maher told analysts this month that \u201cthe game and business of golf have been incredibly resilient over the past [few] months.\u201d The company said in its release that demand for golf balls had been particularly strong, indicating a pickup in rounds played.And on the company\u2019s earnings call, Maher added that, \u201cwe continue to exercise caution in our planning, given COVID-related uncertainties, while at the same time, our teams are preparing to capitalize on the high levels of participation and consumer demand we have seen over the past two to three months.\u201dShares of both Callaway (up 4.1%) and Acushnet (up 0.8%) were higher on Wednesday following results from Dick\u2019s.By Myles Udland, reporter and co-anchor of The Final Round.
