The company recently acquired a majority interest in a developmental-stage professional fantasy football league, which will allow the Hall of Fame Village resort to offer virtual reality and augmented reality football experiences.\u201cWe want to put people in the game,\u201d said Crawford. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked a lot about putting our fans in the game and letting them feel what it would really be like to be a part of that huddle.\u201dRenderings provided by the Hall of Fame Resort & Entertainment Company.Amid the coronavirus pandemicOn Monday, the Canadian Football League canceled its season and so far the NFL is scheduled to start its season September 10, but even if the coronavirus upends the NFL\u2019s plan the resort\u2019s stakeholders aren\u2019t likely to get spooked about its future prospects, according to the company.Story continues\u201cThe power of professional football, the infrastructure that we have here, and certainly the support from the city and the government, we feel like it's a great recipe for success,\u201d Crawford said.Renderings provided by the Hall of Fame Resort & Entertainment Company.It also helps that travel patterns have shifted this summer, boosting tourism to drive-to tourist destinations, and half of NFL franchises are within an eight-hour drive of the Village. The Hall of Fame Village is now an even more attractive destination for the tens of millions of football fans within a day\u2019s drive of the resort, according to Crawford.\u201cI think that sports is not only important for the players playing it but also for those who are watching it. And so hopefully we can return to some sense of normalcy,\u201d said Martin. \u201cMy hope is that there\u2019s something that we can do to get back to playing sports.\u201dRenderings provided by the Hall of Fame Resort & Entertainment Company.Sarah Paynter is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
