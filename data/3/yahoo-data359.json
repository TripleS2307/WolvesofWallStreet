Fed officials had previously been guided by the idea that the unemployment rate could be too low, at which point the economy may experience higher inflation.In practice, this could take the form of a labor market where employers have to bid wages up to attract workers, which could require those employers to then raise prices on goods or services.That\u2019s what led the Fed, under Chair Janet Yellen, to raise the benchmark interest rate in December 2015 - from near-zero to 25 basis points. Yellen has likened that decision to taking the Fed\u2019s foot off the gas pedal of accommodative borrowing costs, defending the move as a way of keeping the economy from \u201coverheating and inflation from significantly overshooting our objective.\u201dThe unemployment rate at the time was 5.1%.Prior to the COVID-19 crisis however, the unemployment rate fell as low as 3.5% with no signs of runaway inflation. Year-over-year changes in core personal consumption expenditures (the Fed\u2019s preferred measure of inflation, which excludes food and energy prices) have averaged about 1.6% since the Fed adopted its 2% target in 2012 - a persistent undershoot.Former Fed Chair Janet Yellen.

All the while, the Fed would be focused on pulling in more workers into jobs.Fed officials have pointed to the fact that marginalized people, such as low-income and Black workers, are among the last to experience employment gains in an economic recovery.Brainard suggested that if the Fed had held off on raising rates, it may have arrived at 3.5% unemployment faster.\u201cThe gains would have been greater,\u201d Brainard said Tuesday.In a webinar on Tuesday, Yellen said she supported the framework changes but defended the Fed\u2019s early rate increases on the grounds that the unemployment rate continued to fall.\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say if our goal had been to overshoot 2% inflation, perhaps we would have waited a little bit longer to start the process of raising interest rates,\u201d Yellen said. \u201cSo there is some truth that it might have made some difference, but I don\u2019t think it would have made an extreme difference.\u201dFor his part, current Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the central bank\u2019s view is that \u201ca robust job market can be sustained without causing an outbreak of inflation.\u201dWithin the current context, the Fed finds itself grappling with a labor market in which 14.5 million Americans, sidelined by the coronavirus, are relying on unemployment insurance. Powell has said the Fed is \u201cnot even thinking about thinking about thinking about raising rates.\u201dThe Fed\u2019s next policy-setting meeting will take place September 15-16.Brian Cheung is a reporter covering the Fed, economics, and banking for Yahoo Finance.
