(Photo Illustration by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)The S&P 500 index (^GSPC) clocked an all-time high on Feb. 19, when it closed at 3,386. About a month later, the coronavirus crisis took the index hundreds of points down to 2,237.The Covid-19 pandemic still flares throughout the U.S. as the economy struggles with alarming unemployment levels, but somehow in mid-August, the index is a hair from its Feb. 19 high \u2014 99.6% there as the market index hovers around 3,376.By and large, the pandemic has been awful for millions of workers who\u2019ve lost their jobs and businesses that have had to close. But for people who own stocks, it\u2019s been surprisingly good.Interestingly though, retail investors are the one group that piled into stocks when no one else wanted to touch them, as pandemic fears reached fever pitch.In the earlier days of the pandemic, retail inventors at Fidelity and Vanguard actually put money into the stock market, \u201cbuying the dip.\u201d\u201cDuring the last week of February and the first week of March, the majority of households trading moved money into equities rather than into fixed income (bonds and cash),\u201d Vanguard\u2019s Amy Lash told Yahoo Finance at the time. \u201cMore than 7 in 10 households trading moved into equities.\u201dFrom then on, this trend continued amid the broader sell-off, and then into the market climb.In early June, Deutsche Bank strategist Parag Thatte looked at investor flows and positioning and found all investor groups \u2013 except for retail investors \u2013 had record low-exposure to the stock market. While the whole Robinhood boom seemed anecdotal, day traders and long-term investors alike had been buying the dip.More recent data from Thatte from late July indicated that new retail investors have continued to \u201cramp up exposure,\u201d citing the number of accounts on Robinhood, via Robintrack data. One of the ways Deutsche Bank and other analysts at Goldman Sachs see this is by looking at big stocks retail investors love, versus other stocks.(Goldman Sachs)Robinhood users have jumped into tech and megacap stocks like Amazon.Story continues(Deutschebank)\u201cPerformance across sectors has been closely correlated with increases in retail exposure,\u201d Thatte said.The trend seems to be somewhat international. In Australia, the Australian Financial Review reported that $9 billion of retail investor money had flowed into stocks as $11 billion of institutional money had flowed out.Retail investors winThere are a lot of ways to read this. One could be by saying pros made poorer decisions compared to retail investors, who may have succeeded in internalizing Warren Buffett aphorisms like \u201cbe greedy when others are fearful.\u201dBut it\u2019s not clear that was the best decision even if it led to the better outcome \u2014 they could have simply gotten lucky. One thing is clear though: retail investors have won the rally so far.\u201cSince we have had no serious drawdown then those who had acquired [the S&P 500 Index] below 2,900 would have done very well,\u201d said Sean Darby, global equity strategist at Jefferies, who also studies investor flows.The retail investor craze has involved a lot of momentum trading and people deciding to buy what they know \u2014 specifically big stocks like Amazon (AMZN) and other megacap tech names. This, Darby added, means that the win might be even bigger than the index.\u201cIt needs to be remembered that they might have done even better than the index given that a handful of stocks have made very impressive gains,\u201d he told Yahoo Finance.--Ethan Wolff-Mann is a writer at Yahoo Finance focusing on consumer issues, personal finance, retail, airlines, and more.
