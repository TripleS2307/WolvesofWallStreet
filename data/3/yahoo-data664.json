The state has in recent days been battling a resurgence in new and serious cases of the coronavirus after beginning to ease lockdown orders. Other populous states including Florida have struggled with similar trends amid their reopenings, with both it and Arizona posting record daily highs for new cases of the virus earlier this week.Earlier in the session, prospects of more stimulus, as well as hopes of a Covid-19 treatment and speedy economic recovery, helped stocks extend gains. These catalysts included reports Tuesday of encouraging results from a trial showing that the generic drug dexamethasone helped reduce the death risk among patients with severe Covid-19 cases.Meanwhile, earlier reports that the Trump administration was prepping a nearly $1 trillion infrastructure package also provided a boost to risk assets.More promising signs of a speedy economic recovery also contributed to the rally. New economic data Tuesday morning showed retail sales surged by a record 17.7% in May over April, with the pace of increase more than double the rate consensus economists expected. The sharp recovery in consumer spending after April\u2019s record decline led at least some economists to pare back their gloomier economic expectations for the second quarter this year.\u201cThe 17.7% m/m rebound in retail sales in May indicates that, as the lockdowns were eased in many states, activity started to recover more quickly than we \u2013 and others \u2013 had been anticipating,\u201d Andrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist for Capital Economics, wrote in a note. \u201cAs a result, we now estimate that real consumption and overall GDP both contracted at a 30% annualized pace in the second quarter, rather than the 40% fall we previously expected.\u201dStory continuesWhile the latest batch of new economic data, including the May jobs report earlier this month, has surprised sharply to the upside, many economists and policymakers continue to call attention to risks of protracted economic weakness, as long as the coronavirus pandemic continues.Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, for his part, said during testimony before the Senate Banking Committee Tuesday that, \u201c Until the public is confident that the disease is contained, a full recovery is unlikely.\u201dPowell, also began testifying before the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday afternoon, also defended the Fed\u2019s recently announced decision to expand its purchases in the secondary market to include individual corporate bonds, saying the central bank wants \u201cto be there if things turn bad in the economy.\u201d\u20144:03 p.m. ET: S&P, Dow snap 3-day win streak, Apple sets all-time intraday highHere were the main moves in markets as of 4:03 p.m. ET:S&P 500 (^GSPC): -11.26 (-0.36%) to 3,113.48Dow (^DJI): -170.37 (-0.65%) to 26,119.61Nasdaq (^IXIC): +14.66 (+0.15%) to 9,910.53Crude (CL=F): -$0.72 (-1.88%) to $37.66 a barrelGold (GC=F): -$0.10 (-0.01%) to $1,736.40 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): -2.3 bps to yield 0.7330%\u20143:21 p.m. ET: Hertz suspends plan to sell $500 million shares due to SEC reviewHertz said in a filing Wednesday afternoon it planned to halt its plan to sell $500 million worth of shares after the Securities and Exchange Commission told the company it would conduct a review of its prospectus supplement for the deal.The share sale is suspended \u201cpending further understanding of the nature and timing\u201d of the review, according to the filing.Shares of Hertz had been halted on the New York Stock Exchange earlier in the session.\u201412:33 p.m. ET: Powell says it would be \u2018appropriate\u2019 for Congress to unleash additional stimulusFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday afternoon in his appearance before the House Financial Services Committee that he felt it would be \u201cappropriate\u201d for Congress to unveil more unemployment support for individuals and stimulus for businesses.Powell has previously called for further fiscal policy to complement the stimulus provided through monetary policy. In his remarks, he also underscored that the stimulus has had a notably positive effect on consumer spending, income and payrolls since the beginning of the pandemic.\u201411:45 a.m. ET: Shares of Hertz halted on the NYSE for news pendingShares of bankrupt car rental company Hertz (HTZ) were halted on the New York Stock Exchange Wednesday just before noon, due to pending news.The company, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in late May, has in recent days drawn scrutiny for its court request to sell up to $1 billion worth of new shares.
