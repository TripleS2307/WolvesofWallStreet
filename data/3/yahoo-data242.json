REUTERS/Florence Lo/IllustrationAfter TikTok rejected its bidThe great TikTok bidding war appears to be sewn up with Oracle coming in as the winner, or, as the company said, the \u201cpreferred technology partner,\u201d of the upstart social media app owned by China\u2019s ByteDance. And that leaves Microsoft (MSFT), which was seemingly the only serious contender for the platform, as the loser.Oracle (ORCL) confirmed the proposal, which it and TikTok hope will allay President Trump and security experts\u2019 fears that the app poses a national security risk, though we don\u2019t know what the deal itself will look like just yet.Microsoft\u2019s failure to secure at least a partnership with TikTok is a setback for the company in a number of ways. It means the tech giant won\u2019t reach the millions of teens who use the social network, which allows users to share and view short-form videos, and expand its name recognition among Gen Zers outside of its Office software and Xbox.It also loses out on the data those teens generate, which could help it develop more products and add to advertising business.But there could be a silver lining to Microsoft\u2019s loss in that it won\u2019t have to deal with the potential fallout that may come if the deal doesn\u2019t work in the long run. It also helps Microsoft escape the kind of scrutiny that comes with working alongside a consumer-focused social network.Name recognition and valuable dataMicrosoft initially sought a deal to acquire TikTok, but that fell apart when Chinese government officials put new regulations in place restricting the export of certain artificial intelligence technologies including the algorithm that serves up recommended videos to TikTok users based on their tastes.Microsoft said it would have needed access to the algorithm to ensure the safety and privacy of U.S. users and to combat the spread of disinformation.Story continuesIf Microsoft got access to TikTok via a sale, it would have been the company behind the hottest social network since Snapchat. TikTok\u2019s appeal to teens and tweens allows it to gain insight into what drives and attracts those young users. But putting Microsoft\u2019s name in front of TikTok would also ensure that those same users see the 45-year-old company as almost synonymous with the social network.Teens don\u2019t need to use Windows-powered PCs like they did in the past, and if they do, they certainly don\u2019t spend nearly as much using those PCs as they had to in the past.They don\u2019t have to use Internet Explorer, or the new Edge Browser, because they, like 66% of users, are on Google\u2019s (GOOG, GOOGL) Chrome. They don\u2019t have to use Office, because they, along with 57% of consumers, use Google Docs. They don\u2019t have to use Bing because, well, they have Google. They might still use Windows PCs, but schools are increasingly buying up Google\u2019s Chromebooks.Oracle company signage is seen in front of the US-based technology company's office building in Beijing on September 16, 2020.

Microsoft missed the boat on mobile after its turn as a would-be third smartphone option when its Windows Phone operating system failed to gain traction and was killed off for good in 2019.In fact, the only area where teens might frequently use a Microsoft product is the Xbox, and even that doesn\u2019t have a majority market share in the gaming market, thanks to Sony\u2019s (SNE) PlayStation.But name recognition isn\u2019t all Microsoft missed out on. The company could have gotten access to untold amounts of data produced by TikTok\u2019s users. With that kind of information, Microsoft would have been able to further bolster its advertising business. That alone could have put Microsoft on a path to challenge the likes of Google and Facebook (FB) for domination of the online advertising industry.Avoiding scrutiny of a social networkMicrosoft, however, has been able to avoid the kind of scrutiny the likes of Google and Facebook have drawn from regulators in the U.S. and Europe exactly because it\u2019s largely uninvolved in collecting user data like those services. In fact, Microsoft President Brad Smith has been critical of tech companies and the data they horde.The vast majority of Microsoft\u2019s revenue comes from its enterprise, Windows, productivity, and Xbox businesses. But if the firm ended up jumping into the social media space, it would instantly open itself up to the same criticisms leveled as those other tech giants.It also ensures Microsoft doesn\u2019t have to deal with whatever additional drama a tie-up with TikTok would bring along with it. After all, the social network isn\u2019t just popular with teens. It\u2019s also popular among those in Washington who have turned it into a political football.By missing out on the TikTok deal, which isn\u2019t even the full acquisition Microsoft was seeking, it avoids more pain than a \u201ctechnology partnership\u201d would have offered. It\u2019s a win through a loss. And while it may mean that Microsoft won\u2019t be the company Gen Z comes to know as the brand behind the hottest social network of the moment, the company, and its more than $1-trillion market cap, will continue to do well on its own.By Daniel Howley, tech editor.
