It affects your relationship with your kids, your marriage \u2014 everything.\u201dThe outcome of the case represents a \u201cloosening of the student loan discharge law,\u201d Jason Iuliano, a bankruptcy expert and assistant professor of law at Villanova University, told Yahoo Finance.McDaniel 10th Opinion by AarthiNavient declined to comment on the specific case but provided the following statement: \u201cWe recognize that some student borrowers face long-term financial challenges, and this is why, for several years, Navient has recommended bankruptcy reform that would allow federal and private student loans to be dischargeable in bankruptcy after making a good-faith effort to repay.\u201dThe McDaniel case comes months after a separate ruling in favor of another student loan borrower, Kevin Rosenberg, who saw more than $200,000 of student loan debt discharged under Chapter 7 personal bankruptcy (liquidation bankruptcy). The loan servicer appealed the ruling. The Rosenberg case addressed the \u201cundue hardship\u201d standard imposed on borrowers to prove they needed their debts erased.Read more: What is bankruptcy and how does it work?The McDaniel case touches on the question of why student loans are generally exempt from being dischargeable in Chapter 13 personal bankruptcy (reorganization bankruptcy) in the first place.\u2018We just couldn\u2019t keep up with it\u2019McDaniel took out multiple student loans from Sallie Mae called \u201cTuition Answer Loan\u201d to pay for a degree she obtained in 2008 while juggling work and parental duties. She estimated that her master\u2019s and bachelor\u2019s degrees left her with $120,000 total in private loans.Story continues\u201cIt was astronomical,\u201d she recalled.When it was time to repay those loans, her monthly payments to Navient were more than $1,000. McDaniel said she told the company that she simply couldn\u2019t afford that, but loan officials were \u201cnot willing to work with me at all.\u201d She claimed that the company threatened to garnish her wages to recoup the debt.Paige McDaniel. (Courtesy of Paige McDaniel)\u201cWe just couldn\u2019t keep up with it,\u201d McDaniel said. \u201cAll of our other bills were paid on time. These were the only things we couldn\u2019t keep up with.\u201dIn 2009, McDaniel and her husband, Byron Patterson McDaniel, filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy because \u201cit was either that or we were getting to the point where we couldn\u2019t keep our house.\u201d The following year, the court confirmed an amended repayment plan submitted by the couple.\u201cIn early 2015, the McDaniels certified that they had carried out all of their plan\u2019s payments and obligations,\u201d the latest ruling stated. \u201cAccording to the Trustee\u2019s final report and account, the McDaniels had paid nearly $27,000 in principal toward Navient\u2019s debt claims under the confirmed plan.\u201dThe bankruptcy court then granted the McDaniels a discharge of their debts in March 2015. But, according to McDaniel, Navient had tacked on another $44,408.17 to their principal over that period.Navient \u201cadded more interest during the bankruptcy, which was ridiculous,\u201d McDaniel said. \u201cSo when we got out of the bankruptcy, we ended up owning them more than when we started. We were actually in worse shape than when we filed.\u201dNavient Corporation Indianapolis Location. (Getty, 2017)By the time the McDaniels were out of bankruptcy, their monthly student loan payment had ballooned to more than $2,000 a month \u2014 \u201cmore than my mortgage,\u201d according to McDaniel. Over the next two years, the latest ruling stated, \u201cthe McDaniels paid Navient an additional $37,460 on their Tuition Answer Loans.\u201dIn 2017, the couple asked the bankruptcy court to reopen their case and filed a complaint against Navient. But the loan servicer argued that the debt was not dischargeable, citing nuances of bankruptcy code, and moved the court to dismiss the McDaniels\u2019 complaint. The motion was denied, and Navient appealed.\u201cThis case raises a question of first impression in this circuit: does an educational loan constitute \u2018an obligation to repay funds received as an educational benefit,\u2019\u201d the Tenth Circuit wrote in the August 31, 2020, ruling on the appeal. \u201cWe conclude that it does not. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d)(2)(A), we affirm the bankruptcy court\u2019s interlocutory order denying Navient\u2019s motion and remand the case for further proceedings.\u201dAustin Smith of Smith Law Group, who represents the couple, told Yahoo Finance that the ruling \u201cis a total victory for the McDaniels. But we have won this issue before and it hasn't changed Navient's conduct.\u201dUnited States Bankruptcy Court on 19th Street in downtown Denver, Colorado, USA. (Getty)\u2018From presumptively non-dischargeable to automatically dischargeable\u2019Iuliano, the bankruptcy expert, said that the ruling could affect the dischargeability of private student loans more broadly, particularly those that either exceed the cost of attendance at an accredited school or private student loans from non-accredited Title IV schools.In other words, he added, the ruling potentially \u201cconverts a ton of student loan debt\u2026 if adopted nationally, tens of billions dollars, from presumptively non-dischargeable to automatically dischargeable.\u201dMore than 2.5 million people with student loan debt have filed for bankruptcy over the past decade, Iuliano\u2019s research, which will be published in The Student Loan Bankruptcy Gap, 70 Duke L.J. (forthcoming 2020), has found.In 2019 alone, roughly 221,000 student loan borrowers filed for personal bankruptcy.\u201cI want people who are kids who are going to college to know, you don't want to take out private student loans,\u201d McDaniel said. \u201cThere needs to be more protection for the borrowers. ... I don't know how to fix it. I really don\u2019t. But I know it's terribly, terribly broken.\u201d\u2014Aarthi is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. She can be reached at aarthi@yahoofinance.com.
