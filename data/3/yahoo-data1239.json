Though the ADP report is not always a reliable indicator of what the BLS report will illustrate, it could still provide insight into the current state of employment in the U.S.Economists surveyed by Bloomberg anticipate the U.S. economy added 3 million nonfarm payrolls during the month, up from 2.5 million job additions in May. The unemployment rate is expected to have ticked lower to 12.4% in June from 13.3% in the prior month.Meanwhile, the ISM manufacturing index will likely show continued improvement in June, according to Credit Suisse economist James Sweeney. \u201cShutdown orders have eased, which is leading to a rebound in the most-impacted sectors, but there is likely to be ongoing stress for manufacturers. In reality, most businesses are likely seeing sequential improvement in the past months, but PMI surveys often seem to measure something closer to 3m/3m growth.\u201d\u201cFalling business confidence and deep uncertainty about future COVID-19 contagion can also weigh on survey measures. Other manufacturing surveys have broadly improved so far in June, but the majority continue to show a slight contraction in growth,\u201d Sweeney added.Economists anticipate the ISM manufacturing index jumped to 49.5 in June from 43.1 in May. A reading above 50 signals expansion and a reading below 50 indicates contractionary territory.NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JUNE 23: People wear protective face masks outside Macy's Herald Square as the city moves into Phase 2 of re-opening following restrictions imposed to curb the coronavirus pandemic on June 23, 2020 in New York City.

By June 1, we had approximately 450 stores reopened, with the majority opened in their full format. Our reopened stores are performing better than anticipated. Importantly, we are receiving positive feedback on the curbside pickup experience and our efforts to create a safe and welcoming shopping environment,\u201d he added.The company also said that it was seeing strong sell-through of its seasonal merchandise and expects to exit the second quarter in a clean inventory position.Department stores had been struggling even before COVID-19 wreaked havoc on the retail industry.
