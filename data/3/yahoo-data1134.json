The S&P 500 came within 0.8% of its record closing high from February 19.[Click here to read what\u2019s moving markets heading into Tuesday, August 11]Investors digested a new slate of executive orders from President Donald Trump, who sidestepped Congress in moving ahead on Saturday with actions to provide support for the virus-hit economy. The executive orders drew the ire of Democratic lawmakers, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi calling the actions \u201cabsurdly unconstitutional\u201d during a CNN interview. Administration officials defended the orders, however, with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin saying on Fox News that the orders were cleared by the Office of Legal Counsel.The executive actions implement $400 weekly federal enhanced unemployment insurance benefit, relief for student borrowers, and temporary payroll tax suspension starting Sept. 1, and direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services and Director of the CDC to limit residential evictions and foreclosures. The move to quickly roll out these actions came after two weeks of talks in Congress failed to convene lawmakers around terms of a new relief bill.\u201cPresident Trump issued executive orders in the four policy areas that had been expected. The extra $400 unemployment payment is likely to last only a month, however. The payroll tax deferment would last through year-end, but consumers might be hesitant to spend extra income without a change in tax law,\u201d Goldman Sachs economists Alec Phillips and Blake Taylor wrote in a note Sunday.The new executive orders could, however, add pressure on Congress to come together to roll out a more comprehensive fiscal package, they added. Already late last week, Democratic lawmakers pared back the size of their proposal to and offered a plan totaling about $2 trillion, from the about $3.5 trillion they had called for earlier this year, and in doing so narrowed the fissure between their and Republican lawmakers\u2019 $1 trillion proposal. The Trump administration struck down the offer, however, and no firm timeline for further stimulus talks among lawmakers has been set.Story continues\u201cWe continue to expect a package worth around $1.5 trillion to become law in August,\u201d the Goldman Sachs economists said. \u201cThe new executive orders create two deadlines around the end of the month, which could provide a new incentive for Congress to act.\u201dOther economists, however, took the opposite stance, and suggested the roll-out of the orders could disincentivize further progress from Congress.\u201cThe executive orders could reduce the urgency for Congress and the White House to get a more comprehensive deal done. If this is all we get for fiscal policy for the rest of the year it would represent a significant downside risk to our growth outlook,\u201d JPMorgan economists led by Michael Feroli said in a note Monday afternoon. \u201cThese executive orders likely will provide stimulus of less than $100 billion, while we have been expecting Congress to add at least $1.0-1.5 trillion of spending once an agreement is reached. We continue to believe that Congress will get a deal done, but we see the path toward that deal complicated by the weekend\u2019s developments.\u201dElsewhere, earnings season continues later on Monday, with Novavax (NVAX), IAC/InteractiveCorp (IAC), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), J2Global (JCOM) and ZoomInfo Technologies (ZI) set to report quarterly results after market close.\u20144:02 p.m. ET: Stocks close mixed as tech shares decline, S&P 500 rises for seventh straight sessionHere were the main moves in markets as of 4:02 p.m. ET:S&P 500 (^GSPC): 3,351.28 to Previous CloseDow (^DJI): +359.40 (+1.31%) to 27,792.88Nasdaq (^IXIC): -42.63 (-0.39%) to 10,968.36Crude (CL=F): +$0.78 (+1.89%) to $42.00 a barrelGold (GC=F): +$6.80 (+0.34%) to $2,034.80 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): +1.2 bps to yield 0.5740%\u20141:58 p.m. ET: Q2 earnings are coming in much better than feared \u2013 and now analysts are raising estimates for FY2020With second-quarter earnings results beginning to wind down, analysts have turned their attention to the current quarter and unleashed a sweep of upward revisions. This came as second-quarter results mostly cleared a low bar of expectations: According to FactSet, 83% of S&P 500 companies that had reported results as of last Friday beat expectations, or the highest proportion since FactSet began keeping records of these metrics in 2008.\u201cBottom-up consensus forecasts currently call for $129 and $165 of EPS [earnings per share] in 2020-21, up from June 30 estimates of $124 and $162, an improvement of 4.3% and 1.6%, respectively,\u201d Credit Suisse analyst Jonathan Golub wrote in a note Monday. \u201c3Q-4Q estimates have risen by 2.6% and 0.1%.\u201dEstimates for fiscal 2020 have improved the most for companies in the discretionary and health-care sectors, Golub added, and the last for industrials, utilities and REITs.Moreover, DataTrek co-founder Nicholas Colas pointed out in a note Monday morning that 2020 EPS estimates have room for still-further upward revisions, with analysts having applied the bulk of upward revisions to the third-quarter this year.\u201cWall Street analysts dramatically underestimated earnings leverage in Q2 and are being very cautious in revising their estimates for the rest of 2020, all of which points to further upside revisions to come,\u201d Colas said.\u201411:36 a.m. ET: S&P 500, Nasdaq turn negative as tech shares fall; Dow holds higherThe S&P 500 and Nasdaq each turned negative late Monday morning as declines in tech shares weighed on the indices.

Meanwhile, the quits rate rose to 1.9% in June, rising further from the April low of 1.3%, but coming in well below the recent high of 2.9% in August 2018.
