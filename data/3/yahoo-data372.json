To coordinate some payment plan for debtor countries, the World Bank has worked with its sister organization, the International Monetary Fund, in convening a group of creditor nations known as the Paris Club.But China is not part of that club, raising questions over how to engage one of the world\u2019s largest creditors. Malpass said the World Bank has been taking on a country-by-country approach to ensuring a moratorium on debt repayment, which he hopes will be extended through 2021.Malpass acknowledged that the web of sovereign debt ownership among countries creates \u201cpolitical leverage,\u201d adding that other types of debt arrangements exist outside of government-issued bonds. For example, the Mongolian central bank has a formal currency swap agreement with the People\u2019s Bank of China allowing Mongolia to borrow renminbi - with interest paid to the PBOC.\u201cTransparency is very important in this because then people can look at it and understand what's going on: interest being paid from Mongolia to China on debt that's held by the central banks,\u201d Malpass said.Malpass said he does not worry about political leverage in the relationship between the U.S. and China. Tensions have escalated between the two world powers, as TikTok and WeChat bans now threaten to complicate an already-heated discussion on trade.World Bank President David Malpass speaks during a press conference for the the Fourth 1+6 Roundtable Dialogue at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, Thursday, Nov. 21, 2019. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)Although Republicans on Capitol Hill have floated the idea of cancelling U.S. debt due to China, Malpass said the two countries have a \u201cstrong\u201d financing relationship and waved off concerns about either side weaponizing sovereign debt holdings.Story continues\u201cThat part of the system is very stable,\u201d Malpass said.Reducing the debt stockIn the meantime, Malpass is advocating for debtor nations to reduce their debt stock. Even though low interest rates are making an attractive case for borrowing, Malpass said soaring debt will only repel potential investors.Malpass added that managing the debt stock will be difficult in a COVID-19 crisis relying on fiscal support to keep households and businesses whole.\u201cThat's been the trade-off that we've wanted to emphasize to the G20 and to the commercial creditors as well: that if they take payment from the poorest countries, that means less money in the country for food for children,\u201d Malpass said. \u201cIt really is that dramatic.\u201dMalpass said the World Bank is still working on efforts to reduce or even wipe off debt among the poorest countries. Part of that effort involves commercial creditors, who played a large role in the Euro Area\u2019s prior debt crises.Malpass said the G20 has engaged banks and other private-sector creditors as part of the debt negotiation process as well.Brian Cheung is a reporter covering the Fed, economics, and banking for Yahoo Finance.
