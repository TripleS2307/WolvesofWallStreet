Specifically, Alphabet\u2019s Google (GOOG) as the largest advertising platform; Apple\u2019s (AAPL) iMessage as the most popular messaging service in the U.S.; Alphabet\u2019s YouTube as the fastest growing platform for video; and Amazon (AMZN) as the largest online retailer, all represent competitive threats.\u201cFor every dollar spent on advertising in the U.S.,\u201d Zuckerberg said, \u201cless than 10 cents is spent with us.\u201d\u2018Weaponizing\u2019 its platformStill, lawmakers were not convinced that Facebook\u2019s dealings with potential competitors have remained above board enough to withstand antitrust scrutiny.The majority of anticompetitive allegations focused on Facebook\u2019s acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp aided its growth to share 20% of a duopoly with Google in the digital advertising industry.Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) accused Facebook of using its power to threaten rivals with cloning their products and with acquiring their companies, including Instagram founder Kevin Systrom and Snapchat (SNAP) founder Evan Spiegel.Story continuesJayapal pointed to communications between Facebook and Systrom, obtained by the subcommittee, that preceded Facebook\u2019s 2012 acquisition of Instagram. The exchange showed the social network communicated to Systrom that it was developing its \u201cown photo strategy,\u201d and that Instagram\u2019s engagement with Facebook would determine the extent to which the companies would operate as future partners versus competitors.Zuckerberg disagreed with the characterization of the correspondence as a threat, saying that at the time, the relationship between Facebook and Instagram was well documented. It was clear that the photo sharing space was one in which Facebook was going to compete \u201cin one way or another,\u201d the CEO said.He added that at time of the acquisition it was not clear that the platform would succeed, and that the Federal Trade Commission did not object to the acquisition.Rep. Joseph Neguse (D-CO) accused Facebook of becoming a monopoly by the time it acquired Instagram, and of compounding its dominance with its subsequent WhatsApp purchase in 2014. Zuckerberg argued alternatively that the acquisition introduced competition against telecommunications companies, by dropping text message charges from 10 cents per text to private messages for free.Along with Neguse, Rep. Matthew Gaetz (R-FL) questioned Zuckerberg about a 2014 message from Facebook CFO David Wehner that referenced the company\u2019s mergers and acquisitions strategy as one of \u201cland grabs,\u201d and a 2012 message from Zuckerberg stating that \u201cone thing about startups though is you can often acquire them.\u201dRep. Valdez Demings (D-FL) accused Facebook of \u201cweaponizing\u201d its policies to restrict competitors including Pinterest from accessing its main platform. Zuckerberg acknowledged Pinterest as a social competitor, stating that at the time in 2012, the company did have a policy to restrict competitors\u2019 use.Lawmakers also questioned Facebook\u2019s purchase of Onavo, which permitted the company to view the extent to which consumers were using WhatsApp before it bought the popular messaging app, and the company\u2019s alleged actions to dismantle its programming interface or Application Programming Interface (API) in response to competitive threats.Against the broad scope of questioning, Zuckerberg and the other tech leaders made it obvious in their prepared statements that they were conscious about U.S.-China tensions, and the role that antitrust plays in their ability to compete with the country\u2019s technology, and on a global scale.\u201cCompanies are created all the time all over the world, and history shows that if we don't keep innovating someone will replace every company here today,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\u201cThat change can often happen faster than you expect. Of the 10 most valuable companies a decade ago, only 3 still make that list today. If you look at where the top technology companies coming from the vast majority were American today. Almost half are Chinese,\u201d he added.Alexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.
