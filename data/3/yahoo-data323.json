An identical number of those surveyed by UBS plan to adjust their portfolios based on the winner.UBS\u2019s data echoed findings by Deutsche Bank, which in July said market participants have grown \u201ccontinuously...more bearish\u201d on Trump\u2019s reelection prospects since the pandemic took hold in March, and underscore how sentiment among investors has now shifted decisively toward his opponent.\u201cThe surge in coronavirus infections in battleground states has placed him at a severe disadvantage as he prepares for his party\u2019s national convention,\u201d according to Solita Marcelli, UBS\u2019 chief investment officer for the Americas. However, she cautioned against going \u201call in\u201d on a pro-Biden investment strategy.\u201cIt\u2019s still too early to conclude with certainty that we will see a transition of power in November. Modern U.S. presidents have successfully exploited the benefits of incumbency in their reelection bids with remarkable frequency,\u201d Marcelli added.US Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden speaks about on the third plank of his Build Back Better economic recovery plan for working families, on July 21, 2020, in New Castle, Delaware.

In fact, Biden\u2019s estimated chances of winning in November are 63% on Smarkets \u2014 topping Trump\u2019s previous high of 61% on Smarkets.\"We\u2019ve never seen a sitting president seeking re-election drop as low as 34%, so Trump seemingly has a huge hill to climb if he is to secure four more years in the White House,\u201d Sarbjit Bakhshi, Smarkets Head of Political Markets, said in a statement on Tuesday.Currently, markets view the prospects of a Biden win with a studied degree of equanimity, and observers have suggested investors can live with him given his comparatively moderate policy stances.However, odds of a Democratic sweep of Washington are on the rise \u2014 along with the potential for big policy shifts that would mean higher taxes, according to UBS\u2019 Marcelli, who outlined differences in the two candidates\u2019 competing visions for the U.S.\u201cIn terms of fiscal policy, President Trump is likely to seek lower taxes in a second term, or to make permanent certain provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that are scheduled to expire in December 2025,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHe would be more likely to ease the financial burden on corporations in order to stimulate economic growth.\u201dBy contrast, Biden \u201cis more inclined to raise corporate tax rates, while prioritizing broad-based spending initiatives around the expansion of healthcare coverage, boosting minimum wages, and providing more federal support for housing and education,\u201d she added.Noting that higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy are integral to progressive Democratic policy, Datatrek\u2019s Nick Colas said on Wednesday the effects from those would likely be offset by massive fiscal support.\u201cEven if their tax rates go back to pre-2017 levels, a longer tail for enhanced unemployment benefits means higher pretax income than if these benefits were to run out sooner,\u201d Colas wrote.\u201cBottom line: at this point in the cycle (depressed, and with high uncertainty), equity holders may actually welcome economic policy that boosts the next 4-6 quarters of revenues even if it comes with a higher marginal tax rate,\u201d he added.-Find live stock market quotes and the latest business and finance newsFor tutorials and information on investing and trading stocks, check out CashayFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and reddit."}]}
