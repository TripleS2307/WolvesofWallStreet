(Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)\u2018It just seemed like it's designed to fail\u2019One is a tale of success through sheer will, while the other is a tale of disappointment.\u201cIt was about the most confusing thing I've ever seen in my life, and I'm just being honest,\u201d Ami Sandler, a California-based teacher, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cIt was the most tedious, most complicated thing I've ever seen.\u201dGloria Nolan, who works at a nonprofit in Missouri, echoed the same sentiment. \u201cIt's been a very tedious process,\u201d she told Yahoo Finance. \u201cBut I told you I was feisty. And I continue to continue to push and continue to try to seek the necessary answers.\u201dWhile both Nolan and Sandler had their original forgiveness applications rejected, Sandler ultimately ended up having $16,000 of his student loans discharged through a different public service forgiveness program after struggling with PSLF. Nolan, who still has $58,000 in student debt, is currently one of the plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed by the American Federation of Teachers (AFT).\u201cIt just seemed like it's designed to fail,\u201d Sandler said of the PSLF program. \u201cHonestly, it is. I feel like the system was designed to fail.\u201dThree men look through the window of the State Capitol building as teachers from across the state of North Carolina march and protest in Raleigh the state capital on May, 16 2018. (Photo: LOGAN CYRUS/AFP via Getty Images)As of April this year, approximately 150,000 borrowers applied for PSLF, the original program. Roughly 1.7% of applications were approved. The average discharged amount was $66,000.Story continuesA big part of why so many applications were thrown out: The borrower had not made enough qualifying payments monthly \u2014 all 120 of them \u2014 or had missing information in their paperwork. Or, their loans weren\u2019t actually eligible in the first place.When Nolan found out about the program in 2008, she said she was told by her then-loan servicer that she \u201cshouldn\u2019t even be having this conversation\u201d since she had to first make 120 payments to qualify for that program. Once she completed that, she recalled, the servicer promised to set up the loans forgiveness.More context on this data\u2013 about 80% of Direct Loan borrowers applicants were not eligible for PSLF because they didn\u2019t have a loan that entered repayment <10 years ago. These borrowers can re-apply for PSLF at a later date: https://t.co/sN15B9DcpA (1/2)\u2014 Federal Student Aid (@FAFSA) December 27, 2019Nolan began making those payments but found out after six years that she had been on the wrong payment plan and those payments wouldn\u2019t count. She finally figured out the paperwork and worked with the servicer to enroll in the right payment plan and started all over again.Nevertheless, her application was denied. Nolan then learned about Temporary Expanded Public Service Loan Forgiveness (TEPSLF) \u2014 a congressionally-mandated expansion of PSLF that reduced some of the barriers \u2014 and applied for that.Nolan's application was denied by the TEPSLF as well. And she isn\u2019t alone: March 2020 data from ED revealed that 29,728 requests were made for TEPSLF and around 6% of requests were approved. The average balance discharged was $42,943.Frustrated, Nolan decided to join the ATF lawsuit to compel ED to fix the system.(Graphic: David Foster)\u2018I felt betrayed\u2019Sandler went through a similar process. After finding out about PSLF and believing he qualified for forgiveness on his $53,000 in student debt, he formally applied for forgiveness in 2017 after ten years of making payments.\u201cYou had to fill out paperwork to verify your employment \u2014 seemed pretty easy. You had to verify paperwork that showed that you still have loans \u2014 pretty simple,\u201d Sandler recalled. \u201cBut then afterwards, after I had sent through the actual PSLF application for the first time, they emailed me back and said, \u2018Oh, you sent us the wrong form. You\u2019ll have to start over again.\u2019\u201dHe had apparently sent the wrong form for workplace verification, while the correct one from the federal government\u2019s website was \u201cno joke... 95% identical.\u201d\u201cIt was about one sentence difference \u2014 about 10 words \u2014 in the new form,\u201d Sandler said.When he finally filed his application, he continued, ED rejected it because he was technically on the wrong payment plan for more than a decade.\u201cI felt betrayed,\u201d Sandler said. \u201cI thought, wow, that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.\u201dOccupy Wall Street demonstrators protest against the rising national student debt in Union Square, in New York, April 25, 2012. (Photo: REUTERS/Andrew Burton)Sandler eventually found out about TEPSLF and applied for that since it only required 10 years of payments on any payment plan and 10 years of service.So, he switched to another income-contingent payment plan and made a few more \u2014 and bigger \u2014 monthly payments (about $500 more) for 12 months and eventually saw his loans erased.\u201cAll of your federal student loans serviced by FedLoan Servicing have been forgiven under the TEPSLF opportunity,\u201d the email from FedLoan stated. \u201cYou no longer have a remaining balance with FedLoan Servicing.\u201dWhen he read the email, \u201cI felt like I just lost 30 pounds, easy,\u201d Sandler said. \u201cIt was just crazy and it felt so good .... it was $16,000.\u201dHe stressed that the fine print was worth reading if people really wanted to get their applications approved.\u201cThat's probably why 99% of people that are getting denied, because they don't know that they have to switch to an income-based plan because it's probably like the smallest font on the website about what you need to do,\u201d Sandler said.\u2018If the government wanted to help teachers...\u2019In early 2020, amid lawsuits against the department and lawmakers decrying that 99% rejection rate, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos agreed to simplify part of the paperwork process.At last! @usedgov announces a streamlined Public Service Loan Forgiveness & TEPSLF certification AND application form, combining many separate steps into one, as @SenateDems have requested for years. #PSLF https://t.co/Vo4Vluh4Ey pic.twitter.com/82VTjgpAcZ\u2014 Bryce McKibben (@bmckib) January 30, 2020Before that announcement, the Trump administration had been headed the opposite direction: In his FY21 budget proposal, he stated his intention to sunset the PSLF program to save an estimated $1.9 billion over the course of the year.In May, Democratic senators introduced a bill to amend the Higher Education Act and revamp the PSLF program to ease some of the convoluted rules that ED claimed was the cause of the high rejection rate.The legislation offers a tiered forgiveness program. So instead of making 120 payments over 10 years, borrowers would get 15% of their balance forgiven after 2 years, another 15% of the balance after 4 years, and the entire balance after 10 years.For public servants making untold sacrifices, what better way to say thanks than expanding opportunities to alleviate the weight of student debt.

Here's something you could possibly qualify for 10 years from now.\u2019 And I would have done that 100%. I would have done that back then.\u201d\u2014Aarthi Swaminathan and Reggie Wade are reporters for Yahoo Finance.Aarthi can be reached at aarthi@yahoofinance.com and rwade@verizonmedia.com.
