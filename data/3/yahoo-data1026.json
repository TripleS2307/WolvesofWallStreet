Pharmaceutical collaborations for certain diseases has been a typical strategy, but the market for those are a fraction of the nearly 8 billion global population.Roche has been one of the leaders in COVID-19 diagnostics with its high-volume testing machines. Roche previously tested a drug, Actemra, to treat COVID-19 \u2014 but ended the clinical trials when the drug didn\u2019t meet its primary endpoint in July.The increasingly urgent search for effective coronavirus treatments and a vaccine comes as the pandemic continues to strengthen its hold on the global economy. The case count globally has surpassed 22 million, with more than 781,000 dead. The U.S. \u2014 a worldwide epicenter of the outbreak \u2014 accounts for nearly 5.5 million cases and 171,000 dead.However, in the U.S. the virus\u2019 surge has waned in the hard-hit Sun Belt states, even as concerns widen about a second wave in the fall amid an increasingly difficult path to reopening schools and universities. Meanwhile, New York City, a former COVID-19 hotspot, reported on Wednesday that its infection rate had tumbled to the lowest level since the crisis began \u2014 a milestone in the city\u2019s hard-fought return to normal.Cases in the south are beginning to subside.
