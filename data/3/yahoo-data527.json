Zuckerberg even went as far as learning Mandarin, but the company was ultimately rebuffed.Amazon\u2019s inability to outsourceBezos, like Zuckerberg, stuck to how much Amazon has invested in the U.S. economy via jobs and the impact Amazon\u2019s service has had on small and medium businesses that use the company\u2019s ecommerce platform to reach customers.\u201cWhen customers shop on Amazon, they are helping to create jobs in their local communities,\u201d Bezos said.\u201cAs a result, Amazon directly employs a million people, many of them entry-level and paid by the hour. We don\u2019t just employ highly educated computer scientists and MBAs in Seattle and Silicon Valley. We hire and train hundreds of thousands of people in states across the country, such as West Virginia, Tennessee, Kansas, and Idaho.\u201dIn his remarks, Bezos explained that many of those jobs require employees to be located close to customers, meaning they can\u2019t be outsourced to China. He also explained how the U.S. offers a unique opportunity for companies like Amazon to grow.\u201cIt\u2019s not a coincidence that Amazon was born in this country,\u201d Bezos said. \u201cMore than any other place on Earth, new companies can start, grow, and thrive here in the U.S. Our country embraces resourcefulness and self-reliance, and it embraces builders who start from scratch.\u201dAmazon does, however, do business at a global scale and, despite mentioning an inability to outsource jobs to China, the company offers a number of its services in the country including its power Amazon Web Services platform.Google\u2019s fight as America\u2019s fightAlphabet\u2019s Pichai, for his part, linked the success of Silicon Valley tech companies directly to America\u2019s continued leadership in the technology industry. In his statement, Pichai pointed to the massive investment Alphabet has made in the U.S. and how that has benefited the country at large.According to the CEO, Google makes deep investments in America\u2019s future in technology.\u201cThrough these investments, our teams of engineers are helping America solidify its position as the global leader in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, and quantum computing,\u201d Pichai saidHe followed that statement by playing on fears that the U.S. isn\u2019t guaranteed to hold on to its position as a global leader in tech, saying, \u201cJust as American leadership in these areas is not inevitable, we know Google\u2019s continued success is not guaranteed.\u201dPichai also explained how the company employs 75,000 people in 26 states, and that the company was the largest capital investor in the U.S. in 2018 and has been among the top 5 investors in the country for the last three years.Apple\u2019s story is AmericanApple is somewhat of an afterthought in the tech antitrust hearing largely because its issues stem from its own App Store rather than complete dominance of the internet, social media, or ecommerce in general.Still, Cook made sure to mention that Apple\u2019s story is an American one.\u201cApple is a uniquely American company whose success is only possible in this country,\u201d he said.\u201cMotivated by the mission to put things into the world that enrich people\u2019s lives, and believing deeply that the way we do that is by making the best not the most, Apple has produced many revolutionary products, not least of which is the iPhone.\u201dCook also mentioned the economic impact the App Store has had on Americans in particular, saying that the store, which has 1.7 million apps, has generated 1.9 million jobs in 50 states.How these companies are eventually held to account for their alleged monopolistic behavior remains to be seen. But the hearing will provide at least an idea as to how lawmakers are leaning.Got a tip?
