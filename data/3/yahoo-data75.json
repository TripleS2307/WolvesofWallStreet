McConnell has called it his \u201cred line.\u201d\u201cAlmost anybody could become liable for almost anything \u2013 and there are enterprising trial lawyers all over the country, waiting to take advantage of it,\u201d McConnell said on July 28.The HEALS Act \u2013 the Senate Republican plan for the next round of relief \u2013 includes five years of legal protections for businesses, hospitals, schools, colleges and nonprofits that make \u201creasonable efforts\u201d to follow health and safety guidelines.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of Calif., center, accompanied by Senate Minority Leader Sen.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)\u201cIn this national emergency, during this pandemic and during the time when our economy needs to safely reopen, liability protections are important for everybody,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) when Republicans unveiled the HEALS Act.\u2018They betrayed workers\u2019 Democratic lawmakers say the Republican proposal doesn\u2019t consider workers who may be put in harm\u2019s way while on the job.\u201cThey [Republicans] tell them to go to work: \u2018Go to work, you\u2019re an essential worker, you must go to work. And when you go to work and have no protections, you have no recourse,\u201d said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) at a press conference last month.\u201cThey choose corporate interests over workers,\u201d said Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) in an interview with Yahoo Finance. \u201cAgain, they betrayed workers.\u201dBusiness groups argue liability protections will help put the economy back on track. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and nearly 500 organizations recently wrote Congressional leaders a letter, urging them to include liability protections in the next coronavirus bill, \u201cso they can continue to contribute to a safe and effective economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201dStory continues\u201cCOVID-19-related lawsuits and their consequent exorbitant legal costs could deter entities from reopening and could ultimately cripple businesses, educational institutions, and non-profit organizations both large and small,\u201d the letter goes on to say.School districts, colleges and Republican governors have also pressed Congress to put some form of lawsuit protections in place, while professional athletes\u2019 unions have come out against a liability shield.\u201cIt is top of mind for not just businesses, but really a whole host of entities across our country,\u201d Neil Bradley, executive vice president and chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, told Yahoo Finance in an interview. \u201cEmployers across the country face a lot of uncertainty \u2014 the COVID crisis, the economic uncertainty \u2014 liability uncertainty adds to that confusion for employers.\u201dBrown warned a liability shield could have serious consequences.Executive Chef Willie Brockington, left, and line chef Saul Sibri, work in the kitchen at Stokesay Castle in Lower Alsace Township, PA Thursday evening August 6, 2020 where they have made renovations to the Knight's Pub, the banquet room, the kitchen, and added a martini bar.

They want to be able to do nothing and still have total protection,\u201d said Trumka.AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka listens at the National Press Club in Washington, Tuesday, April 4, 2017. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\u201cWhen corporations do what's required of them and follow the law on the environment on worker safety standards, they don't get sued,\u201d said Brown. \u201cI mean good lawyers don't bring lawsuits against corporations that behave and follow the law.\u201dBradley told Yahoo Finance more guidance would be helpful for the business community, but going through OSHA isn\u2019t the way to do it.\u201cOur understanding of this disease is constantly evolving and understanding what we need to do to prevent its spread is constantly evolving...we welcome federal guidelines,\u201d said Bradley. \u201cBut it probably shouldn't take the form of traditional OSHA style, hundreds of pages of regulations, because those types of things don't have the flexibility to adjust as our understanding of the spread of this disease adjusts.\u201dAn avalanche of lawsuits? McConnell and other Republicans have warned that an \u201cepidemic\u201d of lawsuits could follow the pandemic \u2013 but so far, that hasn\u2019t been the case. Less than one-third of Americans say they would sue over coronavirus exposure, according to a Yahoo Finance-Harris Poll.According to Hunton Andrew Kurth\u2019s COVID-19 litigation tracker, roughly 4,200 coronavirus-related legal complaints have been made so far. Most of the filings deal with insurance claims, prisoner petitions or civil rights (including challenging stay-at-home orders). Few complaints are related to COVID-19 exposure or wrongful death.In mid-July, the American Association for Justice \u2014 which represents plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers \u2014 analyzed the database and found personal injury cases made up less than 5% of the total COVID-related complaints. Supporters of the liability protections argue it\u2019s better for Congress to take action now and be proactive.\u201cI don't think we should wait to erect a safe harbor until after we already have thousands and thousands of lawsuits. That denies the very protection that small businesses and universities and public schools are looking for here. We're trying to get in front of this problem,\u201d said Bradley. \u201cWe should erect these safe harbors now, not wait until we're dealing with the avalanche of lawsuits.\u201dJessica Smith is a reporter for Yahoo Finance based in Washington, D.C.
