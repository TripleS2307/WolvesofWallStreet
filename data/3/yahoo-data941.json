Meanwhile, Target (TGT) and Lowe\u2019s (LOW) each reported second-quarter results before market open that handily topped consensus expectations, as consumers turned to each retailer in droves during the pandemic and as stay-in-place orders were in effect.The S&P 500\u2019s most recent leg higher brought its total gain from its March lows to 52%. And in taking out its previous record closing high, the S&P 500 ended the shortest-ever recorded bear market, or period following a stock market drop of 20% peak to trough.The advance came as shares of big tech stocks rallied yet again, with Amazon (AMZN) shares rising 4% to its own record close Tuesday after the company announced plans to add thousands more jobs to major hubs across the country. The rise in tech names \u2013 and in the Nasdaq Composite, which rallied to yet another record high on Tuesday as well \u2013 reflected the trend of the past several months in equity markets, as investors piled heavily into software and tech names as a defensive play against the pandemic and stay-in-place orders.Still, the market\u2019s rally to new highs comes as millions of American remain unemployed at the hands of the coronavirus pandemic, and as the prospects for another fiscal stimulus package hang in balance.But as many analysts have noted, the market has been discounting the future rather than the present, with a plethora of new data coming in better-than-feared and on an improving trajectory relative to trends seen earlier this spring. Virus growth rates have begun to slow even in recent epicenters in the South and West. And data on the housing market, retail sales and manufacturing activity have shown pockets of the economy that have at least begun to recuperate some of the damage done during the height of stay-in-place orders.Story continues\u201cMany people believe that the market isn\u2019t accurately reflecting the severity of the underlying health and economic crisis \u2013 that\u2019s because the market is focused on the future versus what\u2019s happening in real-time,\u201d Peter Giacchi, head of designated market maker floor trading for Citadel Securities, said in an email.\u201cThe reason we saw real-time record lows at the beginning of the pandemic was because of the uncertainty surrounding the virus,\u201d he added. \u201cNow that investors, to a certain degree, have a handle on the situation, the moves have become more forward-looking, more optimistic and the market is behaving as it historically has to date.\u201d\u20144:02 p.m. ET: Stocks close slightly lower; Target surges 12.7% after reporting blowout earningsHere were the main moves in markets as of 4:02 p.m. ET:S&P 500 (^GSPC): -14.87 points (-0.44%) to 3,374.91Dow (^DJI): -85.12 points (-0.31%) to 27,692.95Nasdaq (^IXIC): -64.38 points (-0.57%) to 11,146.46Crude (CL=F): -$0.10 (-0.23%) to $42.79 a barrelGold (GC=F): -$67.30 (-3.34%) to $1,945.80 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): +0.6 bps to yield 0.6750%\u20142:05 p.m. ET: FOMC sees pandemic \u2018posing considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term\u2019The Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s minutes from its July meeting reflected US central bankers\u2019 view that consumer spending trends were improving off early-spring lows, but that overall economic activity remained pressured by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\u201cMembers agreed that the ongoing public health crisis would weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and was posing considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term,\u201d according to the FOMC minutes. \u201cIn light of these developments, members decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to \u00bc percent. Members stated that they expected to maintain this target range until they were confident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve the Committee\u2019s maximum employment and price stability goals.\u201d\u201cIn contrast to the sizable rebound in consumer spending, participants saw less improvement in the business sector in recent months, and they noted that their District business contacts continued to report extraordinarily high levels of uncertainty and risks,\u201d the minutes added.\u201412:50 p.m. ET: Stocks hold onto narrow gainsThe three major indices were each slightly higher Wednesday afternoon, steadying around record levels. The tech-heavy communication services sector led gains in the S&P 500, followed by industrials and financials. A more than 2% gain in shares of Nike led the advance in the Dow, though a more than 1% drop in shares of Walmart weighed to the downside.Here were the main moves in equity markets as of 12:50 p.m. ET:S&P 500 (^GSPC): +4.86 points (+0.14%) to 3,394.64Dow (^DJI): +39.71 points (+0.14%) to 27,817.78Nasdaq (^IXIC): +28.02 points (+0.25%) to 11,239.00\u201410:50 a.m. ET: Apple\u2019s market capitalization tops $2 trillion for the first time everApple (AAPL) shares climbed more than 1% intraday Wednesday to more than $467.77 per share, bringing its market capitalization above the $2 trillion mark, based on shares outstanding as listed in public filings.This made Apple the first US company ever to hit the $2 trillion level for market capitalization.

Sales were driven by \u201ca consumer focus on the home, core repair and maintenance activities, and wallet share shift away from other discretionary spending,\u201d CEO Marvin Ellison said in a statement. Sales momentum is continuing into August, he added.Overall, Lowe\u2019s second-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $3.75 were better than the $2.90 expected, and revenue of $27.3 billion topped estimates for $24.15 billion.\u20147:30 a.m. ET: Stock futures point to a mostly higher open after strong set of earningsHere were the main moves in markets, as of 7:30 a.m. ET:S&P 500 futures (ES=F): 3,391.5.00, up 4.5 points or 0.13%Dow futures (YM=F): 27,766.00, up 49 points, or 0.18%Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): 11,409.00, flatCrude (CL=F): -$0.33 (-0.77%) to $42.56 a barrelGold (GC=F): -18.70 (-0.93%) to $1,994.40 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): -2 bps to yield 0.649%\u20147:25 a.m. ET: Target reports record comp sales growth as digital sales surgeTarget (TGT) posted second-quarter results that shocked to the upside, as the company saw \u201cunusually strong market-share gains\u201d across all of its core categories, as consumers flocked to the big-box retailer online especially during the pandemic.Target\u2019s comparable same-store sales rose by a record 24.3%, or nearly three times the 8.6% growth rate expected. Digital sales were a strong point, climbing 195% to comprise 13.4 percentage points of the headline comp sales growth.Every major category grew sales in the second quarter, including apparel, which swung from a 20% sales decline in the first quarter to double digit growth in the second. Home goods sales grew 30%, electronics jumped 70%, beauty rose 20%, food/beverage increased 20% and essentials sales climbed 20%.\u20147:00 a.m. ET Wednesday: Mortgage applications fell last week as refinances softened, but purchases continued to climbAn index tracking mortgage applications for home purchases and refinances fell last week, unwinding some recent gains as housing market activity picked up across the country.The Mortgage Bankers\u2019 Association Market Composite Index, which tracks mortgage loan application volume, fell 3.3% on a seasonally adjusted basis for the week ended August 14, following a 6.8% climb during the previous week. The drawdown was driven by a 5% decline in refinances week-over-week, although the level of refinances remained 38% higher than the same week a year ago. Applications for purchases rose 1% week over week.\u201cPositive economic data reported last week on retail sales, as well as a large US Treasury auction, drove mortgage rates to their highest level in two weeks. The rise in rates dampened refinance activity, but purchase applications continued their strong run and were 27% higher than a year ago \u2013 the third straight month of year-over-year increases,\u201d Joel Kan, MBA\u2019s associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting, said in a statement.\u201cThe housing market remains a bright spot in the current economic recovery and these results, combined with July data on housing starts and homebuilder optimism, suggest that housing supply could be increasing to better meet the strong demand for buying a home,\u201d Kan added.\u20146:07 p.m. ET Tuesday: Stock futures open flat after record closesHere were the main moves in equity markets, as of 6:07 p.m. ET:S&P 500 futures (ES=F): 3,387.00, flatDow futures (YM=F): 27,719.00, up 2 points, or 0.01%Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): 11,406.75, down 2.5 points, or 0.02%A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the opening bell in New York, August 18, 2015.
