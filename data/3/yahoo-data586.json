The 20-City Composite posted a 4% annual gain, up from 3.9% in March, also beating Bloomberg estimates of 3.8%. As in March, the 20-City Composite just represented 19 cities because transaction records for Wayne County, Mich. were unavailable.\u201cThe price trend that was in place pre-pandemic seems so far to be undisturbed, at least at the national level,\u201d said Craig J. Lazzara, managing director and global head of index investment strategy at S&P Dow Jones Indices, in a press statement. \"April\u2019s housing price data continue to be remarkably stable. April\u2019s year-over-year gains were ahead of March\u2019s, continuing a trend of gently accelerating home prices that began last fall.

Solis, File)Phoenix for the eleventh straight month led the 20-City Composite, posting an 8.8% annual gain in April, Seattle and Minneapolis followed posting a 7.3% and 6.4% gain, respectively.\u201cEven amid millions of lost jobs, health-related fears and an incredibly uncertain economic outlook, historically low mortgage rates in April helped to buoy the strong buyer demand that had been building in the months preceding the pandemic, fueling competition for the relatively few for-sale homes on the market and driving up prices as a result,\u201d said Zillow economist Matthew Speakman, in a press statement. \u201cThat heightened demand hasn\u2019t wavered in the months since, as inventory continues to fall, mortgage rates keep finding new lows and measures of buyer activity have picked up markedly.\u201dThe price results, while lagging other housing data, come as other data reveal a promising outlook for the housing market. While existing home sales for May fell (for the third consecutive month) as expected given the coronavirus lockdowns, pending home sales in May rebounded sharply, increasing 44.3% from a month earlier \u2014 the largest one-month increase ever recorded by the National Association of Realtors.Story continuesPending home sales unlike existing sales are a leading indicator of the health of the housing market and along with other data, new home sales and construction activity, released earlier this month reveal the market is in recovery mode. New home sales rose 16.6% in May to an annualized pace of 676,000 units, beating analysts\u2019 expectations of 640,000. There are also signs that the luxury housing market is on the mend after coronavirus lockdowns basically halted all activity in May.\u201cThis has been a spectacular recovery for contract signings, and goes to show the resiliency of American consumers and their evergreen desire for homeownership,\u201d said Lawrence Yun, NAR\u2019s chief economist, in a press statement. \u201cThis bounce back also speaks to how the housing sector could lead the way for a broader economic recovery.\u201dAmanda Fung is an editor at Yahoo Finance.Read more:Luxury real estate may be back as the housing market recovers but bewareHome price growth accelerated at the start of 2020 before coronavirus slammed the USEconomist on housing: 'You can't buy what's not for sale'The hottest housing market of 2019Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.Find live stock market quotes and the latest business and finance newsFor tutorials and information on investing and trading stocks, check out Cashay"}]}
