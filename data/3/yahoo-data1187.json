The Conference Board\u2019s Consumer Confidence Index released Tuesday morning unexpectedly fell in August to a six-year low, extending July\u2019s decline after fiscal stimulus to consumers tapered off and a clouded outlook around the pandemic remained. The weakening in consumer confidence bodes negatively for consumer spending, which comprises more than two-thirds of US economic activity.But concurrently on Tuesday, new government data on the housing market showed new home sales jump to the highest level in 14 years and extended July\u2019s double-digit monthly increase, in the latest data sign of a booming recovery in the US housing market.

The results came as consumers increasingly took part in socially distant outdoor activities and exercise, and turned to Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods for equipment, according to CEO Ed Stack in this morning\u2019s earnings release. E-commerce sales jumped 194% in the quarter. Still, the company\u2019s comparable sales slowed to an 11% jump in the first three weeks of the current quarter, with a slower back-to-school season weighing on results.Nordstrom, on the other hand, missed consensus expectations on the top and bottom lines, with net sales down 53% over last year. The company was hit by both store closures and the delay of its annual anniversary sale to August from July due to the pandemic. Nordstrom decreased inventory by more than 25% as a move to mitigate markdowns and pad margins \u2013 however, the company still posted a wider than expected loss in the quarter, with adjusted losses of $1.54 per share.\u20149:33 a.m. ET: Stocks open mixed, S&P 500 and Nasdaq advance to fresh intraday record levelsHere were the main moves in markets as of 9:33 a.m. ET:S&P 500 (^GSPC): +2.45 points (+0.07%) to 3,446.07Dow (^DJI): -44.2 points (-0.16%) to 28,204.24Nasdaq (^IXIC): +42.07 points (+0.37%) to 11,509.78Crude (CL=F): +$0.26 (+0.6%) to $43.61 a barrelGold (GC=F): -$0.40 (-0.02%) to $1,922.70 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): +1.3 bps to yield 0.695%\u20148:30 a.m. ET: Durable goods orders surge in July for a third straight monthDurable goods orders jumped 11.2% in July, according to the Commerce Department\u2019s preliminary monthly report Wednesday morning, coming in at more than double the 4.8% rise consensus economists expected. Durable goods orders in June rose at a 7.7% clip.Excluding transportation orders, July durable goods orders were up 2.4%, topping expectations but slowing from June\u2019s 4.0% rise.\u201cThe sharp rise in durable goods orders last month was flattered by a surge in transport orders, but core orders are nevertheless almost back to the pre-pandemic level, suggesting that the recovery in business equipment investment has been V-shaped,\u201d Michael Pearce, senior US economist for Capital Economics, said in a note Wednesday morning.Non-defense capital goods orders, excluding aircraft, rose 1.9% in July, also slowing from a 4.3% rate in June.
