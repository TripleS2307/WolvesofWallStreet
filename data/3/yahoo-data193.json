According to Postmaster general Louis DeJoy, the agency is in a \u201cdire\u201d financial situation, citing significant falls in mail volume, \u201ca broken business model\u201d and an inadequate management strategy as reasons for the \u201cimpending liquidity crisis.\u201d Dejoy has been implementing changes since assuming the role in June, including organizational restructuring and a management hiring freeze, saying they\u2019re meant to \u201cstrengthen the Postal Service.\u201dBut there appear to be moves that he might have left out. Vice is reporting that the USPS is also retiring mail sorting machines around the country \u201cwithout any official explanation or reason given.\u201d The office of the USPS Inspector General and its media representatives have yet to respond to Engadget\u2019s requests for confirmation.According to internal documents obtained by Vice\u2019s technology site Motherboard, close to 15 percent of the organization\u2019s machines will be taken out of service. That\u2019s a total of 502 machines around the country, and USPS workers Motherboard spoke with said the move would \u201cslow their ability to sort mail.\u201d An earlier report by CNN noted that the agency had begun removing these machines in June, and that it had initially intended to retire 671 machines instead of 502.Motherboard added that the USPS presentation it obtained described this as an \u201cequipment reduction,\u201d rather than \u201cmov[ing] equipment around its network\u201d as a spokesperson had earlier said.As part of the restructuring announced earlier this month, DeJoy said that mail processing operations will report to a newly created Logistics and Processing Operations organization that\u2019s separate from area and district reporting structures. This change was made \u201cto allow for improved focus and clear communication channels,\u201d he wrote. The move has faced public criticism, with Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-VA) calling it \u201csabotage\u201d on Twitter. Connolly chairs the House subcommittee for government operations, which oversees the postal service.Story continuesMore recently, DeJoy reportedly admitted in an internal memo that CNN obtained that the restructuring has led to \u201cunintended consequences that impacted our overall service levels,\u201d but reiterated that the changes were \u201cnecessary.\u201dBefore the pandemic, the USPS had been delivering an estimated 146 billion pieces of mail a year, including 6 billion packages. But with the election looming and people stuck at home, voting by mail has become a topic of national debate and is expected to lead to a surge in volume. President Trump has questioned the post office\u2019s ability to manage the anticipated influx, saying \u201chow can the post office be expected to handle [this]?\u201d He added, \u201cThat\u2019s a tremendous strain on the post office. The post office loses a fortune, it has been for many many years, for decades. So now on top of it it has this.\u201d To be clear, the USPS is not a for-profit business. It\u2019s an independent agency of the federal government\u2019s executive branch that serves the public.DeJoy said in his opening remarks for the USPS board of governors \u201cwhile I certainly have a good relationship with the President of the United States, the notion that I would ever make decisions concerning the Postal Service at the direction of the President, or anyone else in the Administration, is wholly off-base.\u201d He added that \u201cthe Postal Service and I are fully committed to fulfilling our role in the electoral process.\u201d\u201cIf public policy makers choose to utilize the mail as a part of their election system, we will do everything we can to deliver Election Mail in a timely manner consistent with our operational standards,\u201d he wrote. DeJoy also asked for election officials and voters to \u201cbe mindful of the time that it takes for us to deliver ballots.\u201dAs the USPS continues to assess its operations to find ways to serve the public, removing mail sorting machines may lead to increased burdens on postal workers who might have to take on the previously automated task. It\u2019s not clear if these machines might be replaced with newer models, or if the leftover machines are capable of picking up the slack. It\u2019s clear the agency needs financial support to continue running without overworking its employees, especially with an election coming up."}]}
