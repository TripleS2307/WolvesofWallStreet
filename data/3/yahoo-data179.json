The unemployment rate fell to 7.9%.President Trump at the White House on Thursday before confirming announcing he had tested positive for Covid-19 later that night.

The number of permanent job losers jumped by 345,000 to 3.8 million, an increase of 2.5 million since February.As for those jobs, LaVorgna said \"those numbers bounce around a lot,\" adding \"I would take issue with that and say the economy is coming back.\u201d\u201cWe are creating a lot of jobs, a record amount of jobs, and also we've got a lot of new industries that are coming post coronavirus,\" he said, noting that the \u201csuper V\u201d shaped recovery is still on.Other observers are discussing a K-shaped recovery with some people returning to normal but others continuing to struggle.LaVorgna also pointed to the private sector as a reason to be bullish. \"The headline may have been weaker, but keep in mind that the private number was bang on with consensus expectations,\" he said.Government jobs were, indeed, the only category which declined in September, driven by temporary Census 2020 workers ending their duties.Joseph Lavorgna is the Chief Economist of the the National Economic Council. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\u2018We are up over a point\u2019The unemployment rate \u2013 which dropped to 7.9% from 8.4% largely due to 700,000 workers leaving the labor force \u2013 was another aspect of the report LaVorgna highlighted.Answering questions from reporters on Friday morning, White Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said it was a \u201cgreat\u201d jobs report specifically mentioned the unemployment falling below 8%. He also said the president was focused on work even though he was displaying coronavirus symptoms.Story continues\u201cHis first question to me this morning is how is the economy doing, how are the stimulus talks going on Capitol Hill,\u201d Meadows said.LaVorgna added of the president\u2019s positive Covid-19 test, \u201cwe are praying and wishing for a speedy recovery, but we\u2019re working and business goes on.\"Other analysts see a stagnating recovery. Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, noted during an earlier appearance on Yahoo Finance that the economy is entering the fall with \u201cmuch less momentum\u201d than he would have hoped.LaVorgna went deeper into the numbers: \"We are up over a point on participation rate since April,\" he said of the 6-month trend, and also pointed to the U-6 \u2013 the broadest measure of unemployment \u2013 which fell from 14.2% to 12.8%.He pointed to three sectors \u2013 retail trade; leisure and hospitality; and healthcare and social assistance \u2013 noting they \"accounted for two-thirds of the almost 11.5 million available jobs that have been created since April.\" Left unsaid, of course, was that all three sectors remain down from before the virus struck.On the need for more stimulus, LaVorgna says that he and the president would like another stimulus bill to get the economy moving, but either way \"we clearly see in the data a self-feeding, self-sustaining recovery.\"Larry Kudlow, the director of the NEC, made a more direct call on Friday. He said relief is currently \u201czero\u201d and called for at least some stimulus. \u201cLet\u2019s find the key points and pass it,\u201d he told reporters, noting that airlines in particular need help.Ben Werschkul is a producer for Yahoo Finance in Washington, DC.Read more:This is the worst unemployment ever seen before a US presidential electionStock market news live updates: Wall Street reels as Trump contracts Covid-19, jobs data disappointSeptember jobs report: US economy gains 661,000 payrolls, unemployment rate ticks down to 7.9%Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit."}]}
