Financial markets had a V-shape [recovery],\u201d Brusuelas told Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cOn The Move.\u201d\u201cOf course housing is going to be the leader because the Fed sent rates to zero. But if you\u2019re not in those isolated sectors, or really participating in the financial and tech economy, you\u2019re hurting,\u201d he added.On Monday, stocks opened higher on hopes of a stimulus to help individuals deal with the economic fallout of the pandemic and Moderna\u2019s (MRNA) announcement of the start of a phase 3 trial for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate.Nurse Kathe Olmstead prepares a shot as the world's biggest study of a possible COVID-19 vaccine, developed by the National Institutes of Health and Moderna Inc., gets underway Monday, July 27, 2020, in Binghamton, N.Y.
