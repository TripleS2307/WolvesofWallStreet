In the past week alone, more than 83,000 Robinhood accounts added Tesla to their portfolios, according to data from Robintrack. That made Tesla the second-most popular stock on the platform after Moderna (MRNA) during the period.NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JANUARY 30: A Tesla vehicle is displayed in a Manhattan dealership on January 30, 2020 in New York City. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)CatalystsEven with a Neutral rating, Levy said he still expects Tesla \u201cto continue garnering attention with a number of positive catalysts ahead.\u201dOne will be second-quarter earnings results, which are set for release on Wednesday. That report will be closely watched to see whether Tesla manages to eke out a modest profit, based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). To do so would mark Tesla\u2019s fourth straight GAAP profitable quarter and make the electric-car maker eligible for consideration into the S&P 500 \u2013 making shares available to an even wider range of investors.Story continuesOther catalysts include Tesla\u2019s inaugural Battery Day September, which WedBush analyst Dan Ives said in a note earlier this week would will likely include a Tesla announcement for \u201c\u2018game changing\u2019 battery developments.Further expansion on auto-making capacity will also be a key catalyst to watch for Tesla, Credit Suisse\u2019s Levy said.The capacity \u201cpoint is crucial, as over the next 18 months Tesla capacity may nearly double for its current level (currently 700k, going to 1.3mn units),\u201d he said. \u201cIt potentially implies upside to 2022 volume estimates (we forecast ~970k).\u201dLevy\u2019s new price target of $1,400 on shares of Tesla is well above the $881 average price target on the stock among more than 30 analysts on Wall Street, according to Bloomberg data. Baird analyst Ben Kallo also raised his price target on shares of Tesla to $984 from $700 previously, while maintaining a Neutral rating.Shares of Tesla rose 259% for the year to date through Thursday\u2019s close.\u2014Emily McCormick is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.
