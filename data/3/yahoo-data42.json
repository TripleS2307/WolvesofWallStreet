Turns out an increasing number of Americans have recently been turning to purchasing prefabricated, stand-alone office options.For Boulder, Colorado-based Studio Shed, which has been building small offices and bedrooms that cost an average of $20,000 to $30,000 in backyards since 2008, business has been exploding. Studio Shed co-founder Mike Koenig tells Yahoo Finance that the shift to work from home during the pandemic has propelled sales to increase 14-fold over what his company saw last year.Boulder, Colorado-based Studio Shed has seen demand for its prefabricated offices explode due to the shift to work from home during the pandemic.\u201cRecently, we have seen a massive surge in the 80- to 120-square feet option, which is a perfect office size or home gym or kid\u2019s study area,\u201d Koenig said. \u201cWe were already seeing some very good growth having started in 2008 just seeing these shifts in the way people work and wanting to spend more time at home and maybe not commute, but starting in March it\u2019s just been growing significantly.\u201dStudio Shed's stand-alone offices vary in size and cost, but average about $20,000 to $30,000, including foundation and sight work costs.While most of the demand for Studio Shed\u2019s home offices have traditionally come from Western U.S. states, Koenig says the East Coast has been experiencing a spike in demand as more people work from home. In many areas where permits aren\u2019t required for add-on dwellings below 200 square feet, the pop-up office has become an attractive solution to reduce a cramped home feeling as homes double as workspaces.Story continues\u201cAs soon as March and April hit we definitely saw that Eastern part of the country grow, that market is up a couple hundred percent over last year,\u201d he said.For the month of August, a traditionally slow month for sales, Koenig says business is pacing to top last year\u2019s mark by a factor of 14.Zack Guzman is the host of YFi PM as well as a senior writer and on-air reporter covering entrepreneurship, cannabis, startups, and breaking news at Yahoo Finance.
