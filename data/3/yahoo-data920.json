SubscribeRetail sales will offer a final look back at a stimulus-supported recovery.In just a few hours, investors will get the July reading on retail sales.Wall Street expects the report will show sales increased 2.1% last month, a more modest increase after a 7.5% jump in June.June\u2019s retail sales data brought this measure of consumer spending back above levels that prevailed before the pandemic.And in doing so affirmed the strength of the economic comeback in the early part of the summer and the effectiveness of enhanced unemployment benefits and stimulus checks sent out as part of the CARES Act.But over the last few weeks, the economic situation has changed considerably.Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, noted Thursday that the firm\u2019s recovery tracker running through the week of July 31 fell for the fifth time in eight weeks.\u201cThe sugar rush from re-openings has clearly faded,\u201d Klachkin writes.Since July came to a close, workers have been sent off what Deutsche Bank economists call the \u201cbenefits cliff\u201d with no clear path in sight to offering more aid in the months ahead. And with a surge in the virus during July, the labor market stalled and real-time measures of economic activity flatlined.\u201cLast month we argued that rapid and robust fiscal stimulus was a critical driver of the initial V-shaped recovery in consumer spending and therefore that several benefits cliffs could endanger this momentum if government support was removed prematurely,\u201d said Matt Luzzetti, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank.\u201cThe evaporation of these benefits highlights near-term downside risks to consumer spending, particularly for lower income households, which have been a critical engine of the recovery despite being disproportionately more likely to lose a job during the pandemic \u2014 a testament to the effectiveness of the income supplement.\u201dStory continuesLuzzetti adds that while the White House announced it would take executive action last week to reallocate unused dollars from the CARES Act to supplement existing unemployment programs, there remain challenges \u2014 both legal and practical \u2014 to getting this aid into the hands of consumers.And as the following chart from Deutsche Bank shows, monies disbursed through unemployment programs have fallen sharply in August.Since the expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits through the CARES Act, assistance to workers has dropped sharply, posing a downside risk to consumer spending in the months ahead. (Source: Deutsche Bank)In addition to being harmed by this \u201cbenefits cliff\u201d July\u2019s retail sales data should also show the economic recovery entered a softer environment as case counts surged and tailwinds from pent-up demand following April\u2019s lockdown abated.\u201cWe expect key July data next week to highlight a slower phase of the recovery,\u201d said Lewis Alexander, an economist at Nomura. \u201cCore retail sales growth will likely slow materially to a 2.0% m-o-m increase, down from 5.6% in June and 10.1% in May, reflecting softening high-frequency data on consumer debit and credit card spending.\u201dAnd absent any material change in the current discussion about additional stimulus coming from lawmakers in Washington, Friday\u2019s look back at July retail sales data could reflect the best data we get on the health of consumers for some time.\u201cExecutive orders issued by President Trump earlier this week fall short of providing meaningful support to the economy,\u201d Klachkin writes.\u201cThe lack of funding for small businesses, state and local governments, and necessary health measures will minimize chances of a sustained rebound in our tracker. Without a substantial fiscal package, the virus will continue to depress economic activity, and significant downside risks will persist.\u201dBy Myles Udland, reporter and co-anchor of The Final Round.
