As the crisis hastens the shift to low-carbon energy, oil majors are axing jobs, taking multibillion-dollar writedowns and slashing once-sacrosanct dividends.At Shell, 7,000 to 9,000 job losses are expected by the end of 2022 -- as much as 11% of the workforce. The total includes around 1,500 people taking voluntary redundancy this year, the company said Wednesday. It predicts sustainable annual cost savings of $2 billion to $2.5 billion by that time.\u201cWe have to be a simpler, more streamlined, more competitive organization,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden said in a statement. \u201cIn many places, we have too many layers in the company: too many levels between me, as the CEO, and the operators and technicians at our locations.\u201dShell plans to \u201crefocus\u201d its refining business, eventually reducing its number of plants to fewer than 10, from the 15 it\u2019s involved in today. Refining margins have been much lower this quarter than last quarter, and oil-product sales have shrunk to around 4 million to 5 million barrels a day from 6.7 million a year earlier, according to the statement.While the Anglo-Dutch major didn\u2019t provide a full breakdown of the job losses, a spokesperson said that positions in the top three layers of the company would be reduced by one fifth.Third-quarter oil-product trading results will fall short of the historical average and will be \u201csignificantly lower\u201d than in the second quarter, the company said. That shows the trading bonanza that saved Shell\u2019s last set of results won\u2019t be repeated. Its full third-quarter financials, scheduled for Oct. 29, will include impairment charges of $1 billion to $1.5 billion.Story continuesShell\u2019s B shares traded down 1.7% at 940.2 pence as of 4:36 p.m. local time.Right Path\u201cThe transformation to a leaner and lower-carbon organization is the right one for Shell longer-term,\u201d Barclays Plc analyst Lydia Rainforth wrote in a research note. \u201cBut with the macro environment still challenging, this may take some time to reflect in the share price.\u201dOil\u2019s coronavirus-induced plunge has seen Shell\u2019s peers also take drastic steps to shore up the balance sheet. BP Plc said in June it planned to cut 10,000 jobs, Chevron Corp. intends to trim 10% to 15% of its global workforce, while Exxon Mobil Corp. is reviewing staffing country by country.Shell began the process in May, when Van Beurden told staff in a memo that it was reshaping the company to make it slimmer and more resilient and that there could be redundancies in the second half of the year, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The Anglo-Dutch major offered voluntary severance, scaled back recruitment and reviewed expatriate staff contracts.\u201cThese incremental details should help investors who think Shell has been sitting on its hands in recent months,\u201d RBC Capital analyst Biraj Borkhataria wrote in a note. But he said shareholders will want more details on the company\u2019s plans, expected to be revealed at Shell\u2019s strategy day on Feb. 11.Emissions GoalsThe reorganization is also designed to further Shell\u2019s expanded green ambitions. The company said in April it planned to eliminate all net emissions from its own operations and the bulk of greenhouse gases from fuel it sells to its customers by 2050. Shell also said that ultimately, it would only do business with emission-free companies.European oil majors making a strategic shift into cleaner fuels have faced questions from investors about the profitability of renewables, which typically bring in single-digit returns. BP\u2019s shares fell to a 25-year low a week after it outlined plans to boost renewables returns.Shell insists that with time, its power division will bring in 8% to 12%. While oil and gas projects have historically brought in higher figures, returns in that industry have recently dwindled. Van Beurden said in May that \u201c8% to 12% currently we don\u2019t even make in our upstream business.\u201dRead our QuickTake explainer: How Peak Oil\u2019s Outlook Is Changing Under the Pandemic(Updates with job loss details in sixth paragraph, share price in eighth.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."}]}
