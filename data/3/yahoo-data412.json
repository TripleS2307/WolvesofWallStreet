About 90% of Nike\u2019s physical stores in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the Asia Pacific region were closed for about eight weeks during the quarter.Nike warned in a mid-May update that closures would generate \u201csignificantly lower wholesale revenue and higher inventory\u201d during the fourth quarter, and exert a \u201cmaterial impact\u201d on results across its regions. The company\u2019s closely watched gross margin shrank 820 basis points, to 37.2%, in the fourth quarter \u2014 driven in part by factory cancelation charges, rising inventory reserves and supply chain costs.The Beaverton, Oregon-based company said 90% of company-owned stores were open as of Thursday, including 100% of stores in China. Retail traffic \u201ccontinue to improve week-over-week with higher conversion rates as compared to the prior year,\u201d Nike added.The previous quarter through the end of February saw Nike\u2019s sales hold up more strongly than expected, even given closures that at the time had swept China.However, it managed to offset some revenue declines due to retail store closures in China with a more than 30% surge in digital sales.That dynamic continued to an extent across Nike\u2019s other geographies in the reported quarter, but not by enough to buoy overall sales. Nike\u2019s digital sales surged 75% in the fourth quarter, comprising about 30% of overall revenue.Story continues\u201cAs physical retail re-opens, NIKE's strong digital trends continue, a testament to the strength of our brand and the investments we've made to elevate digital consumer experiences,\u201d Nike Chief Financial Officer Matt Friend said in a statement.Shares of Nike have fallen less than half a percent for the year to date, versus a decline of 4.8% in the S&P 500.This post is breaking.
