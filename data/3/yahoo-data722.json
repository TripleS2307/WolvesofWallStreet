In technical positions, the share of black employees at the Rock Round, Texas\u2013based company drops to 4.2%; and in management positions, the proportion of black employees falls to 2.9%, the report says.Nearly all of the company\u2019s board of directors and C-suite officers are white. The company\u2019s chief diversity & inclusion officer, Brian Reaves, is black.\u201cWe have for a long time embraced diversity inside our company,\u201d Dell says. \u201cNot saying we're perfect at it, but I think we've created the conditions for success and in a bit of a silver lining, I think this has opened up the conversation in a new way.\u201dStory continuesMichael Dell, chairman and CEO of Dell Technologies, appears on \"Influencers with Andy Serwer.\"Dell made the remarks in an episode of Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cInfluencers with Andy Serwer,\u201d a weekly interview series with leaders in business, politics, and entertainment.At age 19, Dell founded his first business called PC\u2019s Limited. He renamed the company Dell Computer Corporation and took it public four years later. Today, the company has a market cap of over $36 billion.Dell expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of public sector solutions to racial inequality, arguing instead that businesses need to tackle the problem.\u201cUltimately, I'll just say I'm not real optimistic that government forces are going to drive the change here,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it's going to be up to companies to create the conditions and the opportunities for success for the communities that have not had them.\u201d\u201cRecent incidents have kind of redoubled our resolve around the goals that we've had,\u201d he says. \u201cHopefully that will lead to positive change for communities of color.\u201dRead more:U.S. needs 'cultural transformation' after George Floyd's death: Chase KochVenture firm is a 'win-win' for Koch Industries and company founders: Chase KochMelinda Gates: Some governors are \u2018moving too fast\u2019 to reopen their states\u2018We may need to quarantine our books' when libraries reopen, New York Public Library CEO saysRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"}]}
