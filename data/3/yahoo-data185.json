(AP Photo/Michael Conroy)Pantheon Macro\u2019s Ian Shepherdson wrote in a note that the drop in unemployment is a \u201cdistraction,\u201d from more bad news. \u201cThe loss of momentum is consistent with other near-real-time indicators, and we see little chance of a quick re-acceleration,\u201d he said.There are myriad reasons why the next leg could be so difficult.\u201cPPP funds are running dry and the impasse in Congress to reauthorize another round for struggling small businesses most affected by the pandemic are recipes for a wave of small business closures, particularly among restaurants and small retailers,\u201d wrote Cox.And for those restaurants, colder weather is coming, which will disrupt outdoor seating plans many adopted in order to reopen.Ripley said the details in the jobs report \u201cshould signal to lawmakers that another round of fiscal stimulus will be needed to keep the economic recovery on track.\u201d But Congress remains divided over additional coronavirus relief.Story continuesThe devil in the detailsWhile the headline employment numbers were strong, the details painted a starker picture of the economy.\u201c238,000 of those job additions were only temporary government jobs and the overall pace of hiring seems to be slowing,\u201d Ripley wrote. These workers were hired by the government to perform the Census, something that only happens every 10 years.Ripley and others have also pointed out that the number of people who have lost jobs permanently \u2014 as opposed to temporary job loss because of coronavirus \u2014 have ticked up significantly by 534,000 to 3.4 million, after holding relatively steady.More \"temporary layoffs\" are proving to be not-so temporary https://t.co/Qn8SxBYuqJ pic.twitter.com/Y9wSZc5ypw\u2014 Sam Ro \ud83d\udcc8 (@SamRo) September 4, 2020While restaurant and hospitality workers saw \u201cstrong gains,\u201d Ripley said, \u201cit\u2019s a drop in the bucket compared to the job losses that occurred back in April.\u201dMatt Luzzetti, chief economist at Deutsche Bank, stressed to Yahoo Finance that more stimulus is needed to keep the labor market healthy. Only 50% of jobs have come back, he said, and there\u2019s no reason for the government to \u201ctake its foot off the gas.\u201dLuzzetti warned that the fall may turn ugly again when it comes to layoffs.\u201cThe concern going forward is, do we see a spread of these layoffs to other areas,\u201d he said. \u201cThere's some evidence that could happen into October \u2014 you don't want to extrapolate these better-than-expected gains into future months.\u201dAnd when the vaccines hit the market, it may provide far more instant juice to the stock market than the labor market, whose response Luzzetti expects to lag.\u201cWe don\u2019t see output levels getting back to pre-pandemic levels until 2022,\u201d he said.--Ethan Wolff-Mann is a writer at Yahoo Finance focusing on consumer issues, personal finance, retail, airlines, and more.
