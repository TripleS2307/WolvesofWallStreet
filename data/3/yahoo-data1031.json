(Photo by Chris DELMAS / AFP) (Photo by CHRIS DELMAS/AFP via Getty Images)Epic Games, maker of the wildly popular \u201cFortnite,\u201d is at war with Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL). It fired its first shots by giving gamers the ability to make in-app purchases directly from its \u201cFortnite\u201d apps at a reduced price, circumventing Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s payment systems, ducking the 30% commissions the companies charge for digital purchases.Apple and Google responded by pulling \u201cFortnite\u201d from their respective app stores, and Epic, in turn, filed a pair of lawsuits seeking injunctions that would prohibit Apple and Google from blocking \u201cFortnite\u201d and Epic\u2019s other apps from either store.Epic\u2019s move hits both Apple and Google, but its attack on Apple was more highly orchestrated. Not only did the company release a digital short skewering Apple via a remake of its famous \u201c1984\u201d ad for the Macintosh, but it also timed the suit to land less than a month after Apple CEO Tim Cook appeared before the House Judiciary Committee to defend his company against claims that it abuses the App Store\u2019s market power to force developers to pay that 30% commission.Apple isn\u2019t backing down though, because any damage Epic might do to its App Store could have severe ramifications for one of the company\u2019s biggest money makers: its Services business.The App Store is essential to Apple\u2019s growthThe App Store is a multi-billion revenue source for Apple. It\u2019s also a major part of the firm\u2019s Services business, which it increasingly relies on, along its Wearables business, to prove it\u2019s not just an iPhone factory. It\u2019s also part of the reason the company\u2019s market value reached $2 trillion on Wednesday.[Read more: Apple\u2019s now worth $2 trillion]In Apple\u2019s fiscal Q3 2020, the Services business pulled in $13.16 billion, putting it second only to the company\u2019s iPhone business, which saw revenue of $26.42 billion in the quarter. The Wearables, iPad, and Mac businesses all brought in revenue of between $7 billion and $6 billion.Epic Games took a shot at Apple by parodying its famous Macintosh commercial. (Image: Epic)Apple doesn\u2019t separate its App Store revenue from the rest of its Services revenue, which includes things like Apple Care and subscriptions to services like Apple Music and iCloud, but a prior estimate from CNBC put revenue at about $50 billion in 2019, and TechCrunch reported that the company saw as much as $1.42 billion in revenue in the week between Christmas 2019 and New Years 2020.Story continuesAn Epic battleEpic\u2019s beef with Apple stems from the fact that Apple operates its iOS operating system as a \u201cwalled garden,\u201d meaning the company controls how and what kind of apps are available for your iPhone or iPad. Google, meanwhile, gives Android users the ability to install apps from third-party app stores. Though using those can be difficult for less tech savvy consumers.According to University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School professor Herbert Hovenkamp, Apple\u2019s App Store policies amount to what\u2019s known as \u201cexclusive dealing,\u201d which ensures developers have to pay that 30% commission if they want to get access to Apple\u2019s customers.\u201cThat, I think, is a viable antitrust claim if you state it that way. And I think Apple has some serious exposure mainly because it would be pretty easy for Apple to fix, which is to permit other app stores to locate on the Macintosh or iPhone platform,\u201d Hovenkamp explained.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with the 30% commission. The problem is where the agreement says you have to make all of your sales with us so we get to collect this 30% commission on all of them. And if a plaintiff can prove that, then that sounds to me like a viable exclusive dealing claim.\u201dApple regularly points to the fact that developers can always run web apps through a browser like Safari rather than operating native apps. But native iOS apps provide far better user experiences versus web applications.Apple isn\u2019t backing down, either. In a statement to Yahoo Finance, a spokesperson said Epic can get \u201cFortnite\u201d back into the App Store by simply removing the ability of consumers to pay the gaming company directly from within the app.\u201cWe won\u2019t make an exception for Epic because we don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to put their business interests ahead of the guidelines that protect our customers,\u201d the spokesperson said.Google, meanwhile, told Yahoo Finance through a spokesperson that while Android lets developers use multiple app stores, they still have to follow Google\u2019s rules if they want their apps to appear in the Play Store.Epic gave customers the option of paying via its own service at a reduced price, or by using Apple or Google's payment platforms. The game was then banned from the companies' respective app stores. (Image: Epic)\u201cWhile \u2018Fortnite\u2019 remains available on Android, we can no longer make it available on Play because it violates our policies. However, we welcome the opportunity to continue our discussions with Epic and bring \u2018Fortnite\u2019 back to Google Play,\u201d the spokesperson said.It\u2019s important to note that iOS users are generally more willing to spend on apps than Android users, which incentivizes developers to want to work with Apple.If Apple opened up iOS to other app stores, as Epic proposes, the company would have to contend with competition from those third-party stores. And if those stores are able to undercut Apple\u2019s pricing, it would eat into Services revenue, something the company has made a major focus since Cook\u2019s 2017 promise to double the business\u2019s revenue by 2020. Apple reached that goal by the end of 2019.Epic isn\u2019t Apple\u2019s only problemEpic\u2019s lawsuit comes as state attorneys general, the Department of Justice, and the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law investigate claims that the App Store functions as an illegal monopoly.It\u2019s also one of several high-profile tech companies that have filed complaints about or publicly indicated their distaste for Apple\u2019s App Store policies.Spotify has repeatedly challenged Apple\u2019s App Store guidelines, saying that it\u2019s unfair that Spotify has to pay a 30% commission on app purchases, while Apple is able to offer its own competing service in Apple Music without having to pay such a fee.And more recently, Microsoft (MSFT) and Facebook (FB) have gone after Apple for not allowing them to operate their Project xCloud cloud gaming and Facebook Gaming apps, respectively. Both of those companies used language in their responses to Apple that would pique the interest of antitrust investigators, with phrases pointing to harm to consumers and an arbitrary application of App Store rules.Apple, for its part, has maintained that it treats all App Store apps equally, and that it offers a host of important services to developers including access to tools and assistance in ensuring apps function properly with Apple devices.Apple\u2019s antitrust issues are unlikely to end in the company being split up, experts say. However, it could end up having to let developers install their apps on Apple devices outside of the App Store, or allow for additional app stores to be made available on the iPhone. And the firm may need to prepare for that eventuality.More from Dan:Got a tip?
