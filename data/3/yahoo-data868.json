(The Environmental Protection Agency has found that \u201chydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances.\u201d)The issue of fracking has become a lightning rod in this year\u2019s presidential election, particularly in the critical battle ground state of Pennsylvania, the second-largest natural gas producer in the nation.President Donald Trump board Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base, Md., Tuesday, Sept. 8, 2020. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)In recent campaign stops in Pennsylvania, both President Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden reassured industry workers that their jobs were safe. Biden even accused Trump of spreading banning fracking \u201clies\u201d about him.\u201cI am not banning fracking. Let me say that again: I am not banning fracking. No matter how many times Donald Trump lies about me,\u201d Biden said in Pittsburgh on Aug. 30.Trump has stated numerous times that Biden would harm the fossil fuel industry. \u201cHe\u2019s already written it off. It\u2019s gone. No fracking. That\u2019s part of his platform,\u201d Trump said in a speech in Texas on July 29.Biden\u2019s comments sparked confusion over his fracking policy because in a March 15 debate with former presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), he stated there would be \u201cno new fracking\u201d under his administration.So Biden wouldn\u2019t support new fracking on federal lands, but he wouldn\u2019t ban fracking on private land, a top policy priority for environmentalists \u2013 somewhat confusing, but likely also a strategy aimed at garnering votes from fossil fuel industry workers.Story continuesDemocratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden speaks during an event with local union members in the backyard of a home in Lancaster, Pa., Monday, Sept. 7, 2020.

(Former Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt resigned in 2018, in the wake of numerous ethics investigations.)\u201cWhat is important here is that [Biden has a] platform that is focusing on transitioning to a fossil fuel free environment economy in the future, and actually, the plan that he has put forward is quite, you know, progressive in that way,\u201d Cruz said.Biden\u2019s $2 trillion climate plan aims to reduce fossil fuel use and transition the U.S. to carbon-free energy by 2035.More from Sibile:Job cuts come for white-collar workers: \u2018There are no truly recession-proof\u2019 occupationsThe Trump payroll tax break you won\u2019t see on your paycheck\u2018Ghosting\u2019 is not just for lovers.
