Airbnb now carries a valuation of $18 billion, down from $31 billion before the pandemic. The home rental startup\u2019s business model is not suited to America\u2019s new normal.But Airbnb would like to go public this year anyway. And on Wednesday, the company confidentially filed its IPO papers with the SEC.Airbnb executives, employees, and investors are ready for their big liquidity event, and they\u2019re betting that public market investors will want in, despite the recent troubles.It\u2019s a good bet. The market has been extremely patient over the past few years with money-losing Silicon Valley unicorns, focusing instead on their narrative and future growth runway. It\u2019s why you hear so much from tech unicorns about their TAM, or total addressable market.\u201cAs we look at the second half of this year, we see a lot of these companies that might have gotten hit with the Covid downturn, but if they have that narrative around how they\u2019re going to come out of this, and what that looks like going forward, the public markets are being more forgiving,\u201d says Jack Cassel, VP of new listing and capital markets at Nasdaq. \u201cThey\u2019re buying into the story, the management team, and the vision of the company for the long-term.\u201dBrian Chesky, CEO and Co-founder of Airbnb, speaks to the Economic Club of New York at a luncheon at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S. March 13, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Segar\u201cWhen you think of some of the unicorns that have remained private for so long, they\u2019re very smart about telling their story early in their life cycle,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re meeting with analysts, they\u2019re meeting with buy-side investors, large institutional firms, starting to test their narrative.\u201dAirbnb has certainly told its narrative well over the past few years. The origin story is by now well-worn: Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia, friends from Rhode Island School of Design, had the idea in 2007 to rent out their San Francisco apartment during a big design conference in town. They bought three air mattresses and called the site AirBedAndBreakfast.com. Their friend Nathan Blecharczyk joined them as the third cofounder. The company\u2019s rapid growth is often credited in part to its appealing web design.Story continuesThe home-sharing company became part of the travel culture for young people, a legitimate threat to traditional hotels, and a prime example, along with Uber and Lyft, of the meteoric rise of the sharing economy\u2014before the pandemic.By going public at a time when its business is severely weakened, Airbnb is taking the same tack as DraftKings, which went public in April (by merging with an SPAC) even though live sports, which its entire business depends on, were completely shut down. DraftKings simply kept saying that its business would return in full force as soon as sports returned. CEO Jason Robins told Yahoo Finance in April that the sports pause was \u201ca temporary thing... people will be eager to reactivate when sports do come back.\u201dAirbnb is making the same pitch: Our business will come back when things return to normal. But there\u2019s a key difference: major U.S. sports like the NBA, MLB, NHL, and Major League Soccer have returned to play, and even though they\u2019re playing without fans in the stands, DraftKings users can play fantasy contests or place bets on the games in states where it\u2019s legal. Vacations have not fully returned to normalcy, and it could be many months until they do.Despite mounting losses, Airbnb reportedly plans to IPO this year. (Photo by Yuriko Nakao/Getty Images)In an interview with Yahoo Finance editor in chief Andy Serwer last month, Chesky said that back in January he fully expected Airbnb to go public in 2020, \u201cand then suddenly all global travel basically comes to a near standstill. We took the S-1 document and didn\u2019t file it, we put it on a shelf. And recently, we\u2019ve dusted it off... But we also don\u2019t want to go public if the world\u2019s not ready for us. If people are really nervous about travel, they aren\u2019t really clear about Airbnb, then the market\u2019s not ready.\u201dBy many data points, Americans are indeed still \u201cnervous about travel.\u201d But Airbnb did see a return to bookings growth in July, and that was with \u201cspending very few dollars on advertising,\u201d Chesky told Yahoo Finance. It helps the company\u2019s case that its business can return... eventually.Of course, Airbnb isn\u2019t the only company trying to go public before the end of this year, and likely aiming to get it done before the market volatility the election could spark. July saw 43 IPOs begin trading in the U.S., the highest July tally since 2014.\u2014Daniel Roberts is an editor-at-large at Yahoo Finance and closely covers tech.
