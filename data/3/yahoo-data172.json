Here were the main metrics from the report, compared to Bloomberg estimates:Initial jobless claims, week ended Sept. 19: 870,000 vs. 840,000 expected, and 866,000 during the prior weekContinuing claims, week ended Sept. 12: 12.580 million vs. 12.275 million expected, and 12.747 million during the prior weekAt 870,000, Thursday\u2019s figure represented the fourth consecutive week that new jobless claims came in below the psychologically important 1 million level, but was still high on a historical basis. Nevertheless, the labor market has made strides in recovering from the pandemic-era spike high of nearly 7 million weekly new claims seen in late March.\u201cWhile jobless claims under a million for four straight weeks could be considered a positive, we\u2019re staring down a pretty stagnant labor market,\u201d Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy for E-Trade Financial Corporation, said in an email Thursday. \u201cThis has been a slow roll to recovery and with no signs of additional stimulus from Washington, jobless Americans will likely continue to exist in limbo. Further, a shaky labor market translates into a skittish consumer, and in the face of a pandemic that seemingly won\u2019t go away without a vaccine, the outlook for the economy certainly comes into question.\u201dOn an unadjusted basis, initial jobless claims rose by a greater margin, or about 28,500, from the previous week to about 824,500. The seasonally adjusted level of new claims rose by 4,000 week on week.By state, unadjusted claims in California \u2013 where joblessness due to the pandemic has compounded with labor market stress due to wildfires \u2013 were again the highest in the country at more than 230,000, for an increase of about 4,400 week-over-week. Georgia, New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts also reported significant increases in new claims relative to the rest of the country. Most states reported at least increases in new claims last week.Story continuesContinuing claims have also trended lower after a peak of nearly 25 million in May, and fell for a second straight week in this week\u2019s report. But these claims, which capture the total number of individuals still receiving unemployment insurance, have not broken below the 12 million mark since before the pandemic took hold of the labor market in mid-March.Hundreds of people line up outside a Kentucky Career Center hoping to find assistance with their unemployment claim in Frankfort, Kentucky, U.S. June 18, 2020. REUTERS/Bryan WoolstonConsistently high numbers of individuals have been filing for, and receiving, jobless benefits from regular state programs, and those newly created during the pandemic. The number of individuals claiming benefits in all programs for the week ended September 5 \u2013 the latest reported week \u2013 fell for the first time following three straight weeks of increases to 26.04 million, from the nearly 29.8 million reported during the prior week.Of that total, more than 11.5 million comprised individuals receiving Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, which is aimed at self-employed and gig workers who don\u2019t qualify for regular unemployment compensation but have still been impacted by the pandemic.One of the major downside risks to further improvement in the labor market has been concern that Congress may not soon pass another round of fiscal stimulus aimed at keeping individuals on payrolls during the pandemic. Economists have already said that the end of the last round of augmented federal unemployment benefits in late July has weighed on improvements in joblessness.\u201cThe current picture suggests that growth has slowed sharply in the past three months, and that the labor market is stalling again in the face of rising infections and the sudden ending of federal government support to unemployed people,\u201d Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a note Wednesday.The need for more fiscal stimulus to encourage the economy\u2019s ongoing recovery has become a key talking point of policymakers including Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues at the central bank. In congressional testimony Tuesday and Wednesday, the Fed leader said further fiscal stimulus is \u201cunequaled\u201d by any other form of support that could be unleashed, with the central bank\u2019s lending facilities having gone largely untouched by Main Street.Another 870,000 Americans filed for new unemployment claims last week on a seasonally adjusted basis.
