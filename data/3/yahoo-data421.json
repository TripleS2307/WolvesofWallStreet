Gwen Moore told Yahoo Finance in a recent interview.Washington\u2019s increasingly acrimonious battle over the U.S. Postal Service is poised to get even more polarizing, now that the Democratic-led Congress has passed a $25 billion rescue package that Trump immediately dismissed as a \u201choax.\u201dPlagued by slow service and deficit spending for years, the USPS is now caught in the mother of all political battles ahead of the general election. The fight has been amplified by the coronavirus pandemic, which has prompted many states to weigh mail-in ballots to spur voting without having to gather in large groups.Moore charged that Trump is \u201ctrying to undermine the Post Office. He\u2019s suing states that are looking for ways to expand the opportunities to get ballots to voters,\u201d she told Yahoo Finance on Friday.\u201cI have absolutely no hope that I\u2019m going to wake up on the morning of November 4 and know what the results of the election are,\u201d she added.Postmaster General Louis DeJoy sought to reassure lawmakers on Friday that mail-in ballots sent close to Election Day would be delivered. However, Moore blasted Trump for suggesting that not all of those votes would count, something she labeled \u201ccriminal.\u201dMeanwhile, Democrats are training volunteers to help make every vote count.\u201cWe have trained 100,000 people [virtually], more than we could have in person, to sort of meet the challenges that we face. You know, we understand that when we get the vote out, we win,\u201d said Moore.Biden has \u2018no power to do anything right now\u2019Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden speaks during the fourth day of the Democratic National Convention, Thursday, Aug. 20, 2020, at the Chase Center in Wilmington, Del. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)For the tens of millions of Americans currently collecting unemployment benefits during the pandemic, economic relief is still mired in political gridlock as Congress and the White House struggle to find consensus.Story continues\u201cI have to admit, we are in a bind. And [Democratic presidential nominee] Joe Biden is in a bind too. He has no power to do anything right now,\u201d the Milwaukee Democrat told Yahoo Finance.During the Democratic National Convention last week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi blamed Republicans for the deadlocked negotiations.Recognizing that electing Biden won\u2019t put an end to the political standoff, Democrats are pinning their hopes on flipping seats in the Senate. That includes in Kentucky, where Democratic candidate Amy McGrath is challenging Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Nov. 3.\u201cI\u2019m not convinced that Mitch McConnell will be reelected, nor am I convinced that...he\u2019ll be able to maintain his majority in the United States Senate. None of us had really realistically hoped that we would flip the Senate, until recently,\u201d said Moore.Democrats are speculating that voters in red states, dismayed by Trump\u2019s attack on the postal service, may sour further on him.\u201cI think that there are many voters in red states who are puzzled by for example the president\u2019s desire to destroy the Post Office,\u201d said Moore \u2014 adding that rising COVID-19 casualties in the Sun Belt region is also a factor.More from Sibile:Trump payroll tax deferment is \u2018employee relations disaster\u2019Coronavirus gut check: How small businesses are survivingHow Hollywood content can \u2018normalize injustice\u2019Michigan Gov.
