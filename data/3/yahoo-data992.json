With an easing of restrictions on mobility and commerce and the extension of federal loans and grants, some businesses are opening up, while stimulus checks and unemployment benefits are supporting household incomes and spending,\u201d Powell said in his prepared remarks.\u201cAs a result, employment moved higher in May. That said, the levels of output and employment remain far below their pre-pandemic levels, and significant uncertainty remains about the timing and strength of the recovery. Much of that economic uncertainty comes from uncertainty about the path of the disease and the effects of measures to contain it. Until the public is confident that the disease is contained, a full recovery is unlikely,\u201d he added.ING economist James Knightley agreed with Powell. \u201cAs Jerome Powell states, we cannot signal the all-clear until COVID-19 is beaten, or at least properly contained. The recent spike in new cases in several states suggests we need to make much more progress here, with the threat that renewed lockdowns could have a massive impact on confidence, risk assets and of course economic activity,\u201d he wrote in a note Tuesday.\u2014Heidi Chung is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
