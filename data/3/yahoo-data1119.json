But researchers are just beginning to dig into what people are doing with it.The early data suggests there are \"two big ways people are spending their checks,\u201d Joanna Smith-Ramani, managing director of the Aspen Institute Financial Security Program, told Yahoo Finance\u2019s On the Move.The first way is with immediate spending. Researchers from four business schools recently found \u201cstimulus recipients are parting with their money remarkably quickly.\u201d A survey in May found that about half of people who got a check had already put a majority of the money toward paying bills or buying essentials.Read more: Coronavirus stimulus checks: Why your payment would be smaller than expectedRetailers have noticed the money heading out the door. \u201cWe do see a positive impact from the checks\u201d Walmart U.S. CEO John Furner told Yahoo Finance in May. Target CEO Brian Cornell also has seen the payments translate into spending.The patterns, if they hold up, are a change from 2001 and 2008 \u2014 the two most recent examples of stimulus checks being sent to Americans. During those rounds, researchers found that many people didn\u2019t spend the money quickly and a large proportion of the eventual spending went to durable goods like home appliances, furniture, or new cars.This is how The Economic Impact Payment checks will look like.

The Bipartisan Policy Center asked voters how they were spending the money and the most common answer was \u2018to save or invest\u2019 \u2014 followed closely by buying food and paying essential bills.Smith-Ramani thinks she knows why the savings rate is high.\u201cFolks are really worried about what's coming in the future\u201d she said, adding that \u201ccash matters deeply\u201d when there\u2019s no guarantee of additional stimulus.Read more: Coronavirus stimulus checks: What it means for your taxesResearchers have found that the biggest predictor of who saved their money was liquid assets \u2014 not income. The groups of people who saw big income changes downward \u2014 suggesting a job loss \u2014 had stimulus check spending that \u201cwas only slightly elevated compared to users whose income was unchanged.\u201dStory continuesSmith-Ramani noted that for those who were lucky enough to have a steady income, \u201cthis was a little bit of a surplus you weren't expecting.\u201d But those people do not appear \u2014 at least so far \u2014 to be using the money to splurge.\u201cThey're worried they'll have to go through this themselves\u201d she said of the ongoing pandemic and a recent surge in cases across the country.The 2008 economic stimulus checks are printed at the Kansas City Regional Financial Center in Kansas City, Missouri, May 8, 2008.

The Democratic-led House of Representatives passed a bill in May with more checks. On Monday, President Trump backed the idea of more checks but many of his Republican colleagues have expressed skepticism of additional measures.Smith-Ramani appeared as part of Yahoo Finance\u2019s ongoing partnership with the Funding our Future campaign, a group of organizations advocating for increased retirement security for Americans.
