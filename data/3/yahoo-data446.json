Gary Peters (D-MI) on a call with reporters. Peters has led the Democratic push for Senate hearings and he\u2019ll be the party\u2019s lead questioner Friday, the first opportunity Democrats have had to publicly ask DeJoy questions.Senate Minority Leader Sen.

Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, agreed to hold the hearing and said in a statement it would be a chance for DeJoy to describe the financial problems at the USPS \u201cbefore going before a hostile House committee determined to conduct a show trial.\u201dDeJoy will indeed likely face more aggressive questioning on Monday. Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) runs the House oversight committee and has promised \u201cwe will get answers for the American people.\u201d Maloney is set to ask questions alongside a group of high-profile Democrats, including Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-VA), Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), and Rep. Katie Porter (D-CA).I hope the Postmaster General comes prepared. I know I will. https://t.co/Lan1in5UmH\u2014 Rep. Katie Porter (@RepKatiePorter) August 17, 2020In a recent MSNBC interview, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the issue has been \"volcanic\" in mobilizing members of both parties to defend the service.Story continues\u2018I am suspending these initiatives\u2019In the midst of the Democratic pile-on Tuesday, DeJoy announced changes to how his agency would handle the election. Since taking the job weeks ago, he has removed leaders and implemented \u201coperational changes\u201d that critics say is a blatant effort to hamstring the USPS and hinder mail-in voting during a pandemic.\u201cTo avoid even the appearance of any impact on election mail, I am suspending these initiatives until after the election is concluded,\u201d DeJoy announced Tuesday. It was a striking reversal after several states, including New Jersey, had announced plans for lawsuits.Postmaster General Louis DeJoy recently met privately with Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer. The Democrats left the meeting deeply dissatisfied.

Gerry Connolly, a leading Democrat in the House on the issue, immediately tweeted that \u201cCongressional oversight cannot be interrupted.\u201d Sen. Peters, in a statement, added that \u201cthere are still too many unanswered questions.\u201dI just spoke to Postmaster DeJoy. I told him I want a specific, written document of exactly what he's rescinding and explicit confirmation all election mail will be treated as First Class.We cannot allow two things as sacred as the Post Office and our elections to be undermined\u2014 Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) August 18, 2020Democrats have also signaled that there are plenty of topics beyond the election they\u2019re likely to explore.\u201cWe are getting calls all the time from senior citizens: their prescriptions have come late,\u201d Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) said in an interview with Yahoo Finance. He called DeJoy a \u201cpolitical hack,\u201d adding: \u201cpeople that might have been voting Republican are pretty angry at the post office for doing this.\u201dAnother likely line of inquiry are DeJoy\u2019s financial ties. He worked in logistics before coming to Washington and has maintained ties that have raised conflict of interest questions across Washington and, reportedly, within the office of the Postmaster Inspector General.Mail boxes in the parking lot of a post office in the Bronx in New York. (Bryan R. Smith / AFP)DeJoy reportedly still owns a sizable stake in his former company XPO Logistics \u2013 a USPS contractor \u2013 and also recently bought stock options in Amazon, which competes with the service.Schumer has said he believes that Trump and DeJoy\u2019s overall motivation is \u201cjust to destroy the Post Office.\u201dAnother outstanding question which DeJoy\u2019s surprise announcement Tuesday does not address is additional funding for the USPS. Democrats have been pushing, as part of broader stimulus negotiations, for up to $25 billion for the service in the coming years.Democrats are set to vote this weekend on a bill, sponsored by Maloney, which would prohibit the postal service from implementing any changes to the operations it had in place on Jan. 1 until the COVID-19 pandemic has ended.It\u2019s unclear if the Senate will take up the bill, but we're \"going to push very, very hard,\" Schumer said.Ben Werschkul is a producer for Yahoo Finance in Washington, DC.Read more:\u2018We see it here every day\u2019: How a slowdown in the Postal Service is impacting small businessesUSPS in 'dire' financial position, says Postmaster GeneralShowdowns over the Postal Service loom as a union chief says Trump is \u2018scapegoating\u2019 membersRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit."}]}
