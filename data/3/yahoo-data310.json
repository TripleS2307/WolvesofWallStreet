Although the Fed had already previously committed to individual corporate bond purchases, the Fed\u2019s intention to create its own index suggests that the central bank will pick the bonds to buy as opposed to wait for sellers to offer them.Bank of America\u2019s global research team noted Tuesday that the Fed\u2019s move is \u201cbullish\u201d for spreads, which tightened in response to Monday\u2019s announcement.Pennsylvania Republican Pat Toomey on Tuesday pressed Powell on the need for the corporate debt purchases, arguing that the Fed may \u201cdiminish price signals\u201d in the market.Powell insisted that Monday\u2019s announcement is not for the purposes of increasing the dollar volume of the corporate debt facility but for \u201cshifting away\u201d from bond ETFs in favor of its own index of bonds. Powell added that the Fed had committed to backstopping the corporate debt markets as early as late March.\u201cWe feel that we need to follow through and do what we said we were going to do,\u201d Powell said.Close up of the Federal Reserve building with the eagle statue.The Fed\u2019s corporate bond purchases are currently being done through its Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility, which began operations on May 12 with plans to continue through September 30. The facility is backed by $25 billion of equity from the U.S. Treasury, appropriated through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act passed in March.Story continuesA separate facility, the Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility, plans on purchasing corporate debt directly from the issuers themselves. The facility, which is backed by $50 billion of equity, has yet to go live.Powell, who said he originally expected heavy demand in the primary market, says he now sees no demand.Combined, the two facilities can be levered up to support as much as $750 billion in purchases. As of June 10, the secondary facility had only $5.5 billion of purchases, all in bond ETFs.Powell said market functioning has improved \u201csubstantially\u201d since setting up its operations.\u201cIf things go in a negative direction, we want to make sure that we\u2019re there,\u201d Powell told Congress.Brian Cheung is a reporter covering the Fed, economics, and banking for Yahoo Finance.
