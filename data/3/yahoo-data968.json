Existing Disney+ subscribers will have to pay $29.99 to watch \u201cMulan,\u201d but it\u2019s a digital purchase, not a rental; the movie will live in their Disney+ library for repeated viewings.The steep $30 fee raised eyebrows at first, but Universal had enormous success in April when it released \u201cTrolls World Tour\u201d as a $20 digital rental, raking more in rental fees in three weeks than the first \u201cTrolls\u201d movie made in theaters in five months. Viewers willingly paid $20 for a one-time rental; \u201cMulan\u201d is $10 pricier, but it\u2019s a purchase. And Disney will still put \u201cMulan\u201d in some theaters in markets where Disney+ has not launched (think China).Disney CEO Bob Chapek was careful to caution on the earnings call, \u201cWe\u2019re looking at \u2018Mulan\u2019 as a one-off as opposed to saying that there\u2019s some new business windowing model we\u2019re looking at.\u201dThat specific comment is a direct appeal to movie theater operators like AMC, which were furious after what Universal did with \u201cTrolls World Tour.\u201d (AMC threatened not to show Universal movies in the future.)But the \u201cMulan\u201d plan is only a \u201cone-off\u201d until it isn\u2019t. If it works, Disney could do it again\u2014maybe almost immediately, with the Marvel movie \u201cBlack Widow,\u201d which has also been delayed until November theatrical release and could end up as a Disney+ rental. Disney dominated the 2019 box office thanks to Marvel movies, including \u201cAvengers: Endgame,\u201d which leapfrogged \u201cAvatar\u201d as the highest-grossing box office movie ever. \u201cBlack Widow\u201d tells the origin story of Scarlett Johansson\u2019s character Natasha Romanoff, a member of the Avengers.Story continuesAnd Julia Alexander of tech site The Verge cites a Disney+ source saying, \u201cWe\u2019ve put in enough work that it\u2019s not a one-off.\u201dA hand sanitisation station set up for the European premiere for \"Mulan\" in London on March 12, 2020. The premiere was canceled due to coronavirus. REUTERS/Henry NichollsDisney\u2019s \u201cMulan\u201d move says a lot about its streaming strategies.For starters, it overtly reaffirms what chairman Bob Iger said last year before Disney+ ever launched: that the direct-to-consumer business (i.e. streaming) is now the company\u2019s \u201cnumber one priority.\u201d Disney+ is now up to 60.5 million paying subscribers, and Disney has 100 million subscribers total across Disney+, ESPN+, and Hulu. On Tuesday, it announced it will launch yet another streaming service outside the U.S., under the Star banner, which it acquired in the Fox deal.The \u201cMulan\u201d plan also shows Disney is willing to do what Warner Brothers (or at least director Christopher Nolan) is not willing to do with \u201cTenet,\u201d which is still slated for theatrical release on Sept. 3 before it goes digital. And even if Warner Bros. won\u2019t do it with \u201cTenet,\u201d if Disney reaps big fees from \u201cMulan,\u201d other studios will be likelier to consider the straight-to-digital path in the future, even post-pandemic.Disney\u2019s streaming success is the only reason the stock closed Wednesday up 8.8% even though the company lost $4.7 billion in its third quarter (it reported a non-GAAP profit of 8 cents per share thanks to deferred payments to sports leagues). Revenue at its theme parks division was down a devastating 85% from Q3 2019 due to the pandemic, many of its parks remain closed, its cruise lines remain shuttered, and filming of many new projects was delayed.Disney\u2019s streaming gains are carrying the stock. If the pandemic sticks around for many more months, look for some other Disney releases to follow the \u201cMulan\u201d recipe.\u2014Daniel Roberts is an editor-at-large at Yahoo Finance.
