But on Monday, new visa restrictions announced by the federal government left her worried.\u201cIt's very disheartening and very confusing,\u201d Nay, who didn\u2019t want to use her last name, told Yahoo Finance.Visa guidelines for international students announced by the Trump administration have thrown the entire higher education industry \u2014 from students to university deans \u2014 into a tailspin. For colleges already scrambling to figure out how to safely open their campuses this fall amid a pandemic, the industry now worries about its future.\u201cI mean, I have to be honest, this one caught me much more by surprise,\u201d Greg Siskind, an immigration lawyer based in Memphis, told Yahoo Finance. Unlike the travel bans, \u201cwe didn\u2019t see this coming,\u201d he said.The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign campus on Friday, Jan. 31, 2020. (PHOTO: E. Jason Wambsgans/Chicago Tribune/Tribune News Service via Getty Images)On July 6, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) announced it was making changes to how it treated international students with F-1 and M-1 visas. If a student is taking an entirely online course in the fall 2020 semester, they cannot remain in the U.S., unless they transfer to a school with in-person instruction \u201cto remain in lawful status.\u201dIf they fail to do so, \u201cthey may face immigration consequences including, but not limited to, the initiation of removal proceedings,\u201d according to ICE.But if the school is offering a hybrid model \u2014 both in-person and online education, like Columbia and Yale \u2014 they\u2019ll be allowed to take more than one class online and stay in the U.S. But the school needs to certify their status to the government.To be clear, most international students will likely be able to continue their studies \u2014 as long as their school is not going completely remote. (Eight percent of U.S. colleges are planning for an online-only semester, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education.) But the announcement threw some for a loop: Nay said she\u2019s concerned and is poring over the ICE website, looking for more information.Story continues\u201cWe're all very scared just because some of us have things going on in this country that would not be able to carry back home \u2014 like work, I would for sure lose that job if I had to go back home,\u201d she said.There\u2019s also a 12-hour time difference between Indonesia and the U.S. that could create a struggle with afternoon classes. Nay said she\u2019s also worried about the COVID-19 outbreak in Indonesia.A Harvard Law School student on campus on May 28, 2020. (PHOTO: Craig F. Walker/The Boston Globe via Getty Images)\u2018Hit \u2018em while they\u2019re down\u2019For the higher education industry, the financial implications of this move are likely to be severe, experts warned.\u201cLook, higher ed is getting hit from all sides right now,\u201d Jeff Brown, dean of the Gies College at the University of Illinois, told Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cOn The Move.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re coming off several decades of decline in public support for higher education, and now we have an economic recession, which is affecting donors\u2019 ability and willingness \u2026 To be honest, it\u2019s just not helpful \u2014 it\u2019s like, let\u2019s hit \u2018em while they\u2019re down.\u201dHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s not a good thing for higher ed [and] more importantly, it\u2019s not a good thing for the long-term health of the U.S. economy.\u201d The University of Illinois plans a hybrid approach of both in-person and online classes for the fall.\u2018It doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense\u2019Research from New American Economy shows that at last count in 2014, 5% of the postsecondary student population was comprised of students in the U.S. on temporary visas.Estimates from the U.S. Department of Commerce shows that international students have contributed $45 billion to the U.S. economy during the 2017/2018 academic year \u2014 and is ranked fifth among service exports, supporting 455,000 U.S. jobs.F-1 students \u2014 and M-1 students \u2014 are considered nonimmigrant; they have applied and received a temporary visa from the U.S. government to pursue higher education in the U.S.\u201cIt doesn't make a lot of sense,\u201d Brendan Cantwell, associate professor at Michigan State University, who studies politics in higher education, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cIt's almost like this rule was intentionally written to create uncertainty and fear.\u201dAside from creating confusion among students, it also creates \u201chuge administrative burden \u2026 on colleges and universities, because they're going to have to verify for each student,\u201d Cantwell said. \u201cThey're going to have to verify for each student that they're meeting its requirement\u2026 they\u2019re going to have to do student by student program by program.\u201d\u201cIt sounds like it is not at all flexible,\u201d Cantwell added.For instance, if a campus were to start off offering a hybrid model and then later on, switch to entirely remote if the COVID situation worsens, the student may be forced to go home mid-semester.\u201cAnybody who is in that situation where ICE comes down on them \u2014 I would go to a lawyer,\u201d Siskind said.More broadly, the move also \"raises a question about the humane treatment of people,\u201d Cantwell said. \u201cAnd there's also a simple logistic question, right?... It may not be possible for students to get flights.\u201dOverall, \u201cI just don't see how ICE has the knowledge or capability to audit it effectively,\u201d he said. \u201cThe order shows a sort ignorance about the way colleges and universities work.\"A student at Bunker Hill Community College poses for a portrait while on campus in Boston on June 11, 2020. The repercussions of the pandemic have reverberated deeply at community colleges, which serve primarily part-time students who juggle families and jobs, and even in normal times struggle with basic needs like food, housing, child care, and transportation. (PHOTO: Erin Clark/The Boston Globe via Getty Images)American students could be affectedThe potential shortfall in tuition revenue from international students could also hurt domestic students.When paired with the fact that international student enrollments at U.S. universities has been declining, it\u2019s evident why college leaders like Brown are worried \u2014 so much so that the school took on an insurance policy that hedged against a drop in Chinese students.American colleges \u201chave come to rely on international students, who pay a lot more in tuition than domestic students, [and]\u2026 a lot of those dollars go directly to support scholarships for U.S. residents,\u201d Brown explained. \u201cIf that dries up, that\u2019s less money we have to support our own in-state students from a scholarship standpoint.\u201dWhile some students opt to stay in the U.S. to work after graduation \u2014 using optional practical training (OPT), another aspect of immigration that\u2019s currently under fire \u2014 others return home. H1-B visas, another type of visa used by graduates who seek to immigrate to the U.S., are also facing tighter restrictions by the Trump administration.Experts and business leaders have also slammed that policy, warning that restrictions may hurt long-term U.S. economic growth.Potential loss of competitivenessThe move could also hurt the brand value of the U.S. higher education overall. For instance, international students may look to Canada or Australia or even the UK \u2014 despite Brexit challenges \u2014 to pursue higher education.A graduating student from Columbia University. (PHOTO: REUTERS/Andrew Kelly)Nay, the college student from Chicago, said if she were applying to colleges now, she\u2019d consider going to Australia or elsewhere \u2014 not the U.S. \u201cObviously, I want to study in a place where we feel protected and where we feel valued,\u201d she said. \u201cI just feel very unprotected and very devalued right now as a student, as a human being.\u201dStudents who were preparing to come to the U.S. for the first time feel disappointed.A UK student, who wanted to remain anonymous as her visa is still being processed, said: \u201cTo say I was devastated was a bit of an under statement...This had a sizable impact on my motivation to study and my general well-being.\u201d\u2018We will sue\u2019In the meantime, state attorneys general are observing the events closely.\u201cWe\u2019ll watch what the Trump Administration does, not what it says. As the pandemic ensues, it\u2019s particularly disappointing to hear the administration would risk education possibilities for students who worked to earn the chance to study here,\u201d California Attorney General Xavier Becerra told Yahoo Finance. \u201cKeep in mind: there\u2019s no way to know yet what fall will look like as we confront this public health crisis of historic proportions \u2014 across schools and states nationwide.\u201dCantwell raised the possibility that the administration may walk back the policy. \u201cWe have seen this pattern over and over again with the Trump administration and immigration policy where they sort of float a draconian idea and then implement a slightly less restrictive idea,\u201d he said.But across the country, another attorneys general has stated their intention to sue the administration over the move.\u201cNot on my watch,\u201d Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey tweeted on Tuesday night. \u201cThis is just another cruel (& illegal) attempt by the Trump Admin & ICE to stir up uncertainty & punish immigrants. Our state is home to thousands of international students who shouldn\u2019t fear deportation or health risks in order to get an education.\u201dShe added: \u201cWe will sue.\u201dHarvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology filed a lawsuit on Wednesday morning asking. a federal court to temporarily block the Trump administration\u2019s rule barring international students from living in the country while taking online courses.\u2014Aarthi Swaminathan is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering education.
