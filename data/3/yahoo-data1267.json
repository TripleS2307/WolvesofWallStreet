The latter has taken on a fresh urgency as the next presidential election rapidly approaches.Over the past two months, a slew of major corporations have pulled advertisements off Facebook\u2019s platforms in protest of the company\u2019s complacency in leaving hate speech and deceptive posts unlabeled and available on its site. More than 1,000 companies and organizations including Unilever, Clorox, Coca-Cola, Conagra Brands and Ford Motor have so far participated in the boycott, which is set to run through at least July.Story continuesStill, Facebook said Thursday that in the first three weeks of July, the company\u2019s year over year ad revenue growth rate was approximately in line with its 2020 year-over-year ad revenue growth rate of 10%.\u201cWe expect our full quarter year-over-year ad revenue growth rate for the third quarter of 2020 will be roughly similar to this July performance,\u201d Facebook said in a statement.Facebook executives met with representatives of the Anti-Defamation League and National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in early July to address their concerns over Facebook\u2019s lax policies around problematic posts, though the meeting was later described as insufficient in furthering any changes to the platform.However, the advertisers participating in the boycott represent just a a sliver of the more than 7 million advertisers Facebook has globally, with many of these comprising small businesses that rely on the platform for direct response marketing.Meanwhile, on Wednesday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg appeared before Congress alongside the CEOs of Amazon, Apple and Alphabet to address worries over Big Techs\u2019 competitive tactics. Zuckerberg endured an especially pointed line of questioning from Rep. Jerry Nadler (D., NY), who contended that documents obtained by the US House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust showed Facebook purchased Instagram in 2012 to take out a potential business threat, in an \u201canticompetitive acquisition that antitrust laws were intended to prevent,\u201d Nadler said.On a broader scale, social media advertising platforms as a whole faced a tougher business landscape during the second quarter, with the coronavirus pandemic and business disruptions leading a host of companies to cut back on marketing spending. Earlier this month, Twitter reported a 23% drop in advertising revenue due to the pandemic, while Snap\u2019s revenue growth decelerated to 17% in the second quarter, down sharply from the 44% growth in the first three months of the year.Facebook\u2019s 10% advertising revenue growth during the second quarter represented a slowdown from the 17% increase during the first quarter this year.Still, many investors have viewed internet and software names as relatively more insulated from the direct impacts of the coronavirus pandemic and related shutdowns, with tech names largely outperforming the broader market. Shares of Facebook have risen about 14% for the year to date, outperforming the broader market\u2019s 0.5% increase.This post is breaking.
