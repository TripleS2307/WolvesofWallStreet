He added that the company was likely to favour a single-jab approach, although a final decision on whether a booster would be needed had not yet been made.ETHICAL ISSUESOutcomes of large-scale, or Phase III, trials will depend on the incidence of infections, Van Hoof said, with faster results expected with higher virus transmission.That is why J&J is likely to conduct those trials in the United States and Latin America, the world's regions currently with the highest number of cases.Story continuesIf infections drop significantly, J&J is also considering so-called challenge trials, in which volunteers are infected with the virus so that a vaccine candidate can be tested on them.\"We are looking into that possibility,\" Van Hoof said, noting though that such trials posed ethical issues that needed to be resolved before they could be conducted. For instance, an effective therapy against the disease should be available to minimise risks for volunteers exposed to the virus.In May British drugmaker AstraZeneca, which is developing a leading coronavirus vaccine with Oxford University, said it was too early to deliberately expose trial participants to the pathogen, but that may become an option if ongoing tests hit a snag.Van Hoof said that preparations to stock the virus for possible challenge trials were already underway and J&J was part of ongoing discussions with universities and other bodies involved in these projects.\"We find it a very interesting idea,\" he said, adding however, that setting up facilities for such trials would perhaps take longer than testing vaccines on people who are already infected in the community - as long as transmission remained relatively high.(Reporting by Francesco Guarascio; editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise)"}]}
