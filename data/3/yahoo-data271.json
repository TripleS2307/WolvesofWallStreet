The rising stakes have spotlighted the increasingly urgent search for an effective coronavirus vaccine, which entered a new phase on Monday as biotech upstart Moderna began a Phase 3 human trial, with the help of funding from the U.S. government.With Congress and the White House debating the outline of a new stimulus package that is expected to cost another $1 trillion, the crisis hit close to home as President Donald Trump\u2019s National Security Advisor, Robert O\u2019Brien was revealed on Monday to have tested positive for the virus.Meanwhile, World Health Organization director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus is reconvening an emergency committee later this week to evaluate the pandemic \u2014 the sixth ever in the organization\u2019s history\u2014 and the need to continue the public health emergency status of the coronavirus outbreak.\"When I declared a public health emergency of international concern on the 30th of January \u2013 the highest level of alarm under international law \u2013 there were less than 100 COVID-19 cases outside of China, and no deaths,\u201d Ghebreyesus said Monday during a media briefing.Now, cases across the world have surpassed 16 million \u2014 a number that doubled in just six weeks, according to WHO data.Cases are surging in countries like China and Argentina. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)Vaccine race heats upThe global vaccine race passed a milestone on Monday, with Moderna (MRNA) entering into the third phase of clinical trials, and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) beginning the first phase for its candidate.Globally, other candidates are further along, including China\u2019s candidates with CanSino and Sinopharm, as well as the U.K. with Oxford University\u2019s vaccine \u2014 in partnership with AstraZeneca (AZN).Story continuesModerna\u2019s trial was boosted by a new round of $472 million in federal funding to test the 100 microgram two-shot vaccine dose on 30,000 participants. CEO St\u00e9phane Bancel told Yahoo Finance Monday the company had considered a 10,000-person Phase 3 in April, before the additional funding.Currently, federal support for Moderna is now close to $1 billion. But the record-holder remains Novavax (NVAX), which received $1.6 billion in addition to $60 million from the Department of Defense.The need for a vaccine will dictate the global economy\u2019s effort to return to some level of normalcy, especially as developing countries struggle to battle the outbreak. The need for billions of doses \u2014 including the manufacturing, transporting and delivery\u2014 are all looming obstacles for companies responding to the challenge.Additionally, shortages of necessary equipment persist in the U.S., including personal protective gear, testing supplies, as well as household items like disinfectants, wipes and hand sanitizer.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a new warning Monday to highlight makeshift hand sanitizers finding their way on the market, despite including dangerous chemicals like methanol.\u201cMethanol is not an acceptable ingredient for hand sanitizers and must not be used due to its toxic effects,\u201d the FDA said in a statement. The regulatory body previously warned against such products in early July.And with cases surging in various parts of the U.S., remote working remains the norm across Corporate America. On Monday, Google announced its voluntary return to work program will be extended until June 30 of next year, according to a memo from CEO Sundar Pichai. The company has already reopened several offices worldwide, especially in countries that have successfully reopened.Separately, Major League Baseball (MLB) postponed two games Monday due to players and coaches on some teams testing positive for COVID-19. The league had just started the modified season late last week, with hopes to complete the shortened season.Yahoo Finance\u2019s The Market Wake-UpAnjalee Khemlani is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
