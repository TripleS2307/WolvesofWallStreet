Biden spent eight years as Obama\u2019s vice president and 36 years in the U.S. Senate.When he became U.S. Senator, some current lawmakers, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (D-NY) and Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), weren\u2019t even born. His long history in Washington could be both an asset and a liability.Obama, one of the most popular figures in the Democratic party, has called selecting Biden as VP the best decision he made as the nominee \u2013 but Biden has had to answer for some of his decisions earlier in his career.He presided over the Anita Hill hearing in 1991, in which Hill accused then Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment. Knowing the hearing would be a problem, Biden spoke to Hill last year and expressed regret \u2013 but Hill told the New York Times she was unsatisfied with the conversation.Biden helped write the controversial 1994 crime bill and voted to authorize use of force in Iraq \u2013 both of which his opponents used against him on the debate stage during the primary.The former vice president has also faced accusations of inappropriate behavior toward women. He addressed the claims in April.\u201cI hear what they're saying, I understand it. And I'll be much more mindful. That's my responsibility,\u201d said Biden in a video released by his campaign.If elected, Biden would be 78 at his inauguration. He would become the oldest person to ever take office \u2013 a title currently held by President Trump, who assumed the presidency at 70 years old.Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden and his running mate Sen.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)Biden argues his decades of experience make him uniquely qualified to lead a nation in turmoil. The former vice president has already faced a pandemic and helped lead the country out of a recession.\u201cYou know what it\u2019s like, as much as anybody, to be in the White House during a crisis,\u201d said former President Barack Obama in a conversation with Biden earlier this year.Biden is running on the legacy of the Obama-Biden administration. He helped get the Affordable Care Act over the finish line and now he says he wants to expand access to healthcare by building on Obama\u2019s signature legislation.Story continuesThe former vice president is a moderate Democrat who says he will raise taxes on corporations (higher than the current rate, but lower than before the 2017 tax cuts), invest in education and boost American manufacturing. He touts his relationships with world leaders and argues he\u2019ll need to rebuild America\u2019s standing abroad.Biden entered the race last year, calling this election the battle for the soul of the nation.\u201cIf we give Donald Trump 8 years in the White House he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation,\u201d Biden said in his announcement video.This isn\u2019t the first time Biden has run for president of the United States. He first tried in 1988 and then again 20 years later. He considered it in 2016, but opted out as he grieved the loss of his son, Beau.His late son, at least in part, led him to his current running mate: Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA).Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden joined by his running mate Sen.

Kamala in California, and Beau here in Delaware. Big fights that helped change our entire country. I know how much Beau respected Kamala and her work. And that mattered a lot to me as I made this decision,\u201d Biden said as he introduced Harris for the first time.Biden had vowed to pick a woman as his number two and his choice made history. Harris, the daughter of immigrants, is the first Black woman and first Asian-American to appear on a major party\u2019s presidential ticket.If elected, Biden has pledged to make another historic decision: he would name a Black woman to the Supreme Court should an opening arise.Biden has not thrilled the next generation of progressives \u2013 they\u2019ve urged him to think bigger on climate change, healthcare and racial justice. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has worked with the Biden campaign to push some of his policies to the left. Still, with less than three months to go, Biden is pitching himself to voters as an experienced and steady leader who can guide the country out of crisis.The Yahoo Finance DNC Special will be led by editor in chief Andy Serwer along with Rick Newman, Jessica Smith and Kristin Myers.
