(AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)More than three-quarters (76%) of survey respondents acknowledged that systemic racism is a problem in America in the wake of Blake\u2019s shooting, a 5-point increase from survey results prior to his shooting.The greatest increase in awareness of racism in the country was among respondents who identified as Republicans \u2013 57% \u2013 a 12-point jump the week of Aug. 28 from the week of Aug. 21 (before Blake\u2019s shooting). That compares with a 2-point increase among the 93% of Democrats who said systemic racism exists in the U.S. over that same period.Story continuesIn a previous report conducted by Edelman about two weeks after the death of George Floyd in May, 63% of Americans indicated they were concerned about systemic racism. Only 40% of Republicans were, compared to 84% of Democrats. (Edelman surveyed 2,000 respondents from June 5-7).\u201cI think that systemic racism is the cancer of our society and I hope that people just process that when they decide whether or not to vote and for whom to vote,\u201d Edelman CEO Richard Edelman told Yahoo Finance.Overall, only 33% of Americans trust the federal government to do what\u2019s right when it comes to responding to the problem of systemic racism, according to the report. \u201cGovernment at the moment is in its sort of low ebb because of politics,\u201d said Edelman.While most Americans do not trust the federal government on its racism response, 71% of people say their employer is the only institution they trust to do what\u2019s right. However, most Americans believe that employers have a lot of work to do to address racism.\u201cThat\u2019s a big clue for all the companies in the country where [Americans] are looking for you to fix your supply chain, to make sure that you\u2019ve got diverse population within your executive ranks, that you\u2019re doing everything you can to offer financing to small business, and making sure that the people who are in community of color in this country feel as if they\u2019re being properly treated at work,\u201d said Edelman.According to the report, 58% of Americans see some amount of racism in their workplace.\u201cSeventy-five percent of the African Americans who we studied said they\u2019ve had experience with racism in their company. That\u2019s shocking. It\u2019s not supposed to be,\u201d said Edelman.More from Sibile:We\u2019ll \u2018have a way\u2019 to ban fracking in Biden administration: Sierra ClubJob cuts come for white-collar workers: \u2018There are no truly recession-proof\u2019 occupationsThe Trump payroll tax break you won\u2019t see on your paycheck\u2018Ghosting\u2019 is not just for lovers.
