The brand on Wednesday said it will retire the Uncle Ben character, long criticized as racist since \u201cuncle\u201d was a derogatory term white people would use for black men in the Jim Crow era.Mars Inc said, \u201cNow is the right time to evolve the brand... We don't yet know what the exact changes or timing will be, but we are evaluating all possibilities.\u201d (UPDATE, Sept. 23, 2020: Mars scrubbed the Ben image from its packaging and changed the name to \u201cBen\u2019s Original.\u201d)Mrs. Butterworth\u2019s and Cream of Wheat came next. Both products use logos based on black stereotypes.Conagra Brands (CAG), owner of Mrs. Butterworth\u2019s, said on Wednesday it is initiating a \u201ccomplete brand and packaging review on Mrs. Butterworth's.\u201d B&G Foods, owner of Cream of Wheat\u2014which bears a smiling black chef on the box who is based on a racist caricature from minstrel shows\u2014said, \u201cWe understand there are concerns regarding the Chef image, and we are committed to evaluating our packaging and will proactively take steps to ensure that we and our brands do not inadvertently contribute to systemic racism.\u201dStory continuesOn Thursday, Colgate-Palmolive joined the discussion. The company jointly owns Darlie, one of the leading toothpaste brands in China, and now says it is \u201cworking with our partner to review and further evolve all aspects of the brand, including the brand name.\u201d Darlie was called Darkie until 1989 and featured on its package a grinning black caricature in a top hat.Land O\u2019Lakes, member-owned and based in Minnesota, made its move in April.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Of course, these companies already knew the problems with these logos, and have known for years. A few years ago, Quaker even removed the kerchief from Aunt Jemima in response to criticism, and added pearl earrings and a white collar.As such, there is a touch of the disingenuous in these rebrands, since they prompt the question: Why did it take so long? And, would these brands have taken these actions without the social media backlash forcing their hand? The moves tend to look reactive rather than proactive.It isn\u2019t just consumer products. The popular Grammy-winning country band Lady Antebellum announced this month that the band will change its name to Lady A, dropping the \u201cAntebellum.\u201d The band said in a statement, in part, \u201cWe named our band after the Southern \u2018antebellum\u2019 style home where we took our first photos.... We did not take into account the associations that weigh down this word referring to the period of history before the Civil War, which includes slavery. We are deeply sorry for the hurt this has caused.\u201dThe band\u2019s statement also addressed the \u201cwhy now\u201d and \u201cwhy not sooner\u201d questions that can arise from many of these new rebrands: \u201cWe understand that many of you may ask the question \u2018Why have you not made this change until now?\u2019 The answer is that we can make no excuse for our lateness to this realization. What we can do is acknowledge it, turn from it, and take action.\u201dTODAY -- Pictured: (l-r) Hillary Scott of Lady Antebellum, Dave Haywood on Friday, November 15, 2019 -- (Photo by: Nathan Congleton/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images)And the tide of change is hitting sports.Nascar banned Confederate flags at all of its events just two days after its only current full-time black driver called for the ban. In the NFL, the kneeling protests that Colin Kaepernick started in 2016 are expected to return, and the league will reportedly allow and support them, a reversal from four years ago. On June 5, just two days after New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees set off a national firestorm when he told Yahoo Finance he will \u201cnever agree with anybody disrespecting the flag,\u201d NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell released a video in which he said, \u201cWe the NFL admit we were wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier, and encourage all to speak out and peacefully protest.\u201d The Goodell video was reportedly a direct result of a \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d video that featured a number of NFL stars, including last season\u2019s Super Bowl MVP Patrick Mahomes.Now a range of players and coaches have already said they plan to kneel during the national anthem this coming NFL season.Next, it\u2019s reasonable to wonder if the reckoning might hit team names and mascots long criticized as racist, including most notably the Washington Redskins.(This post will be updated as more rebrands are announced.)\u2014Daniel Roberts is an editor-at-large at Yahoo Finance.
