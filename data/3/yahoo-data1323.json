The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in D.C.\u201cBetsy DeVos\u2019s unjustified and illegal repeal of the Gainful Employment rule is yet another example of the Trump Administration\u2019s continued efforts to dismantle critical safeguards protecting students and taxpayers in order to further the interests of for-profit colleges,\u201d New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement.U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos testifies before the House Education Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., May 22, 2018.

The Trump administration\u2019s actions here are just another example of putting special interests ahead of student interests.\u201dIn response to the lawsuit, press secretary Angela Morabito stated simply: \u201cThe Department will vigorously defend its final regulation rescinding this deeply flawed rule.\u201dAdvocates expect the latest lawsuit to generate momentum to reverse the rule, or create more accountability measures.\u201cNow more than ever, students need to know that their investment in higher education will lead to a brighter economic future,\u201d Student Defense President Aaron Ament said in a statement. \u201cSecretary DeVos\u2019s illegal repeal of the Gainful Employment Rule is a betrayal of students and a handout to owners of predatory schools.\u201dStory continuesRandi Weingarten, president of the teachers\u2019 union American Federation of Teachers, added: \u201cBetsy DeVos has already made history as one of the most unproductive, unpopular and frankly embarrassing cabinet appointments \u2014 and today, states across the country are holding her to account.\u201d\u2018Leaving the Department without any meaningful way to enforce\u2019The for-profit higher education sector saw tremendous growth after the 2008 Crisis. In 2016, the New York Fed noted that enrollment at these schools had \u201cskyrocketed\u201d as the country emerged out of the Great Recession.Debt levels rose ballooned over the following decade, and students graduating from for-profit institutions generally hold far higher levels of debt than those attending other institutions.(Graphic: David Foster)The gainful employment rule addressed this imbalance by requiring schools\u2019 graduates to have loan payments that were less than 8% of their total income or 20% of their discretionary income, as The New York Times explained in 2014.The Obama-era ED estimated that as of 2014, 1,400 programs serving 840,000 students \u2014 99% of whom were at for-profit institutions \u2014 would not pass the accountability standards under the gainful employment rule. By 2020, the Trump-era ED defended its repeal of the rule.Attorneys general of several states and others pushed back on the repeal, stating that the move made it much easier for predatory for-profit institutions to exploit students.A security guard inside Everest College keeps away a member of the media and a former student after the embattled for-profit Santa Ana school was shut down along with 28 others.

In January 2020, the country\u2019s second-largest teachers\u2019 union sued DeVos for reversing the gainful employment rule. And California Attorney General Becerra, who is not part of the new lawsuit, also brought a lawsuit against DeVos for overturning the rule.\u201cThe Repeal Rule eliminated the standard employed under the GE Rule to evaluate whether programs prepared students for gainful employment ... did away with the warnings that failing programs owed to current and prospective students ... [and] did not create any replacement mechanisms, leaving the Department without any meaningful way to enforce the gainful employment provision,\u201d the lawsuit stated.Reversal allows \u2018for-profit schools to steer students into useless programs\u2019The attorneys general also expressed concerns over a possible resurgence in the for-profit education sector amid the coronavirus-induced recession.\u201cBefore the GE Rule, scores of students took on loans to enroll in programs that offered a worthless education, a key contributor to a national student debt crisis. In egregious cases, students\u2019 harmful enrollment decisions were the consequence of unscrupulous recruiting practices by predatory for-profit institutions,\u201d they stated in the lawsuit.\u201cIn the current economic downturn, there is a large pool of people eager to pursue educational opportunities that will help advance or restart their career,\u201d the lawsuit added. \u201cBut with the Repeal Rule, the Department has reverted to the conditions that allowed for-profit schools to steer students into useless programs.\u201dThere are over 2.3 million coronavirus cases in the U.S. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)And due to the fact that ED has not replaced the gainful employment rule with an alternative, they argued, the repeal is \u201carbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.\u201d\u201cWith the economic downturn causing many of our residents to reevaluate their careers and consider returning to school, it\u2019s hard to imagine a worse time to eliminate protections for students who are seeking to improve their job prospects,\u201d New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal said in a statement. \u201cYet the U.S. Department of Education is doing just that, so that it can send more taxpayer money to for-profit schools that push high-cost, low-value educational programs and saddle students with unaffordable debt.\u201d\u2014Aarthi is a writer for Yahoo Finance.
