We need a program that makes every American an owner of the compounding growth in value of corporate America,\u201d the investor wrote.\u201cCompounded returns over time are indeed one of the great wonders of the world, and every day we wait to address this issue, the problem looms larger,\"he added.Staving off a \u2018turn toward Socialism\u2019Specifically, the 54-year-old activist investor suggested that the government create investment accounts for every baby born in the U.S. that would invest in no-fee stock index funds, and withdrawal from those funds wouldn't be allowed until retirement.\" Without funds to invest for retirement \u2013 particularly after the housing crash destroyed many Americans' only other source of long-term wealth creation \u2013 one has almost no hope to build wealth for retirement, or to give the next generation a head's start,\" Ackman added.Story continuesAccording to Ackman, assuming a rate of 8% per year, investing $6,750 in an account at birth would yield assets of more than $1 million by age 65. It would cost the government $26 billion per year, based on the average number of children born in the U.S.In addition, the billionaire suggested that companies should be required to put a fixed percentage of a worker\u2019s salary or wages in a tax-free investment account that couldn't be touched until retirement. In that way, it would mimic Australia\u2019s successful superannuation system.He also advocated for financial literacy, which is just as important as access to investing.According to Ackman, the American Dream \"has become a disappointment or worse for far too many.\" He added that if capitalism continues to leave people behind and wage growth lags, Americans will \"seek changes, potentially radical ones, to the current system, or seek an alternative system.\"Ackman wrote that solving the wealth divide is incumbent upon everyone, especially the capitalist system's greatest beneficiaries.\"Like those who rent rather than own their homes and thereby have no love lost for their landlords, Americans that have no ownership in the success of capitalism, and who are suffering economically, are more motivated to turn toward Socialism or other alternatives,\" the investor wrote.Pershing Square Holdings, Ackman's hedge fund firm's publicly-traded vehicle, is up 44.1% year-to-date, far outpacing the broader market.Julia La Roche is a Correspondent for Yahoo Finance.
