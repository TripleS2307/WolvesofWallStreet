And one thing was confirmed for many market watchers: A Biden presidency may not be so great for stock prices.\u201cBiden will ensure that corporate America finally pays their fair share in taxes, puts their workers and communities first rather than their shareholders, and respects their workers\u2019 power and voice in the workplace,\u201d a Biden campaign email memo wrote Thursday. Titled \u201cBuild Back Better,\u201d the plan is in line with many traditional Democratic efforts around expanded social safety nets and infrastructure investments.To help pay for it all, Biden is keen on reversing President\u2019s Trump\u2019s signature corporate taxes to businesses that prior to the pandemic, had helped send stock prices to record highs.\u201cHe will pay for the ongoing costs of the plan by reversing some of Trump\u2019s tax cuts for corporations and imposing common-sense tax reforms that finally make sure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share,\u201d the memo outlined in bolded font.The former vice president has put forth reversing half of the president\u2019s signature tax cuts, lifting the statutory rate to 28%. Investment bank Credit Suisse estimates this change in taxes would increase the effective rate by 4% to 5%, and slash $9 off estimated S&P 500 earnings per share. Goldman Sachs has projected that Biden\u2019s tax plan would lead it to reduce its 2021 earnings estimate by 12%.Democratic presidential candidate, former Vice President Joe Biden speaks at Alexis Dupont High School in Wilmington, Del., Tuesday, June 30, 2020. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)Theoretically, those estimate revisions would put marked pressure on stock prices.\u201cThere\u2019s a problem. It\u2019s all after-tax. That\u2019s unfortunate but at the end of the day, the money you put in your pocket is after-tax. You need to put more money in your pocket. It [the Biden plan] means that stocks \u2014 all things being equal \u2014 would be lower by 25% than they are today. It may not work that way. That is at least the theory,\u201d explained SMH Group CEO George Ball on Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade.Story continuesBall isn\u2019t alone on the Street in thinking Biden is bad for markets.\u201cCertainly Biden\u2019s tax plan is a headwind for the market,\u201d said Momentum Advisors chief investment officer Allan Boomer on The First Trade. \u201cI estimate that if the corporate tax rate goes up, it could bring down S&P 500 earnings by about 10%. The market is overbought for a lot of reasons. Politics is one headwind. Clearly what is happening with Covid is a headwind. So I think the tax issue with Biden is just one.\u201dOne that this rally stock market has overlooked, but perhaps not for long.Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
