But many were quick to note that the pace of recovery has slowed when compared with record reports in June and May.Joseph LaVorgna, an advisor to President Trump and chief economist at the National Economic Council, told Yahoo Finance that claims about a broader economic slowing are \u201cvery misleading.\u201dThe resurgence of coronavirus cases in some states weighed on the labor market recovery as some federal stimulus measures also have run out. \u201cIt has slowed\u201d this month, LaVorgna said, but \u201cit\u2019s not to say that it won\u2019t reaccelerate for a couple of reasons.\u201d\u201cIt's very hard to say what the next report's going to look like, but for us to assume, just because we've had some very good numbers that surprised everybody, we are supposed to look for a big deceleration \u2013 that may not happen,\" LaVorgna says.A help wanted sign is displayed in the window of a Brooklyn business. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images)LaVorgna pointed to metrics like potential revisions in the month ahead and temporary hiring, calling it a \u201cforward looking indicator of labor demand\u201d that he noted was up. President Trump responded to the announcement, tweeting \u201cGreat Jobs Numbers!\u201dThe Democratic response to the numbers was a bit different. In a call with reporters Friday, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez returned repeatedly to the slowing pace of job growth. He also pointed out that 5 million people have left the labor force since February and so the unemployment rate, which now sits at 10.2%, isn\u2019t as low as it seems. \u201cThey have given up,\u201d Perez said of these workers. (In order to be counted in the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 measure of unemployment \u2013 to be \u201cofficially\u201d unemployed \u2013 you have to be actively looking for work, which many out-of-work people have likely stopped doing.)Great Jobs Numbers!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 7, 2020The Trump campaign also jumped in with official notes that the 1.8 million new jobs \u2013 while below the June report \u2013 represent the third-largest jobs gain in American history after the May and June numbers. Left out, of course, were the horrific reports that preceded it, including an April report that saw over 20 million jobs lost, by far the worst in U.S. history.Story continuesTrump, at each stage of the ongoing recession caused by the pandemic, has promised that the U.S. economy will come back stronger than ever. Last month, after the report showed a 4.8 million jobs added, the president said the announcement proved \u201cthat our economy is roaring back.\"LaVorgna echoed the president\u2019s assessment in the wake of the new numbers. He also played down the need for more stimulus as negotiations have faltered (he said it was separate and called it an \u201cinsurance policy\u201d).\u201cThe economy is already jumpstarted,\u201d he said, predicting GDP growth at an annualized rate of 20% in the second half of 2020. LaVorgna also forecast that all or most of the lost jobs would return with a clear caveat: \u201cif we stay on the course that the president has laid out.\u201dThe remarks came with only two more jobs reports scheduled to be released between now and the November election.Ben Werschkul is a producer for Yahoo Finance in Washington, DC.Read more:July jobs report: Economy added back 1.763 million payrolls in July, unemployment rate fell to 10.2%Stocks open lower, July jobs report surprises to the upsideRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit."}]}
