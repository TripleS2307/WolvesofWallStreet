Last week, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated its forecast, anticipating a total of 207,000 to 218,00 deaths by the week ending October 10.Back in April, the milestone was one that Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), was optimistic the U.S. could avoid. \u201cI don\u2019t accept every day that we\u2019re going to have to have 100- to 200,000 deaths. I think we can really bring that down,\u201d he said then.But without a cohesive national strategy to curb the outbreak, and amid breakdowns in social distancing and other mitigation strategies in parts of the country, experts have warned the virus is going to continue to impact the U.S. for some time.White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany defended President Donald Trump\u2019s response on Tuesday, as the president comes under increasingly withering criticism about his handling of the crisis. McEnany insisted Trump did not downplay the outbreak or keep critical information from the public, something he admitted doing to Washington Post editor Bob Woodward in a recorded call earlier this year.\u201cThe fact that we have come nowhere near [2 million deaths] is a testament to this President taking immediate action,\u201d she said, referring to initial models that projected up to that many fatalities.As Trump continues to ramp up expectations of an effective inoculation before year\u2019s end, The Washington Post reported late Tuesday that the Food and Drug Administration is expected to outline a tougher standard toward emergency approval of any vaccine \u2014 making it unlikely to meet the Election Day deadline suggested by the president and others.Story continuesWith experts worried that a rushed development process will undermine the public\u2019s faith in a vaccine, The Post reported that FDA officials are moving to address that with more transparency and strict guidelines for approval of any cure.The U.S. has now surpassed 200,000 deaths from coronavirus. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)Europe not much betterEuropean countries face new restrictions as parts of the continent see surges in cases, some marking a second wave of the outbreak.France reported more than 10,000 cases Sunday, and Britain reported nearly 4,000. As a result, the U.K. government is imposing new restrictions it says will likely last for the next six months.Those restrictions include closing pubs by 10 p.m. and encouraging work from home, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Tuesday.\u201cWe will spare no effort in developing vaccines, treatments and new forms of mass testing, but unless we palpably make progress, we should assume that the restrictions I have announced will remain in place for perhaps six months,\u201d he said.Fall and winter months in the Northern Hemisphere have been expected to result in a second wave of the virus, as the world waits for a vaccine to be approved.The global coalition for a vaccine, COVAX Facility, which includes the world\u2019s top public health, vaccine and philanthropic entities, announced Monday it has the support of 64 high-income countries.But some of the world\u2019s largest economies are notably absent, including the U.S., Russia and China. Beijing and Moscow have already authorized vaccines being distributed to their populations.\u201cVaccine nationalism will only perpetuate the disease and prolong the global recovery. Working together through the COVAX Facility is not charity, it\u2019s in every country\u2019s own best interests to control the pandemic and accelerate the global economic recovery,\u201d said WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.Despite the U.S.\u2019s absence, the global scientific community remains in communication about best practices, as evidenced by presentations during the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) meeting Tuesday.ACIP will be advising the CDC on the proper strategy to roll out a vaccine once it is authorized or approved. Two leading contenders, Moderna (MRNA) and Pfizer (PFE) along with BioNTech (BNTX), expect initial readings of their vaccine\u2019s safety by earliest end of October or into November.More from Anjalee:Redfield: CDC 'preparing earnestly' for vaccine in November, DecemberIndia's tech giants navigate 'literally spiking' WFH demand, H1-B fears in coronavirus eraHow protests spurred Corporate America into action on race, inequalityRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube."}]}
