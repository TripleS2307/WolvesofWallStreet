But Rosengren has struck a more pessimistic tone, saying in a speech last week that efforts in the United States to contain the virus \u201chave not been particularly successful.\u201dRosengren warned of the risk in reopening the economy too quickly, expressing further worry that a relaxation of social distancing measures will only lead to more flare-ups of the virus. The Boston Fed chief added that positive headlines may be masking the health implications of loosening restrictions.In states that moved early to re-open, such as Florida and Arizona, hospitalizations have spiked.\u201cSome of the better economic data we've been getting has reflected the fact that those places are opening up, but they may not be opening up as safely as they need to,\u201d Rosengren said.Rosengren\u2019s forecasts for the U.S. economy are gloomier than those of his colleagues on the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meeting. In the FOMC\u2019s June 10 meeting, the median committee member projected a 9.3% unemployment rate by the end of 2020 with real GDP contracting by 6.5% for the year.Rosengren, however, expects the headline unemployment rate to end the year in double digits with GDP contraction coming in \u201ca little bit worse\u201d than the FOMC\u2019s median projection.Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren, left, speaks during a round table discussion at Silver Lane Elementary School, in East Hartford, Conn. (AP Photo/Steven Senne, file)Fed policyWith no control of the public health response, the Fed has been leveraging its monetary policy and emergency lending tools to avoid a financial crisis.Story continuesAfter having already slashed interest rates to near-zero in mid-March, the FOMC messaged in its June 10 meeting that the Fed is unlikely to raise rates before the end of 2022.Rosengren said the Fed is a \u201clong way from raising rates\u201d and said the central bank hopes to keep short-term and long-term borrowing costs \u201cquite accommodative.\u201dThe focus has instead shifted to the Fed\u2019s ballooning balance sheet, which breached $7 trillion amid a breakneck pace of asset purchases targeting mortgage-backed securities and U.S. Treasuries. Although those purchases have slowed over the last few weeks, the Fed has committed to \u201cincrease its holdings\u201d over the coming months.The Fed has also opened up eleven liquidity facilities designed to backstop several financial markets, ranging from the international flow of U.S. dollars to the domestic corporate bond market.The Boston Fed has been tasked with setting up one cornerstone of the Fed\u2019s crisis response: a Main Street Lending Program offering loans to small and medium-sized businesses. Although announced in late March, the Fed only opened its program for lender registration last Monday.Rosengren said over 200 financial institutions had registered as of last week, adding that lenders should be able to clear the process in two or three days before getting the green light to extend the loans. Rosengren said the Fed will \u201cin the next couple weeks\u201d set up its facility that will purchase 95% of each loan from the underwriting lender.\u201cEvery one of these loans is presumably a loan that, without the Federal Reserve intervention, the bank wouldn't have been that willing to do,\u201d Rosengren said.Rosengren said that if the economy rebounds quickly, the Fed \u201cideally\u201d would not need to use the facility at all. But with a baseline expectation of a difficult second half of 2020, Rosengren says the program will serve as an \u201cimportance insurance policy for the economy.\u201dBrian Cheung is a reporter covering the Fed, economics, and banking for Yahoo Finance.
