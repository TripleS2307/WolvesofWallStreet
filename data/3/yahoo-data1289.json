We all know low mortgage rates have definitely been helping the housing market. Second is the old pent up demand argument,\u201d explained Cortland chief economist Brad Dillman on Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade. Dillman is the former director of research at homebuilder PulteGroup.Dillman adds, \u201cAnd finally, we are seeing new home sales and new supply really starting to come to the market.\u201dThe latest reads on housing \u2014 in large part fueled by the three trends Dillman points out \u2014 have been nothing short of eye-popping.Sales of new homes in July surged to a more than 13-year high, according to data released on Tuesday by The Commerce Department. New home sales rose 13.9% to a seasonally adjusted 901,000 in the month. The data comes on the heels of the National Association of Realtors saying last Friday existing home sales popped 24.7% in July.And earlier last week, the Commerce Department reported housing starts surged 22.6% in July. It marked the best showing since October 2016. Building permits \u2014 long viewed as a leading indicator of housing demand \u2014 spiked 18.8%.In this image from a drone, workers construct a new house elevated with cinder blocks in Stone Harbor, N.J., on Thursday, July 23, 2020. (AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey)Bank of America Merrill Lynch also point to millennials \u2014 no longer keen on renting space in crowded cities amid a pandemic \u2014 buying their first homes as a key driver of demand right now.\u201cThe need for more space and the desire for a lower cost of living were among the top two reasons selected by those wanting to move to a new city/town, each with a 36% overall hit rate. The \"more space\" response was highest among millennials, which is consistent with our view that this cohort will support housing demand over at least the next five years as constituents reach prime home buying age at an accelerated pace and embark upon life events such as marriage/child-rearing,\u201d BofA researchers revealed Tuesday in a new survey.Story continuesThe tailwinds in housing have lit a fire on stocks in the homebuilding, building products and home improvement sectors.Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s are fresh off mind-blowing second quarter earnings reports \u2014 shares are up 18% and 35%, respectively, in the past six months. Sustainable deck maker The Azek Company \u2014 which went public in June \u2014 has seen its stock go up in a straight line since its trading debut as people added decks to their new or existing homes.\u201cComing into the pandemic, we really saw strong sales. After a pause in April and May, we returned to growth. So sales have been steady and actually accelerating as we went into the most recent quarter,\u201d The Azek Company CEO Jesse Singh told Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade.Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
