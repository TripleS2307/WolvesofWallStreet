Homes sold in those ZIP codes in an average of 18 days \u2014 51 days faster than the national average \u2014 thanks to these areas\u2019 accessibility to downtown urban areas, outdoor space, affordability and strong local economies, according to Realtor.com.\u201cEach of these areas have affordable home prices, and that\u2019s really helping to draw buyers in. And because buyers are interested in that affordability, homes in these ZIP codes are selling fast,\u201d said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com.Colorado Springs was the hottest market in the U.S. this year, according to Realtor.com.First-time millennial homebuyers (ages 22 to 38) were the main drivers of hot real estate markets, comprising 53% of buyers in the best-selling markets, compared to 43% in the rest of the U.S. Millennials prioritize affordability and adequate square footage, driving them to suburban and secondary markets \u2014 and the coronavirus pandemic has made large homes and yard space even more attractive, said Hale.\u201cAs the largest generation in U.S. history continues to advance toward life milestones \u2014 settling down, marriage, parenthood \u2014 the need for space and affordable housing outshines the bright lights in expensive urban areas like New York or Los Angeles,\u201d said Hale. \u201cNow with this extra time at home, trying to live, work, play [and] do schooling all in the same space, people are even more interested in extra space.\u201d\u201cRochester has done a lot to revitalize its downtown area, so that is appealing to folks who are looking for an area that has big city-like amenities without a lot of the big-city problems,\u201d said Hale.Half of this year\u2019s hottest markets were in Northeastern suburbs, including Rochester, N.Y., Melrose, Mass., South Portland, Maine, Hudson, N.H. and Worcester, Mass. Their popularity was driven by migration from pricey nearby cities, especially New York City and Boston, according to Realtor.com.\u201cThe East Coast really did well this year,\u201d said Hale. \u201cIt\u2019s done a better job of keeping up with building, and that helps homes stay affordable.\u201dStory continuesThe second hottest ZIP code on the market, Reynoldsburg, is near Columbus, Ohio.But America\u2019s renewed love affair with suburban living could push up prices in secondary markets, while dwindling demand for city apartments drove rent prices down to a six-year low, especially in primary markets.\u201cThe rise of [building] multifamily units may lead to an oversupply of apartment buildings, especially in city centers given the evident recent shift in consumer preference for single-family homes in the suburbs,\u201d said a statement by Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors.Shifting housing patterns could become an issue in the coming election, as developers look for new ways to meet demand for affordable housing. President Trump and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson recently wrote an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal, lambasting the \u201cObama-Biden dystopian vision of building low-income housing units next to your suburban house.\u201d\u201cThe crime and chaos in Democrat-run cities have gotten so bad that liberals are even getting out of Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side. Rather than rethink their destructive policies, the left wants to make sure there is no escape,\u201d said the op-ed. \u201cThat\u2019s why we stopped the last administration\u2019s radical social-engineering project that would have transformed the suburbs from the top down.\u201d\"We believe the suburbs offer a wonderful life for Americans of all races and backgrounds when they are allowed to grow organically, from the bottom up,\" read Trump and Carson's op-ed.But demand for suburban living doesn\u2019t mean big cities are going away. Historical patterns show that New York City real estate generally bounces back within three years of a recession or catastrophic event.\u201cThere are a lot of people who still prefer the city. It\u2019s got culture, it\u2019s got night life, it\u2019s got close proximity to everything\u2026 There are lots of reasons to stay in the city depending on what stage of life you\u2019re at,\u201d said Hale.Sarah Paynter is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
