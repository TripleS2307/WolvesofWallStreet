Although the dollar has staved off further declines, forex analysts are warning that a weak U.S. dollar may be here to stay.A year-to-date chart of DX=F (Credit: David Foster / Yahoo Finance)ING\u2019s economics team says that a \u201csignificant bearish factor\u201d for the dollar is the Fed\u2019s intention to allow inflation to \u201cmoderately\u201d overshoot its 2 % target. The framework change means the central bank is likely to hold pat on near-zero interest rates for even longer.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to lose track of chapters in the global currency war, but the Fed\u2019s switch to average inflation targeting certainly looks one of them,\u201d ING wrote September 4.Lower interest rates for longer could mean lower inflows into U.S. dollar-denominated investments. Interest rate differentials (when the return on deposits are greater in one country over another) have narrowed with the Fed now pinning U.S. rates near zero for the foreseeable future. Before COVID-19, the Fed had interest rates noticeably higher than in the Eurozone and Japan, where central banks had been backed into negative interest rates.\u201cMarkets are in broad consensus that low yields will be in play for years to come within the G10 space, meaning the Fed isn\u2019t opening the dollar up to large bouts of pressure,\u201d Monex Europe FX market analyst Simon Harvey told Yahoo Finance.Spillover effectsMorgan Stanley\u2019s global investment committee agrees that a weaker dollar is an \u201cunderappreciated\u201d impact of the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy changes, noting that a weaker dollar may be a means for achieving higher inflation.\u201cA weaker dollar exacerbates inflation because it drives up the cost of imports, especially commodities and consumer goods that are major inputs to US consumption,\u201d Morgan Stanley\u2019s Lisa Shalett wrote September 8.Story continuesAs the world\u2019s reserve currency, the U.S. dollar presents the Fed with a unique challenge: prioritizing domestic monetary policy but maintaining awareness of the spillover effects from dollar dynamics.The Fed has had a close eye on dollar liquidity since the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis. In the spring, the U.S. dollar plunged and then spiked back up amid concerns over a global shortage of dollars. After the Federal Reserve flooded the world with greenbacks through swap lines with 14 other central banks, volatility abated before market factors began pushing the U.S. dollar lower.But a weaker dollar presents other challenges for countries now watching their currencies appreciate (which generally harm exporters). The European Central Bank has watched the Euro rise over 5% against the U.S. dollar since July, prompting ECB President Christine Lagarde to say Thursday that the central bank will \u201ccarefully monitor\u201d the situation.Policymakers abroad may want to buckle in for a long period of dollar weakness. Monex\u2019s Simon Harvey raised the possibility of the dollar rallying sharply once the Fed normalizes policy, but said normalization \u201cwon\u2019t be occurring anytime soon.\u201dThe level of appreciation in other currencies depends on other risk factors. For example, in the United Kingdom, the lingering uncertainty around Brexit has Monex predicting GBP/USD to rise to 1.45 by August 2021. In comparison, Monex predicts more stability in EUR/USD, with a 12-month target of 1.22.As of Sept. 10, the GBP/USD rate was at 1.28 and EUR/USD at 1.18.Brian Cheung is a reporter covering the Fed, economics, and banking for Yahoo Finance.
