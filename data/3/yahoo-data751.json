And while that may be a good deal of money for the individuals bilked out of their funds, the hack could have been far worse.Twitter is already bound by a settlement agreement with the Federal Trade Commission that relates to a 2009 breach under which the social network could face fines if it doesn\u2019t safeguard user data.With Twitter serving as a major news source for everything from financial institutions to weather services, and operating as the de facto bullhorn for President Trump, a hack targeting such high-profile accounts could have been far more disastrous, experts warn.\u201cWe really dodged a bullet that they only stole a little over $100,000 in bitcoin,\u201d said NYU Tandon School of Engineer assistant professor of computer science and engineering Damon McCoy. \u201cIt could have been much, much worse than what happened.\u201dTwitter\u2019s strength in shaping newsTwitter\u2019s importance in breaking international and financial news has come into sharp focus in recent years. Trump regularly makes grand pronouncements on the service, which can either roil or lift markets.Musk, meanwhile, has both sent Tesla\u2019s (TSLA) stock price soaring and plummeting after he\u2019s made statements on Twitter including his famous call that he was going to take Tesla private at $420 a share, for which he was subsequently sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission.Story continuesAccording to McCoy, Twitter has become so entrenched in the lives of traders that major news events can directly impact the markets, giving hackers a greater incentive to attack the social network.\u2018[Hackers could] target a particular company's stock, either make it rise or fall, or even worse, target entire sectors or entire markets with how closely the algorithmic trading and the hedge funds have connected themselves to monitoring social media and how fast they trade these days,\u201d he said.Twitter is still trying to determine how hackers were able to access the accounts of a number of high-profile users including Barack Obama and Elon Musk. (Image: John Nacion)What\u2019s more, nation-state hackers have proven their willingness to exploit Twitter for their own gains. Look no further than the 2016 election meddling campaign Russia waged against the U.S. using Twitter and Facebook.Equally alarming was the time Syrian hackers took over the Associated Press\u2019s Twitter account in 2013 and tweeted that then-president Obama was involved in an explosion at the White House and was injured.\u201cI think this hack definitely exposed that this could be an issue at least at Twitter. The harm was fairly minimal compared to what it could have been,\u201d McCoy said of the latest incident.How Twitter moves forwardFor Twitter, the next step is determining how this hack happened and how it can mitigate future attempts in the future.\u201cThe hardest thing to regain here is the trust of the user population,\u201d explained Professor Dave Levin of the Maryland Cybersecurity Center at the University of Maryland.\u201cFortunately, I mean, Twitter hasn't had a lot of these types of incidents. Whereas a lot of the other tech companies have had things like this happen. A real red flag is when you see things like this happen over and over again.\u201dAccording to Twitter, the hack seems to be the result of some form of social engineering. It\u2019s similar to the tactic attackers use when they send fraudulent emails claiming to be from Google or Microsoft asking you to click a link and enter your username and password then take over your account.Motherboard, however, says that it spoke to individuals claiming to be behind the hack, and that they paid off an insider to give them access to the means to control the high-profile accounts.Both McCoy and Levin expressed their dismay that the attackers were able to thoroughly penetrate Twitter, and said they\u2019ll need to work to ensure similar attacks can\u2019t occur in the future.\u201cThe reason why there are two keys you have to turn in a nuclear submarine at the same time is there is a chance one person will go crazy and you don't want the crazy person to launch nuclear missiles,\u201d Levin said.\u201cIf something is really, really important, having a single person that could have a bad day is not great. You should design systems to have some kind of resilience against those types of attacks,\u201d he said.Got a tip?
