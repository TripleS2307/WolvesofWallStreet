Reach me on Twitter at @danielhowley or email me at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.Now, on to your questions. This week's dilemma:\u201cHow do I delete my Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp accounts?\u201dFacebook (FB) is, once again, mired in a major controversy. The current issue is an ad boycott started by the Stop Hate for Profit campaign, which is, among other things, calling for Facebook to do more to eliminate hate speech on its platform.On Wednesday, Facebook said CEO Mark Zuckerberg is open to meeting with the civil rights groups behind Stop the Hate for Profit including the NAACP, Color of Change, and the Anti-Defamation League to discuss the matter.It\u2019s just the latest in a long string of problems the company has faced, which, after a while, can all be a bit much for some people. Thankfully, if you\u2019re tired of Facebook\u2019s issues, you can quickly delete all of your associated accounts. Here\u2019s how:Saving your old dataBefore you delete Facebook there are a few things to take into account. The first is that without Facebook, you won\u2019t be able to use Messenger. The second is that if you delete your account, you\u2019re also saying goodbye to all of the photos and videos you\u2019ve uploaded to the site over the years.(Image: Facebook)(Image: Facebook)You can, however, download those memories before axing your account. To do that, go into the Facebook Menu and select Settings under Settings & Privacy in the Facebook app.(Image: Facebook)Swipe down to Download Your Information and select the information you want to download, whether that\u2019s your photos and videos or past comments and Likes. It\u2019ll take a bit of time for Facebook to put all of that information together, but when it\u2019s completed, you\u2019ll have access to your data.Story continues(Image: Facebook)If you simply want to transfer your photos and videos to another service, like Google Photos, you can select Settings from the Settings & Privacy menu and swipe down to Transfer a Copy of Your Photos or Videos.(Image: Facebook)You\u2019ll need to enter your password, then select the service you want to transfer your photos and videos to. You\u2019ll also have to provide permission for the transfer by signing into your secondary service, but once you do, you\u2019ll be able to send over your data.You can perform this same set of steps through the main Facebook website via your web browser.Deleting your Facebook accountNow that you\u2019ve backed up your old photos and videos, you can say \u201cso long\u201d to Facebook.To delete your account, navigate to Settings in the Facebook app and select Account Ownership and Control below the Your Facebook Information heading.Choose Deactivation and Deletion, select the box next to Delete Account and tap Continue to Account Deletion.(Image: Facebook)Press Delete Account on the next page, enter your password, and you\u2019re set.If you\u2019re accessing Facebook through your web browser, you\u2019ll need to click the down arrow in the top right corner of the page and select Settings.From there, click Your Facebook Information and then Deactivation and Deletion.Highlight the box next to Permanently Delete Account and select Continue to Account Deletion.(Image: Facebook)Click Delete Account on the next page, enter your password, and you\u2019re done.Cutting your Insta addictionFacebook isn\u2019t just composed of Facebook and Messenger, though. Instagram and WhatsApp are also part of the company\u2019s empire.If you\u2019re trying to reduce your addiction to Instagram, you can delete your account there too.Like Facebook, Instagram lets you download your data that you\u2019ve uploaded to the site, so you\u2019ll be able to get access to all of the selfies and landscapes you\u2019ve posted to the social media site.To do that, open the Settings menu in the Instagram app and tap Security.Choose Download Data under the Data and History heading, select Request Download and enter your Instagram password. Instagram will then send all of the photos and videos you\u2019ve uploaded since you joined the service.Once you\u2019ve got your data, you\u2019re ready to cut your Instagram habit at the source.Unfortunately, Instagram doesn\u2019t let you delete your account through its app, so you\u2019ll need to visit this web page: https://www.instagram.com/accounts/remove/request/permanent/(image: Instagram)Select the reason you want to delete your account from the drop down menu, enter your password, and you\u2019re done.Deleting WhatsAppWhatsApp is far easier to delete than either Facebook or Instagram. If you\u2019re looking to get rid of the service, you simply need to tap the Settings button at the bottom of the screen in the WhatsApp app and choose Account.(Image: WhatsApp)Tap Delete My Account, enter your phone number, and press Delete My Account again. And you\u2019re finished.Image: WhatsApp)Congratulations! You\u2019re officially free of Facebook.Got a tip?
