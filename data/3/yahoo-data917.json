The voluntary layoffs will impact employees who were hired on or before September 1, 2017. While workers will initially be given the option of choosing to take a buyout package, involuntary layoffs could ensue.A driver delivers Coca-Cola products to stores in Boston, Massachusetts. (Photo: REUTERS/Brian Snyder)American Airlines (AAL)American Airlines CEO Doug Parker sent a letter to employees on August 25 warning them that about 19,000 workers would be either furloughed or laid off on October 1, if another round of federal government financial relief doesn\u2019t materialize by then.\u201cIt was assumed that by Sept. 30, the virus would be under control and demand for air travel would have returned. That is obviously not the case,\u201d Parker wrote in a letter to workers.\u201cBased on current demand levels, we at American now plan to fly less than 50% of our airline in the fourth quarter, with long-haul international particularly reduced to only 25% of 2019 levels,\u201d he added.United Airlines (UAL) United Airlines pilots are bracing for the biggest job cuts in the company\u2019s history. The airline sent a memo to employees on August 27 informing them that nearly 3,000 pilots will be furloughed between October 1 and November 30, unless Congress provides another $25 billion in financial relief, the amount the industry is currently requesting.Story continuesSalesforce (CRM)As the U.S. underwent the coronavirus shutdown in March, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff pledged to protect employees from layoffs for 90 days, in a tweet he sent on March 25.Salesforce is pledging to its workforce Ohana not to conduct any significant lay offs over the next 90 days. We will continue to pay our hourly workers while our offices are closed. We encourage our Ohana to pay their own personal hourly workers like housekeepers & dog walkers.\u2014 Marc Benioff (@Benioff) March 25, 2020Yet on August 26, Salesforce began informing employees that their jobs would be cut unless they managed to find a new position at the company within 60 days. Approximately 1,000 jobs are on the line, though the actual number of layoffs may be less if employees find another position within the enterprise software giant\u2019s ranks.In an interview with Yahoo Finance this week, Benioff expressed regret over the cuts, but added that it was \u201cpart of running our business in a successful way. And that does impact employees at different moments.\u201dBed Bath & Beyond (BBBY)Bed Bath & Beyond cut 2,800 jobs on August 26.
