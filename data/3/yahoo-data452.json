(Photo Illustration by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)Robinhood investors get a bad rep for being wild Tesla (TSLA) bulls who trade penny stocks like Hertz, hoping to make a quick buck at the publicly-traded casino.But according to a new paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research that examined the company\u2019s investors between 2018 and 2020, Robinhood investors actually haven't underperformed or been as reckless as some reports have indicated.\"The narrative of pure irrational exuberance is misleading,\" Ivo Welch, the UCLA economics professor behind the working paper, wrote.Welch\u2019s research finds that Robinhood investors are nothing new. They\u2019re part of a similar group of investors that\u2019s existed for quite some time, though not as \u201cRobinhood investors.\u201dSome of Robinhood investors' core behavioral traits were seen in retail investors in the 1990s: they bought stocks that had either gone up a lot or down a lot in the short term, probably taking note of their volatility or through investors seeking \u201csensation,\u201d Welch writes.Interestingly, Robinhood user behavior pre-2020 crisis didn\u2019t change during the coronavirus market crash in late March. Welch\u2019s research found investors \"did not panic or experience margin calls.\u201d\u201cInstead, there is evidence that as the stock market declined, investors actively added cash to fund purchases of more stocks,\u201d he wrote. This is in line with much of the anecdotal evidence as well as reports from other fund companies like Fidelity and Vanguard that reported their retail investors both stayed the course and bought the dip in March and April, seeing stocks as a long-term opportunity \u2014 so the decline in prices meant they were cheap.The Robinhood investment app is seen on a smartphone on June 24, 2020 in Washington,DC. (Photo by JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images)Welch found that retail investors on Robinhood, an investing app that offers no-commission trades, reacted immediately after large movements in the market \u2013 either the next day or three to four days later, which Welch noted was the same time it usually takes to make a bank transfer, to add money to their accounts to trade. Most of these large market movements were in April and May.Story continues\u201cThus, the evidence suggests that Robinhood investors collectively acted as a (small) market-stabilizing force,\u201d Welch writes.\u2018Plenty of opportunity to poke fun at their holdings\u2019That Robinhood investor behavior may look sensible in many ways in retrospect, buying big stocks at a discount. But at the same time, this new cohort of traders snapped up a lot of tiny stocks and made questionable decisions.\u201cThere is plenty of opportunity to poke fun at their holdings,\u201d Welch writes, pointing out that these investors preferred certain stocks like Ford (F) over GM (GM) for potentially arbitrary reasons, or kept Facebook (FB) underweight.\u201cThey fell in love with some obscure experience stocks, such as cannabis stocks, and some risky technology/gamble stocks,\u201d Welch found. \u201cAnd they displayed some of the same behavioral-finance biases documented in previous literature, especially with respect to a liking of stocks experiencing extreme stock price increases or decreases.\u201dTraders work during the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on March 5, 2020 at Wall Street in New York City. (Photo by JOHANNES EISELE/AFP via Getty Images)Of course, both of those behavioral finance \u201cbiases\u201d are enshrined in popular trading strategies like momentum trading (trading \u201chot\u201d stocks because they\u2019ll keep zooming) and buying stock that\u2019s fallen in value, expecting it to go up based on fundamentals, or in the case of Hertz, speculation.On the whole, however, the study found that Robinhood investors largely chose stocks of companies they were familiar with, not just megacaps or obscure stocks. \"By mid-2020, Robinhood investors had even pivoted towards fallen old-economy stocks,\" Welch writes.The paper found that Robinhood investors were rewarded by their grit and steadfastness in the face of the market crash in March, something that Welch sees as possibly distinct from investors with larger portfolios. For them, the assumption is they are not new to the market and do not trade with the millennial-friendly app.With more money to lose, that group takes a more conservative approach than the Robinhood crowd \u2014 though, as Welch points out, the app\u2019s users are not nearly as aggressive as often portrayed.\u201cit is easy to tell a tale that Robinhood retail investors fit the stereotype of the unsophisticated gambler, earning low returns and being taken advantage of by more sophisticated professional traders,\u201d Welch writes. \u201cHowever, [my findings] show that this narrative seems incorrect.\u201d\u2014Ethan Wolff-Mann is a writer at Yahoo Finance focusing on consumer issues, personal finance, retail, airlines, and more.
