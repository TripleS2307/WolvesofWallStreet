The app has been downloaded 165 million times in the U.S., accounting for 8.2% of its 2 billion downloads globally, according to data from Sensor Tower.But its growing success has been met with suspicion by lawmakers and corporations who say TikTok\u2019s Chinese ownership poses national security risks because the company could be compelled to share its user data with the Chinese government.Last week, Wells Fargo (WFC) ordered its employees to remove the app from company phones, citing concerns over TikTok\u2019s privacy and security controls and practices. That came after Amazon (AMZN) demanded its employees remove the app, though the company later said the email was sent by mistake.The Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee have both discouraged party members and campaigns from downloading the app, while White House trade advisor Peter Navarro recently alleged data collected on the platform \u201cgoes right to servers in China, right to the Chinese military, the Chinese Communist Party, and the agencies that want to steal our intellectual property.\u201dTikTok has repeatedly denied those allegations, saying that data of U.S. users are stored on servers in the United States, with a backup in Singapore.Story continuesFrom the perspective of teens flooding onto TikTok, the Chinese-owned online video app is a major new outlet for self-expression, one proudly home to the silly, the loud and the weird. To others, though, the service is an unnerving black box that could be sharing information with the Chinese government, facilitating espionage, or just promoting videos and songs some parents consider lewd. (AP Photo)\u201cWhen we're talking about a ban, an important question to consider is what the endgame is [for the administration], what they're actually looking to do,\u201d said Sherman. \u201cThat is not something that has been clearly articulated at this point.\u201d\u2018There is nothing these companies can do\u2019Sherman says an outright government ban requiring companies to filter traffic going across internet networks to block access to applications in the U.S., similar to China\u2019s Great Firewall, is unlikely, given protections laid out in the First Amendment against censorship.Instead, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States or CFIUS is expected to play a key role in minimizing TikTok\u2019s influence. The inter-agency committee used its expanded authority last year to launch a national security review of ByteDance\u2019s $1 billion acquisition of Musical.ly, the western version of Asia\u2019s TikTok at the time.The Chinese company has sought to address concerns about data collection and Chinese government influence in part, by hiring CEO Kevin Mayer from Disney (DIS) earlier this year. It is also reportedly looking to create a new management board and establish a global headquarters outside of China to show TikTok\u2019s operations are separate from ByteDance.But Samm Sacks, senior fellow at Yale Law School\u2019s Paul Tsai China Center, says anything short of a spinoff of TikTok is unlikely to assuage regulators\u2019 concerns if history is any indication.\u201cI have yet to see an example where that's happened, which makes me think that there is nothing that these companies can do if they are of Chinese national origin,\u201d Sacks said. \u201cI think the precedent that this sets is that the U.S. is willing to go down a path of cyber sovereignty in arguably similar ways as the Chinese government.\u201dCFIUS has moved aggressively to halt Chinese investments into U.S. companies, under the Trump administration. In 2018, the committee blocked Ant Financial\u2019s acquisition of Moneygram over data security concerns. Last year, CFIUS ordered Beijing Kunlun Tech Co to sell popular gay dating app Grindr over similar concerns.A general view of the Huawei UK headquarters on July 14, 2020 in Reading, England.

While the Trump administration has never publicly presented evidence of a so-called backdoor by Huawei that ties the company to the Chinese government, White House officials have repeatedly said the company poses a national security threat, creating a cloud of suspicion.Earlier this year, Republican Senators Josh Hawley and Rick Scott introduced a bill, banning federal employees from using TikTok on government devices. That came months after the U.S. military banned all personnel from using the app on government-issued devices. With the recent string of companies and organizations following suit, Sacks said an outright ban may not be necessary in order for the Trump administration to achieve its intended goals.\u201c[Company bans] are just as damaging because it raises the level of suspicion. It\u2019s like, well if Amazon isn't comfortable with this, you know, maybe we shouldn't be either. Maybe they know something we don't know,\u201d Sacks said. \u201cEven if there is no executive order, even if CFIUS doesn't take further action. That's really damaging.\u201d-Akiko Fujita is an anchor and reporter for Yahoo Finance.
