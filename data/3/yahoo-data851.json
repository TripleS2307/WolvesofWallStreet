But we think a Biden victory puts a lot of pressure on the stock market relative to things he has been saying,\u201d AdvisorShares CEO Noah Hamman said on Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade. Hamman doesn\u2019t disagree with one projection from a source Yahoo Finance talked with that a Biden win in November could send the stock market spiraling 25% lower.Says Hamman about that forecast, \u201cThat number doesn\u2019t surprise me. I\u2019m not shocked by that number. Some of it is a function of when they\u2019re in office \u2014 what they do versus what they say they\u2019re going to do. Right now the various Fed programs we have in place that the administration has been backing it produces liquidity for the marketplace. So if that policy is going to change a little bit, a 25% decline is not an unreasonable expectation.\u201dFormer vice president Biden did his part this week to rile up the market bulls that have raced up and down Wall Street in recent months.Unveiled on Thursday, Biden\u2019s \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d economic revival plan is in line with many traditional Democratic efforts around expanded social safety nets and infrastructure investments. The plan \u2014 which veers more left-leaning than some experts anticipated \u2014 devotes about $400 billion to expanding clean vehicle technology, steel production and other building materials. He is also eyeing $300 billion for investments in 5G and artificial intelligence.Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden walks from the podium after speaking at McGregor Industries in Dunmore, Pa., Thursday, July 9, 2020. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum)Biden supports lifting the minimum wage to $15 an hour. In all, the $700 billion plan from Biden targets the creation of five million jobs.To pay for it all, Biden intends to reverse President\u2019s Trump\u2019s signature corporate taxes to businesses. He would lift the statutory rate to 28% from 21% currently, which would hit the bottom lines of companies and likely their stock prices.Story continuesRhetoric on big business may also overhang stocks in a Biden presidency (or the lead-up to one).At an event on Thursday detailing the plan, Biden railed against shareholder capitalism and insisted Amazon would pay its fair share of taxes.\u201cI think they [investors] should be [worried of Biden],\u201d Beacon Policy Advisors senior research analyst Ben Koltun said on The First Trade. \u201cThere are a lot of themes like buy American, help the middle class and small businesses, restoring manufacturing and anti-big business. That\u2019s all boilerplate aspirations in the campaign and as the saying goes, politicians can\u2019t campaign in poetry but campaign in prose. Scranton Joe should be taken seriously. In his 36-year Senate career, his voting record was in the middle of the Democratic caucus. He\u2019s a pragmatist who is in tune with the changing dynamics of the party. And so when Biden comes out with an economic populism plan, it\u2019s something not just supported by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. It will be supported by the Joe Manchins of the world.\u201dTake Scranton Joe Biden seriously, investors. Or else.Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
