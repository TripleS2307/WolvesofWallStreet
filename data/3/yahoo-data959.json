Trump found a news story featuring one slide from a Goodyear presentation to employees in Topeka, Kan., on what is acceptable workplace attire. The slide says Black Lives Matter and LGBT messages are acceptable. Under unacceptable: Blue Lives Matter, All Lives Matter, MAGA gear, and other politically affiliated material.You can see the corporate sin, right? Goodyear doesn\u2019t want its workers wearing Trump\u2019s MAGA brand hats and shirts around the workplace. So Goodyear has earned Trump\u2019s wrath. \u201cDon\u2019t buy GOODYEAR TIRES,\u201d Trump tweeted on Aug. 19. \u201cGet better tires for far less!\u201dRising Chinese tire importsGoodyear employs at least 7,000 unionized workers in 14 U.S. plants, according to its latest annual report. The company\u2019s headquarters is in Akron, Ohio\u2014a state Trump has to win in November to have a chance of beating Joe Biden. Goodyear has facilities in the crucial swing states of Florida and North Carolina, along with Texas, which some analysts think Democrats could win. Does Trump hope his call for a boycott wrecks the company\u2019s sales and throws those workers out of a job?It could happen. The company\u2019s stock price fell nearly 4% in the aftermath of Trump\u2019s attack, indicating investors think Trump could materially harm the company. The question now is whether Trump will mount a sustained assault against Goodyear, as he has against other corporate targets, such as Amazon, the US Postal Service, Carrier, Boeing and General Motors. Or, will he let it drop? If Trump leaves it at one tweet and backs off, Goodyear will probably recover.In this Monday, Dec. 30, 2019, file photograph, the company sign hangs over vehicles waiting for repair outside a Goodyear Tire and Service store in downtown Denver.

Chinese tire imports to the United States have been rising by double-digits, with China the top importer, followed by Thailand, Canada and South Korea. Trump of course has railed against cheap Chinese products that used to be made in America, and slapped tariffs on billions of dollars\u2019 worth of Chinese imports. But that was before Goodyear banned MAGA hats.Story continuesGoodyear was obviously trying to address the intense and sometimes hostile partisanship that exists everywhere in America these days. A more savvy approach would have been to ban attire with any sort of political messaging, without singling out Trump\u2019s MAGA brand. In response to Trump\u2019s attack, Goodyear says there were some \u201cmisconceptions\u201d about the MAGA ban. But its response reads like corporate gobbledygook and leaves the company open to more bashing from Trump. (Goodyear said it asks associates \u201cto refrain from workplace expressions in support of political campaigning for any candidate or political party, as well as similar forms of advocacy that fall outside the scope of racial justice and equity issues.\u201d)TULSA, USA - JUNE 20: U.S. President Donald Trump meet his supporters at his ''Make America Great Again'' rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, United States on June 20, 2020. (Photo by Kyle Mazza/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)The Goodyear fracas is the mirror image of the dustup over Goya Foods in July. Goya\u2019s CEO, Robert Unanue, visited the White House on July 9 and throatily praised Trump, prompting some Trump critics to boycott the company. Trump promoted Goya products from inside the White House and encouraged his supporters to buy out the stores, making Goya products a weird litmus test of one\u2019s conservative or progressive bona fides.Now, tires. Goodyear is the leading tire brand in the United States, and it also owns Dunlop, Kelly and other brands. So Trump haters could buy more of those tires while Trump lovers buy fewer. The good news for Goodyear may be that most people don\u2019t buy tires every month, and Trump may have moved on to some other villain\u2014or be gone from the White House\u2014by the time most Americans have to make their next tire purchase. But don\u2019t expect to see Trump wearing a Goodyear hat.Rick Newman is the author of four books, including \u201cRebounders: How Winners Pivot from Setback to Success.\u201d Follow him on Twitter: @rickjnewman.
