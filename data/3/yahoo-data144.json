But President Trump may be raising (or lowering) the bar.In an Aug. 8 executive memorandum, Trump directed the Treasury Department to \u201cdefer\u201d collection of the payroll tax that most Americans pay, from Sept. 1 through Dec. 31. The payroll tax is a 7.65% mandatory deduction that helps fund Social Security and Medicare. So somebody making $50,000 per year would save about $1,300 during the four-month period. Trump\u2019s order applies only to incomes up to $2,000 per week, or $104,000 per year, giving it some populist flavor.There\u2019s a problem, though. Since it\u2019s a tax deferral, not tax forgiveness, workers would owe the tax back in 2021. The point of that is dubious, since people who need the money most to buy essentials now would be the least likely to come up with the payback amount next year. The obvious solution, politically, is to make the tax deferral a permanent tax cut once the money is due back.Trump says he\u2019ll do that\u2014if elected to a second term. After signing the directive on Aug. 8, Trump said he\u2019ll \u201cterminate\u201d the tax permanently if he gets reelected, so that nobody would have to repay it. Joe Biden, Trump\u2019s Democratic opponent, called Trump\u2019s payroll tax cut \u201creckless\u201d and described it as an attack on Social Security, indicating he opposes the whole idea and won\u2019t forgive the tax if he wins in November.President Donald Trump signs an executive order during a news conference at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., Saturday, Aug. 8, 2020. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)Trump, therefore, has created a framework in which he can claim a gift to workers that they only get to keep if they vote for him in November. If Biden wins, they\u2019ll have to give the money back. Trump is the giver, Biden is the taker. A vote for Trump is a vote for keeping money in your pocket. A vote for Biden is like opening your wallet to Uncle Sam.Will voters buy it? It depends which candidate wins the messaging war during the next 11 weeks. Biden\u2019s challenge seems easier. Social Security and Medicare are very popular programs, especially among the seniors they benefit. By pulling about $100 billion in funding from the two programs, Trump is touching the \u201cthird rail of politics\u201d and hoping seniors\u2014who vote in higher proportion than any other age group\u2014won\u2019t punish him. Biden is already hammering Trump for endangering seniors\u2019 livelihoods.Story continuesThere\u2019s also the irritating matter of Congress, which would have to pass legislation in order to forgive any tax owed by law. It\u2019s already questionable whether Trump can legally defer the collection of taxes, as he has proposed. It\u2019s clear he can\u2019t cancel, raise or lower taxes on his own, without legislation. There\u2019s essentially no chance Republicans will take control of the House in November, so at best a reelected Trump would have to deal with a split Congress, as he does now.Why Trump can\u2019t cancel the payroll tax nowA reasonable question for Trump is why wait till you\u2019re re-elected to cancel this tax? Why not just do it now? The answer is that Congress won\u2019t go along with it\u2014not now, and not in 2021. Defending Social Security and Medicare is an existential mission of the Democratic party, and there aren\u2019t a lot of Republicans willing to defund the programs, either.Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden puts on his mask as he leaves a campaign event at the William \"Hicks\" Anderson Community Center in Wilmington, Del., Tuesday, July 28, 2020.(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)Trump does seem to have won a few brownie points, however, for doing something as Congress dithers over further stimulus measures. If Congress comes through with a large new package, which is likely, Trump\u2019s payroll tax deferral will probably be forgotten. But if not, Trump can claim he did the most he was able to do, absent legislation.Biden is also on record as planning to raise taxes, so Trump won\u2018t have to stretch that much to label him the tax grinch. The difference is that Biden wants to raise taxes only on those earning at least $400,000 per year. By undoing Trump\u2019s payroll tax deferral, Biden would be \u201craising\u201d taxes on low-income workers, violating his own ethos of standing up for the little guy.All of this suggests that if Trump\u2019s tax deferral really goes into effect, and Biden wins, he may have no choice but to seek legislation in 2021 forgiving those deferred taxes. At the same time, Democrats would probably try to compensate for the $100 billion in lost funding by raising taxes even more on the wealthy. It could end up being a parting gift from Trump to workers, whether he intends it or not.Rick Newman is the author of four books, including \u201cRebounders: How Winners Pivot from Setback to Success.\u201d Follow him on Twitter: @rickjnewman.
