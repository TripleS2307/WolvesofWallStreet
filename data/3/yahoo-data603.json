According to a recent Yahoo Finance-Harris poll, 44% of investors try to time the market and people who are trading frequently are making around four trades per month on average, which really does add up and can create hefty taxable gains (for the lucky ones).Many people might not be aware that they\u2019ll be on the hook for a big chunk of money come tax time \u2014 or earlier, if they have to pay estimated taxes. (Getty Images)Barry Ritholtz, chairman and CIO of Ritholtz Wealth Management and a consistent voice of reason in the financial media, wrote a piece recently about \u201cmarket timing and profit\u201d that gets to the heart of a potential problem for investors who shuffle their stocks frequently: the fact that every trade made has a \u201csilent partner,\u201d Uncle Sam.Whether you should time the market is debatable. Ritholtz and most experts advise against it, but a lot of people, especially rich ones, do it frequently.But the main problem, Ritholtz writes, is that doing so often means you hold a security less than a year, which means you have to pay taxes as if the gains were ordinary income and not long-term capital gains, which enjoy lower tax rates. (Short-term capital gains come from selling assets for a year or less, and are taxed at your ordinary income tax rate. Long-term capital gains are gains on investments you owned for more than one year. They're subject to a 0%, 15%, or 20% tax rate, depending on your level of taxable income.)The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) headquarters building in Washington. (AP Photo/J. David Ake, File)Uncle Sam is involved with all your trading wins, Ritholtz says, and he\u2019s definitely more than a \u201cjunior silent partner.\u201d States also usually have their own taxes as well, making short-term trading even less profitable.Story continuesA key problem for the new batch of day traders, powered by trades that cost $0, is that a lot of people might not be aware that they\u2019ll be on the hook for a big chunk of money come tax time \u2014 or earlier, if they have to pay estimated taxes.\u201cThey may not realize they have a partner,\u201d Ritholtz told Yahoo Finance.Taxes and gains are two very interrelated things, but they can seem independent to someone making frequent trades months before there\u2019s any hint of \u201ctax season\u201d in the air.Brokers like Robinhood, Fidelity, Vanguard, Schwab and others have resources on their websites for investors to learn about cost basis, capital gains, tax brackets, and other related topics, but anyone who realizes gains has to be proactive to learn about their tax responsibilities that might change how an investment strategy works.---Ethan Wolff-Mann is a writer at Yahoo Finance focusing on consumer issues, personal finance, retail, airlines, and more.
