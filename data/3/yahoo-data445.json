Still, the three major indices extended the past few weeks\u2019 worth of declines, as concerns over stagnating coronavirus case improvement stoked fears of more lockdowns, and as political uncertainty nudged investors away from risk assets.[Click here to read what\u2019s moving markets heading into Tuesday, September 22]The Dow fell more than 500 points, or 1.8%, adding to a cumulative more than 350-point slide in the index from Thursday to Friday last week. The Dow was off by as many as 942 points, or 3.4%, at its worst point during the session.The S&P 500 dropped 1.2% and at session lows was down about 9.8% from its recent closing high from Sept. 2 to come within striking distance of falling into a correction, or a drop of at least 10% from a recent high. The index logged a four-session losing streak, or its longest since February.\u201cSo far, the market has over-shot our expectations for a 4% to 6% haircut from recent highs on near-term extended valuations, as well as economic and Covid-19 risks. That said, the declines through last Friday are not all that surprising,\u201d John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist for Oppenheimer Asset Management, said in a note Monday. \u201cIt is that September \u2014 traditionally but not always \u2014 can be tough month for stocks. The S&P 500 had delivered a massive rally rising 60% from the lows on March 23 through September 2. Markets tend to overshoot to the upside as well as to the downside.\u201dOther analysts pointed to developments \u2013 and in some cases, a lack of progress \u2013 in Washington, D.C. as contributors to the pullback.\u201cThe root causes of the recent drawdown in US large caps are [first], recent weakness in real-time economic indicators, [second] the lack of movement on a fiscal stimulus package that could offset #1 and [third] the Fed\u2019s lackluster forecasts in its Wednesday release of the Summary of Economic Projections,\u201d Nicholas Colas, Co-founder of DataTrek Research, wrote in a note Monday morning.Story continuesShares of major bank stocks including JPMorgan Chase (JPM), HSBC (HSBC) and Deutsche Bank (DB) slid following a report that they and other financial institutions for decades facilitated fund transactions used for allegedly criminal activities, and failed to report suspicious activity.Meanwhile, heavily weighted big tech stocks Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) reversed earlier losses to trade slightly higher.

Covid-related deaths in the US neared 200,000, and new cases have risen significantly in Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nebraska and North Dakota over the past week. Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb told CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday that he thinks \u201cwe have at least one more cycle with this virus heading into the fall and winter.\u201d In Europe, countries including France and Germany have been grappling with marches higher in daily cases, and the World Health Organization warned last week of a \u201cvery serious situation unfolding\u201d in Europe over the virus.Cruise stock Royal Caribbean Group (RCL) fell more than 7%, and airlines including United Airlines (UAL), Southwest (LUV) and Delta (DAL) also came under pressure.\u20144:03 p.m. ET: Stocks fall, S&P 500 posts longest losing streak since FebruaryHere were the main moves in markets as of 4:03 p.m. ET:S&P 500 (^GSPC): -38.42 (-1.16%) to 3,281.05Dow (^DJI): -510.18 (-1.84%) to 27,147.24Nasdaq (^IXIC): -14.48 (-0.13%) to 10,778.80Crude (CL=F): -$1.61 (-3.92%) to $39.50 a barrelGold (GC=F): -$46.40 (-2.36%) to $1,915.70 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): -2.3 bps to yield 0.6710%\u20143:13 p.m. ET: Stocks hold lower but come off session lowsThe three major indices remained sharply lower, but came off their worst points of the session Monday afternoon, with less than an hour remaining in the trading day.
