The bank\u2019s economists argue the policy has the added benefit of reducing new coronavirus infections \u2014 and the likelihood of renewed lockdowns that would decimate economic growth even more.However, \u201cthere are also other ways to reduce infections, including stringent bans on large gatherings and greater use of face masks,\u201d Goldman wrote in research published late Monday.In doing so, the bank argued in favor of a nationwide mask mandate, a move embraced recently by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi yet fulsomely rejected by civil libertarians. Face coverings have grown more polarizing in the face of surging coronavirus infections, particularly in new epicenters in Sun Belt states.Wall Street has been buffeted by fears that a new wave of COVID-19 infections could derail the relaxation of stay-at-home orders throttling growth. Investors have largely discounted rising infections, but fear a return to the restrictive lockdowns that brought public life to a screeching halt in March.Still, Goldman wrote that \u201ca national face mask mandate could partially substitute for renewed lockdowns,\u201d with its data suggesting that a federal standard \u201cwould likely increase face mask usage meaningfully, especially in states such as Florida and Texas where masks remain largely voluntary to date.\u201d\u2018Significantly better outcomes\u2019A groundswell of localized opposition belies the fact that most Americans have adopted using masks, despite aesthetic concerns and ideological dispositions. A Pew Research poll last week found that at least 65% of Americans have adopted the near constant use of personal protective equipment (PPE), in line with Goldman\u2019s own data.\u201cWe find that face masks are associated with significantly better coronavirus outcomes,\u201d the bank\u2019s economists wrote, with those findings bolstered by data suggesting \u201ca largely causal impact of masks rather than correlation with other factors (such as reduced mobility or avoidance of large gatherings).\u201dStory continuesThe argument is being shaped by the historical relationship between the federal government and states being allowed to go their own way on some issues.While the U.S. has a national recommendation for public masking in place, it falls short of an enforceable requirement. Vice President Mike Pence has resisted the call for a national mandate, while President Donald Trump refuses to wear a mask in public at all.However Goldman\u2019s baseline assumptions suggest \u201ca national mandate could raise the percentage of people who wear masks by 15 percentage points, and cut the daily growth rate of confirmed cases by 1.0 to 0.6%.\u201dBy extension, a mask mandate could function as a stand-in for new lockdowns that would shave nearly 5% from gross domestic product (GDP), the bank added.Medical workers treat a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patient at the United Memorial Medical Center's coronavirus disease (COVID-19) intensive care unit in Houston, Texas, U.S., June 29, 2020. REUTERS/Callaghan O'HareThe mask debate has profound public health implications, as well as import for an economy still reeling from the COVID-19-related lockdowns. The debate has converged with a general fatigue among citizens weary of quarantines and widespread social unrest challenging official efforts to prevent further spreading.Dr. Hilary Fairbrother, a Houston emergency medicine physician at the McGovern Medical School, told Yahoo Finance last week that social distancing in the hard-hit Lone Star State \u201cdidn\u2019t stick\u201d because the initial wave of coronavirus cases was relatively tame.Once quarantine fatigue set in, \u201cpeople started gathering, weren\u2019t wearing masks anymore and went to see family and local vehicular travel,\u201d all of which contributed to the current surge, Fairbrother added.And a desultory and mostly voluntary masking policy has worsened the problem in places like Arizona and Texas, doctors in those regions contend. Goldman\u2019s data found that face mask mandates have \u201clarge and highly statistically significant effects\u201d on public health.\u201cOur estimates imply that mask mandates lower the infection growth rate by 1.3 percentage points in the 11-15 days after announcement\u201d and curb the rate of infections by 25%, the bank noted.\u201cWe also estimate significant and somewhat larger declines in the growth rate of COVID-19 fatalities of 2.4 percentage points in the 11-15 days after announcement and of 3.7 percentage points in the 21-29 days after,\u201d it added.Although the prospect of another nationwide lockdown is seen as a low probability event, it\u2019s not entirely impossible as new case surges in key parts of the country force local officials to roll back their reopening plans.\u201cAt this point, there seems to be little appetite for widespread stay-at-home orders or business closures such as those implemented in most states in late March and April,\u201d Wells Fargo wrote in an analysis last week.\u201cStill, the intensification of the virus could, by itself, harm economic activity, even in the absence of new lockdown orders,\u201d the bank\u2019s analysts said.\u201cEven without official government intervention, there is also the risk that a renewed outbreak could curb spending if households pull back from the economy or businesses close out of fear of the virus,\u201d Wells added."}]}
