New home sales are counted at the signing of a contract, making them a leading housing market indicator. June's sales pace was revised upward to 791,000 units from the previously reported 776,000 units.Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 14% of housing market sales, gaining 1.3% to a rate of 785,000-units.
