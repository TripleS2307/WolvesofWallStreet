There was forbearance, but not the large scale that we put into place with the help of the Fannie, Freddie, Ginnie Mae [GNMA],\" Shinoda added.Woman Handing Over the House Keys To A New Home Inside Empty Room.The millennial effectThroughout COVID-19 and its economic crisis, the housing market has not only been resilient, but it's remained one of the areas of strength. On Friday, data showed that existing home sales skyrocketed by a record 24.7%, helped by rock-bottom interest rates.According to Shinoda, among the factors driving the housing market are the favorable supply/demand technicals, with a low inventory of homes already available for sale supported by demographics. Millennials, the second largest generation behind the baby boomers, are starting to buy homes as they get deeper into their 30s.Story continuesThe age cohor has \u201c been saving up some money. They're starting to have kids. They're going to want to be in a house,\u201d Shinoda explained.\u201cBeing in a one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan doesn't sound so good when you've got two little kids. So, that migration had already started,\" he added.Another reason housing fundamentals have remained sound is the improved affordability.\"Affordability is driven by two things really \u2014 it's income, which had been rising, and then interest rates, which drive mortgage rates. Those are at historic lows. So, going into COVID, things have looked pretty good,\" he stated.To be sure, concerns were surrounding the spike in unemployment during the pandemic and its impact on the housing market, especially among hourly wage workers. However the portfolio manager said that white collar employees with higher paying jobs are haven\u2019t been hit as hard \u201cthus far.\u201dWhile the bulk of these job losses hit lower-income households the hardest, DoubleLine Capital's CEO Jeffrey Gundlach recently made a case that \"another wave\" of layoffs loom for white-collar workers. Back in July, he told Yahoo Finance that people in the $100,000 to $150,000 bracket \"might be at risk also in another wave of layoffs because those people don't really have any savings by and large.\"Shinoda agreed that professional job losses could come if there's continued economic malaise, but the forbearance could resolve those hardships on repaying mortgages.Julia La Roche is a Correspondent for Yahoo Finance.
