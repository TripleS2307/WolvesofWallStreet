Kaplan preferred to recycle the old language committing the Fed to near-zero rates \u201cuntil the Committee is confident the economy has weathered recent events.\u201dMinneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari also dissented, but made the case for an even stronger commitment of keeping rates at near-zero until inflation has reached 2% \u201con a sustained basis.\u201dChairman Powell on Wednesday said the two voting members of the FOMC appeared to be on \u201ctwo sides of the discussion\u201d but welcomed the \u201cdifferent perspectives.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no cookbook and this is the first guidance under our new framework so of course there would be a wide range of views,\u201d Powell said.Fed watchers were mixed on the efficacy of Powell\u2019s message with the new forward guidance. Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, said Wednesday that the markets were hoping for \u201cexplicit guidance\u201d on the Fed\u2019s new strategy to allow inflation to \u201cmoderately\u201d overshoot its 2% target.\u201cThe Fed Chair chose not to share details,\u201d said Shah. \u201cHe also failed to discuss how they will utilise the toolkit, leaving investors in the dark about how it will push inflation to 2%, let alone overshoot it.\u201dStory continuesMinneapolis Federal Reserve president Neel Kashkari participates in the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit at Union West on Thursday, Oct. 10, 2019, in New York. (Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP)Powell acknowledged in the press conference that describing the mechanics of overshooting inflation are \u201cchallenging,\u201d but emphasized that higher inflation expectations are key to giving the Fed more policy space on rates.\u201cIf inflation averages 2%, the public will expect that and that\u2019ll be what\u2019s built into interest rates. That\u2019s all we want,\u201d Powell said in response to a question from Yahoo Finance.\u2018It will take a while\u2019Krishna Guha and Ernie Tedeschi at Evercore ISI wrote Wednesday that the forward guidance announced today is \u201cbullish-dovish\u201d given their expectations that guidance was not going to come until November or December. But an interesting wild card for future Fed policy could be its use of quantitative easing within the forward guidance.In its statement, the Fed now describes the expansion of its asset holdings as an effort to \u201chelp foster accommodative financial conditions,\u201d a change from its previous insistence that the purchases were only for market functioning.In other words, the Fed could be keeping its powder dry for further enhancing its forward guidance.\u201cOnce again, Powell left the door open to further potential action, which would most likely involving additional QE,\u201d wrote ING\u2019s economics team Wednesday.Powell said the Fed would continue to purchase at least $80 billion a month in U.S. Treasuries and $40 billion a month in mortgage-backed securities. He reiterated the Fed could adjust its monetary policy stance if \u201crisks emerge that could impede\u201d its objectives as laid out in the guidance.\u201cI certainly would not say that we\u2019re out of ammo, not at all,\u201d Powell said.The Fed has telegraphed that at least for the next few years, the central bank will not raise rates. The median member of the FOMC projected interest rates remaining in the target range of between 0% and 0.25% through the end of 2023.The Fed\u2019s next policy-setting meeting will take place November 4 and 5.Brian Cheung is a reporter covering the Fed, economics, and banking for Yahoo Finance.
