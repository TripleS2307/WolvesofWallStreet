It\u2019s similar to the expansion of Kylie Cosmetics, which was founded by Kardashian\u2019s younger sister Kylie Jenner back in 2014.Coty purchased a majority stake in Jenner\u2019s business for $600 million back in November of 2019, which catapulted the company to an impressive $1.2 billion valuation \u2014 a figure that\u2019s since been hotly disputed.Coty has invested in both Kim Kardashian's KKW Beauty and Kylie Jenner's Kylie CosmeticsStill, the sky-high valuations of both companies represent a larger trend in the beauty space as interest in social media-driven, celebrity-backed brands continues to balloon.Overall, traditional beauty houses have had to innovate in order to keep up in a world motivated by \u2018likes\u2019 and followers \u2014 and Coty\u2019s KKW purchase is yet another opportunity to appeal to a younger demographic.In recent years, the company has been highly criticized by Wall Street for overvaluing its acquisitions and failing to keep up with contemporary makeup trends.Even before the coronavirus hit, Coty was in a challenged position with falling operating cash flow, and has since felt the impact of the pandemic.So far this year, the stock is down roughly 60% \u2014 reflecting a steep drop in the sales of luxury goods and fragrances amid coronavirus lockdowns. The new virus cases surge in certain southern states is also clouding the outlook.As if that weren\u2019t enough to digest, the manufacturer behind Kardashian\u2019s and Jenner\u2019s products, Seed Beauty, is now suing Coty and Kylie Cosmetics for the alleged sharing of trade secrets, according to multiple reports.The manufacturer behind Kardashian\u2019s and Jenner\u2019s products is reportedly suing Coty and Kylie Cosmetics for the alleged sharing of trade secretsStill, Coty has been aggressive in advancing its turnaround plan.Story continuesBesides its recent acquisitions of both KKW Beauty and Kylie Cosmetics, the company announced that former L'Or\u00e9al executive and founder of skincare start-up Oreveda Sue Nabi will be taking over as CEO, starting in September 2020. This will be Coty\u2019s fifth CEO in four years.Is Kim Kardashian a billionaire?With Coty\u2019s recent purchase valuing KKW Beauty at $1 billion, many outlets immediately began to refer to Kardashian-West as an official billionaire \u2014 with husband Kanye West praising the milestone on Twitter:I am so proud of my beautiful wife Kim Kardashian West for officially becoming a billionaire You\u2019ve weathered the craziest storms and now God is shining on you and our family So blessed this is still life So I made you this still lifeWe love you so much pic.twitter.com/Vvtgzodnah\u2014 ye (@kanyewest) June 30, 2020But according to estimates by Forbes, Kardashian is most likely not a billionaire just yet.After Coty\u2019s 20% acquisition, Kardashian\u2019s KKW Beauty ownership is estimated to be at 72%, with her mother Kris Jenner owning 8% of the business.That \u2014 coupled with the fact that many believe her company was overvalued due to her large social media presence \u2014 sets Kardashian\u2019s net worth at just around $900 million. That\u2019s a rich sum to be sure, but not quite a billionaire.It\u2019s also a very similar net worth to sister Kylie Jenner, whose billionaire status was recently revoked amid claims that she overinflated the size of Kylie Cosmetics.Still, Kardashian has quite a few other revenue streams that could help her reach the billionaires club very soon.Most recently, the reality star signed an exclusive podcast deal with Spotify (SPOT) for an undisclosed amount. She also owns a popular shape-wear line, along with the mobile game \u201cKim Kardashian Hollywood.Alexandra is a Producer & Entertainment Correspondent at Yahoo Finance.
