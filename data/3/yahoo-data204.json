The president\u2019s illness highlights the urgent search for a vaccine, which could arrive before year\u2019s end.As of Friday, Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel and GOP Senator Mike Lee also tested positive, but Democratic nominee Joe Biden \u2014 who appeared on the same stage with Trump during Tuesday\u2019s ferocious debate \u2014 has tested negative, as have Vice President Mike Pence, his wife, and first daughter Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, her husband.But experts warn many of these negative tests will need to be redone in the coming days, as it remains unclear how long Trump has had the virus and therefore how early on in the incubation period some of the close contacts are in.The latest reports from the White House are that Trump\u2019s symptoms are mild, but as an elderly and overweight male, the president is considered part of a high risk category for the disease to develop into more severe case.\u201cThis virus has an unpredictable course,\u201d Yahoo medical contributor Dr. Dara Kass told Yahoo Finance on Friday.Zeke Emanuel, a former National Institute of Health official and current vice provost of global initiatives at the University of Pennsylvania, noted that someone in the President\u2019s age and weight group is like 5% to 12% more likely to die from the virus, but without any additional transparency from the White House, it would be hard to assess the severity.Story continuesStirring even more concern late Friday, the White House reported Trump was being taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for additional tests, after being given a dose of Regeneron\u2019s (REGN) trial antibody therapy, which some health experts said could be risky as the therapy was still in late-stage trials\u2014 even though the company announced positive results this week. Trump received the dose through a compassionate use request, according to Regeneron.\u201cTaking an experimental treatment and leaving for Walter Reed on day 1 of his diagnosis is not something you would do just to have access to care,\u201d said Dr. Howard Forman, Yale University professor and health policy expert.Late Friday night, the White House physician reported Trump was being treated with Gilead Science\u2019s (GILD) remdesivir, the only authorized treatment to-date.Health experts noted that if the President was switched to dexamethasone, another promising but generic treatment option, that would be a sign of concern. Trump was also taking zinc, aspirin, and other general medication, per an earlier physician\u2019s report.\u2018No one is safe\u2019There are over 7 million cases in the U.S. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)Now that several individuals have tested positive, Kass said all of the venues at which Trump has appeared this week have the potential to become \u201csuperspreader\u201d events.According to reports, White House staff knew Hicks was confirmed positive before attending a rally in Minnesota on Wednesday but attempted to keep it under wraps as Trump traveled the next day to New Jersey for a campaign event. Trump appeared lethargic at the New Jersey event, according to reports, and once again downplayed the virus while he was at the rally.Kass pointed to the this week\u2019s debate, where Trump\u2019s team did not follow masking rules required by the venue. \u201cIf they were within 6 feet of the President, unmasked, for over 15 minutes, they are at risk and need to be quarantined for 14 days, regardless of negative tests,\u201d the doctor said.\u201cThat could extend as far as the cabinet\u201d and other officials close to Trump, Kass added. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know how many people were in contact with the President or any other positive patients at this point,\u201d she said.The Bidens released a message wishing the Trumps a \u201cswift recovery,\u201d while his running mate, Kamala Harris, tested negative.Jill and I send our thoughts to President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump for a swift recovery. We will continue to pray for the health and safety of the president and his family.\u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) October 2, 2020The White House reported Friday that Judge Amy Coney Barrett, the Supreme Court nominee, has tested negative for the virus \u2014 but she already had the virus this summer, so it is likely her antibodies are still in effect.But even with the number of close contacts reporting negative tests, health experts warn it is still too early to tell if those negative results will remain so within the next 14 days. Another focus is the event announcing Barrett\u2019s nomination, attended by Notre Dame President Rev. John Jenkins who reported positive for the virus Friday, adding to the list of concerning events.Emanuel told Yahoo Finance the debate stage and venue in Cleveland could have resulted in dangerous exposure for the two candidates \u2014 being stuck in an enclosed space for more than 90 minutes with the amount of high-volume exchanges that meant more air droplets filling the air.\u201cWhere was the plexiglass?\u201d Emanuel said, noting that any upcoming debates should consider such a change.Still, the president\u2019s shock revelation will require aggressive contact tracing in the coming days, as well as assessing Trump\u2019s health developments.Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and professor at the George Washington University school of public health, told Yahoo Finance the road ahead is likely to be long and arduous.While the President is currently displaying mild symptoms, it is too early to tell how badly the virus will affect him. Wen noted that of the more than 7.2 million individuals in the U.S. that have tested positive, 40% have mild symptoms.It will be at least 5 to 7 days before he shows any real symptoms, and at least 10 to 12 days from symptom onset before it could \u2014 in theory \u2014 get more serious. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the world\u2019s first major leader who tested positive this spring, had an initially mild case before winding up in intensive care within days of his diagnosis.\u201cWe should not breathe a sigh of relief if in the next couple of days he seems fine,\u201d Wen told Yahoo Finance.\u201cIt\u2019s important for people to know this is an extremely contagious virus, which easily spreads from person to person. No one is safe from it, not even the President of the United States.\u201dIn light of the shocking news, and ongoing monitoring of individuals who may be infected, the White House has now ordered masks to be worn any time staffers are outside their offices in the building. The mandate is a significant shift from Trump\u2019s previous stance, avoiding mask wearing, which stood in stark contrast to his top health officials who have repeatedly pushed for mask-wearing.More from Anjalee:Redfield: CDC 'preparing earnestly' for vaccine in November, DecemberIndia's tech giants navigate 'literally spiking' WFH demand, H1-B fears in coronavirus eraHow protests spurred Corporate America into action on race, inequalityRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube."}]}
