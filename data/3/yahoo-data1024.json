There\u2019s a lot of other issues involved if we\u2019re serious about tackling these issues.\u201dIn St. Louis, the police department has an operating budget of $134.5 million for the year 2020. This year, Missouri Gov. Mike Parson announced budget cuts as the state faces revenue shortfalls thanks to the coronavirus pandemic. The more than $200 million in budget restrictions hit the state\u2019s schools, but left the policing budget untouched.\u201cI do think there\u2019s a discussion beyond just reforms as it relates to policing we ought to be having,\u201d Schmitt said.Schmitt highlighted education and \u201cincreased\u201d choice as the first place to start, but applauded the president\u2019s executive order, calling it a \u201creally important step moving forward,\u201d and stated it was part of \u201congoing dialogue.\u201dAnd while additional training and moves from Congress are needed moving forward, the AG says he doesn\u2019t support any initiatives around defunding the police.It \u201cwould really inhibit the ability to do a lot of the things being talked about,\u201d Schmitt said. \u201cAdditional money for training, bodycams, dashcams, those sorts of things.\u201d\u201cAt a time where we\u2019re rising crime rates in a lot of our cities, removing that funding, critical funding for police departments to do that dangerous work, would be a huge mistake.\u201dParticipants raise their fists in solidarity during a moment of silence for those lost to police brutality, under the Gateway Arch during a rally in St. Louis on Sunday, June 14, 2020. (Robert Cohen/St. Louis Post-Dispatch via AP)The Attorney General has supported other reforms in the state in the past, particularly in the St. Louis area. After discovering that St. Louis received its biggest source of revenue from writing traffic tickets, the AG sued the city to end the practice.In talking with Yahoo Finance, the AG said police applauded the move as it enabled them to do more \u201ccommunity policing.\u201dStory continuesHe also supported ending residency requirements for police officers, a move that many activists say could limit efforts for community policing.\u201cThere were significant reforms in the wake of Ferguson here in Missouri,\u201d Schmitt said, referring to the 2014 shooting of Mike Brown and the ensuing protests, \u201cthat I think other local communities might adopt. This is a big, broad national discussion.\u201d\u201cBut I think community policing, body, dashcams, training, de-escalation \u2014 these are important things by the way that are not accomplished if you defund police departments.\u201dSchmitt added that the issue is how to \u201cdeal with police officers that should no longer wear the uniform,\u201d pointing to the murder of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police.\u201cMy assumption is that will be something we deal with moving forward,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an important conversation for us to have.\u201d\u201cQuite frankly, we\u2019ve been having that conversation over the last five years post-Ferguson here in Missouri, and the rest of the country I think is starting to have that conversation too.Kristin Myers is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
