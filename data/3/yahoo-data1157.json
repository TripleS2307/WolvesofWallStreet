But the healing will be anything but immediate, at least for airlines, says the chair and CEO of Southwest (LUV).The airline understands the public\u2019s concerns with the dangers from the close confines of air travel. Southwest is keeping middle seats open, enforcing safety measures like mask-wearing, and is stepping up its refund policy, and has pushed for thermal testing by the TSA. (Other airlines are taking similar measures.)But even that may not get it done.\"At a point, you just can't make people fly,\u201d Gary Kelly, Southwest\u2019s CEO, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cYou can't send out a memo and say, 'thou shalt travel from A to B\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cIn economic recessions, it's classic that business travel will be cut very sharply.\u201dWhile consumers will still travel, Kelly added, it\u2019ll be at reduced fares.A Southwest Airlines airplane comes in for a landing at Los Angeles International Airport on May 12, 2020 in Los Angeles, California.
