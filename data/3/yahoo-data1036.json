Driven by his passion to make Asian food accessible to the average American diner, not just the gourmands, Chang has built an impressive and unconventional empire through the Momofuku restaurant group.In his new book entitled, \u201cEat a Peach: A Memoir,\u201d Chang \u2014 in his signature self-deprecating manner \u2014 delves deep into his disillusionment with the high-brow culinary ecosystem, battles with mental health and bipolar disorder and toxic work environments that he was subject to but also helped perpetuate.\u201cThe industry, particularly a certain kind of dining, is based on a military system. And a lot of that toxic behavior is...I came from that, right, and I've been a bully, and I've verbally abused people. And it's something that I've worked really hard on,\u201d Chang told Yahoo Finance editor-in-chief Andy Serwer earlier this month, in response to a question about sexism in the restaurant industry. \u201cIt\u2019s not the entire culture, but it's certainly been the part that has been celebrated.\u201dDavid Chang photographed at his restaurant Ko in New York, New York on August 26, 2019. (Photo by Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post via Getty Images)The #MeToo movement rattled the culinary world in the last two and a half years, bringing to light sexual misconduct allegations against celebrity chef Mario Batali and restaurateur Ken Friedman, among others. But the male-dominated, cutthroat pressure cooker that is the culinary world is finally starting to evolve away from being just a \u201cboy\u2019s club,\u201d Chang indicated in his interview with Yahoo Finance.\u201cI think the entire industry is trying to ask themselves the hard questions of why. I've certainly been part of the boys\u2019 club... I think we're at a point about equality, representation and opportunity. And I think treating people the way you would want to be treated,\u201d he said.\u201cAnd it's long overdue that people are saying \u2018this doesn't work anymore.\u2019 In fact, it's never really worked. And I don't know exactly what's going to happen. But I think it's in a good place where people are asking, \u2018Let's not continue this. Let's try to come up with a new solution, a new way of doing it,\u2019\u201d he added.Story continuesLast April, Chang stepped down as CEO of the Momofuku restaurant group he carefully crafted over the last decade and a half. He named 31-year-old Marguerite Zabar Mariscal, who started as an intern in 2011, his successor. She now oversees the operations of 15 restaurants and counting.Chang has been focusing on television shows like Netflix\u2019s (NFLX) \u201cUgly Delicious\u201d and \u201cBreakfast, Lunch & Dinner.\u201d Through his production company Majordomo Media, he is working on a slate of content, including a forthcoming Hulu (DIS) docuseries \u201cThe Next Thing You Eat,\u201d in collaboration with documentary filmmaker Morgan Neville.Melody Hahm is Yahoo Finance\u2019s West Coast correspondent, covering entrepreneurship, technology and culture.
