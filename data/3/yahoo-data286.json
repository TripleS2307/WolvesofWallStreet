The S&P 500 fluctuated between gains and losses but closed higher, after falling for a fourth straight session on Monday for its longest losing streak since February.[Click here to read what\u2019s moving markets heading into Wednesday, September 23] The Nasdaq outperformed, rising more than 1.7% as Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB) increased. Tesla (TSLA) shares dropped 5.6%, giving back some steep recent gains ahead of its highly anticipated inaugural Battery Day event.A blend of uncertainty around the election, a worsening coronavirus situation in Europe and parts of the US, scrutiny over big banks and concerns that further economic stimulus may not come to near-term fruition have combined to weigh heavily on equity investors, sending the S&P 500 now more than 8% below its Sept. 2 closing high. And while many tech stocks shook off earlier losses to close higher on Monday and rose on Tuesday, the group as a whole has been under press the past few weeks following a run-up earlier this summer.\u201cComing into September, the options market among other things and the figures on public participation showed that there was a lot of froth, particularly in the high-flying Nasdaq-type stocks. And from our point of view, the weakness in September is pretty reliable from a seasonal perspective,\u201d Julian Emanuel, BTIG managing director and chief equity derivatives strategist, told Yahoo Finance.In terms of whether equities may slide further, \u201cWe think you have further to go,\u201d Emanuel added. \u201cWe\u2019re keying off the 200-day moving average to the S&P 500, currently at about 3,100 versus 3,250 or so where we are, so certainly more there, and likely a bit more than that in the Nasdaq, which really had gotten ahead of itself.\u201d\u201cWe have been in an environment where the Vix (^VIX) has hovered in and around 30 essentially since March,\u201d he said, referring to the volatility-tracking index that spiked to as high 82 in March before easing. \u201cAnd when you back that out, that\u2019s part of why the markets advanced as much as they did. But when you\u2019re thinking about how much the market should correct, you know, a normal sort of 5% to 10% correction in the S&P 500 was appropriate in a Vix environment of, call it 15 to 20. We\u2019re in a higher volatility environment \u2013 probably means probably pullback in our view.\u201dStory continuesInvestors also continued to eye updates on fiscal stimulus, though prospects of another package passing through Congress before the November elections have dimmed. Congressional lawmakers directed questions around the pace of the economic recovery, and sought commentary around monetary and fiscal stimulus developments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Tuesday during a hearing before the House Financial Services Committee.\u20144:05 p.m. ET: Tech shares rebound, sending S&P 500 1.1% higher to end 4-session losing streakHere were the main moves in markets as of 4:05 p.m. ET:S&P 500 (^GSPC): +34.51 (+1.05%) to 3,315.57Dow (^DJI): +140.48 (+0.52%) to 27,288.18Nasdaq (^IXIC): +184.84 (+1.71%) to 10,963.64Crude (CL=F): +$0.24 (+0.61%) to $39.55 a barrelGold (GC=F): -$3.90 (-0.20%) to $1,906.70 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): -0.7 bps to yield 0.6640%\u20142:08 p.m. ET: Stocks push higher, shaking off earlier lossesThe three major indices pushed into positive territory Tuesday afternoon, with the Nasdaq leading the way higher with a gain of more than 1.3%.
