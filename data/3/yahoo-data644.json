The actual number of people collecting unemployment continues to steadily decline, as shown by the move down in continuing claims,\u201d Wells Fargo said in a note July 2.Closely watched continuing claims, which lag initial jobless claims data by one week, totaled 18.06 million in the week ending June 27 from 18.76 million in the prior week. Consensus expectations were for 18.75 million for the week.\u201cWeekly initial jobless claims have come in a little lower than expected at 1.314mn for week of July 4th, but remain more than double the level seen during the Global Financial Crisis,\u201d ING economist James Knightly wrote in a note Thursday. \u201cHowever, the total number of people claiming benefits under ALL programs rose to 32.9mn - up 1.4mn on the week. That is because a broader range of people qualify for benefits under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program which had 14.4mn claimants as of week June 20. This only serves to illustrate the ongoing extreme stress in the jobs market and suggests unemployment is closer to 20% than the 11.1% currently listed as the \u2018official\u2019 rate.\u201dPandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program claims, which include those who were previously ineligible for unemployment insurance such as self-employed and contracted workers, was also closely monitored in Thursday\u2019s report.Story continuesPUA claims totaled 1,038,905 on an unadjusted basis in the week ending July 4, up from the prior week\u2019s 996,842.As of Thursday morning, there were 12 million COVID-19 cases and 550,000 deaths worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins data.
