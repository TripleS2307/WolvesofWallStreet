Moreover, it could further solidify Tesla\u2019s lead in the EV space globally and help it better rival gas-powered engines.\u201cWe\u2019re all waiting to see what Tesla is going to come out with in the battery,\u201d Gu told Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade as he awaited the initial trade of his company\u2019s stock, which debuted on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. Xpeng doesn\u2019t manufacturer its own batteries.Gu adds, \u201cSo for us, obviously we love to work with the best-in-class technology by the manufacturers. If there is a technology that provides safer, cost efficient and better cells, we would love to work with them. I think we would look forward to seeing the rapid development which will drive the growth of the overall industry.\u201dGUANGZHOU, CHINA - NOVEMBER 22: A Xpeng G3 car is on display during the 17th Guangzhou International Automobile Exhibition at China Import and Export Fair Complex on November 22, 2019 in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province of China.

The anticipation is a small part of the reason Tesla\u2019s stock has exploded 190% inside of six months.\u201cIn our opinion this battery technology will be very advanced, potentially last for decades, withstand all types of weather/terrain, and be another major milestone for the Tesla ecosystem. In theory this battery will support an electric vehicle for 1 million miles and be a major step forward when competing vs. traditional gasoline powered automotive competitors from both an ROI and environmental perspective,\u201d says Wedbush Securities analyst and Tesla bull Dan Ives.While Xpeng doesn\u2019t make its own batteries \u2014 instead partnering with outside industry leaders \u2014 it\u2019s no EV slouch in its own right. The upstart EV maker has two models in the surging China electric car market that have launched to critical acclaim for snazzy infotainment systems and autonomous technology. It has another model on the way in 2021 and more upgrades for its autonomous driving technology.Story continuesThe company is not yet profitable, bur did manage to raise an impressive $1.5 billion in its IPO Thursday amid enthusiasm around the EV industry.Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
