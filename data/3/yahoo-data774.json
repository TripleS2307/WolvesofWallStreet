He warned against bullish near-term market expectations, citing a disconnect between rising equity prices and a sluggish economy.\u201cIt's a fool's errand to go into the market now thinking that it's a bottom and you're going to go up from here,\u201d Rubenstein told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday. \u201cI think there's going to be a lot of ups and downs.\u201d\u201cThe stock market is a forward indicator,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's indicating maybe a year from now that some of these numbers will be justified. But right now, I do think that there is going to be a lot of gyrations between now and a year from now.\u201dRubenstein, who interviews top CEOs on Bloomberg\u2019s \u201cLeadership Live,\u201d says he\u2019s concerned about the drag on the market from stagnant economic performance and widespread unemployment.\u201cThe economy is one where it's lower growth than we had before. It is coming out of a recession,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is one where we have, depending on how you measure, 20 to 30 million people unemployed.\u201d\u201cIn that kind of situation, you shouldn't expect the stock market to be running up to these highs,\u201d Rubenstein says.Since the S&P 500 index (^GSPC) reached a low point on March 23, the index has risen about 40%, as of market close on Wednesday. Over that same period, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) is up 40% and the NASDAQ (^IXIC) more than 53%.The indexes jumped on Wednesday on news that a vaccine made by pharmaceutical company Moderna (MRNA) had produced an immune response against the coronavirus in its first human trial. The encouraging development came amid a rise in coronavirus cases across most of the United States that included a single-day record number of deaths in Florida on Tuesday.Story continuesAs cases have spiked in recent weeks, major states like Texas and California have halted or reversed efforts to reopen their economies.David Rubenstein, Co-Founder & Co-Executive Chairman, The Carlyle Group, speaks onstage during the 2019 Concordia Annual Summit on September 24, 2019 in New York City.
