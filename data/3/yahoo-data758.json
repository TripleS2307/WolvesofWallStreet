Amazon (AMZN), IBM (IBM), and Microsoft (MSFT) have said that they will either put a moratorium on the use of their technology by police \u2014 or are completely exiting the field citing human rights concerns.The technology, which can be used to identify suspects in things like surveillance footage, has faced widespread criticism after studies found it can be biased against women and people of color. And according to at least one expert, there needs to be some form of regulation put in place if these technologies are going to be used by law enforcement agencies.\u201cIf these technologies were to be deployed, I think you cannot do it in the absence of legislation,\u201d explained Siddharth Garg, assistant professor of computer science and engineering at NYU Tandon School of Engineering, told Yahoo Finance.\u201cI think some of this will be challenged in court, and we\u2019ll finally find a solution potentially that balances the risk and the benefits, to whatever extent there are benefits.\u201dWashington County Sheriff's Office Deputy Jeff Talbot demonstrates how his agency used facial recognition software to help solve a crime, at their headquarters in Hillsboro, Ore. (AP Photo/Gillian Flaccus, File)Amazon, IBM, and Microsoft outThe first company to make a move away from offering the technology to law enforcement was IBM. On June 8, CEO Arvind Krishna sent a letter to several lawmakers, including Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Kamala Harris (D-CA), indicating that the company would no longer be developing facial recognition software. The move came in the wake of the death of George Floyd and subsequent protests against police brutality and over-policing.\u201cWe believe now is the time to begin a national dialogue on whether and how facial recognition technology should be employed by domestic law enforcement agencies,\u201d Krishna wrote.\u201cArtificial Intelligence is a powerful tool that can help law enforcement keep citizens safe. But vendors and users of Al systems have a shared responsibility to ensure that Al is tested for bias, particularity when used in law enforcement, and that such bias testing is audited and reported.\u201dStory continuesAmazon followed suit with a June 10 announcement that it was placing a one-year moratorium on the use of its Rekognition technology by law enforcement agencies.Demonstrators hold images of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos near their faces during a Halloween-themed protest at Amazon headquarters over the company's facial recognition system, \"Rekognition,\" Wednesday, Oct. 31, 2018, in Seattle. Protesters said that they were there in support of hundreds of Amazon employees who have signed a letter asking the company to stop marketing their facial recognition software to ICE and to drop its contract with software company Palantir and to law enforcement agencies. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson)\u201cWe\u2019ve advocated that governments should put in place stronger regulations to govern the ethical use of facial recognition technology, and in recent days, Congress appears ready to take on this challenge,\u201d the company said in a statement.\u201cWe hope this one-year moratorium might give Congress enough time to implement appropriate rules, and we stand ready to help if requested.\u201dThe following day at a Washington Post Live event, Microsoft President Brad Smith said the tech giant would also refuse to offer its facial recognition technology to police departments until comprehensive legislation is put in place that regulates the tech.Amazon, IBM, and Microsoft aren\u2019t the only vendors of facial recognition technology. For example, Clearview AI, which came under heavy scrutiny for the way it collected images for its algorithm via Facebook, told Yahoo Finance it will continue to offer its tech to police departments.Facial recognition biasOne of the main criticisms against facial recognition technology\u2019s use by law enforcement is that it can show bias against women and people of color. In a study, MIT\u2019s Joy Buolamwini and the University of Toronto\u2019s Inioluwa Deborah Raji found that Amazon, Microsoft, IBM and software company Megvii were significantly less accurate when identifying women and people of color. Women of color were particularly impacted by the results. Amazon, however, pushed back saying its own studies and customer reactions ran counter to the study\u2019s results.Another study of 189 algorithms from some 99 companies by the National Institute of Standards and Technology found that the majority of the software tested had some form of bias.Massachusetts Institute of Technology facial recognition researcher Joy Buolamwini takes questions from reporters at the school, in Cambridge, Mass. (AP Photo/Steven Senne)According to Garg, bias in facial recognition algorithms crops up due to the data fed to the algorithm. Algorithms \u201clearn\u201d by being provided with massive amounts of information. In the instance of a facial recognition algorithm that may include large batches of photos.If the algorithms are fed more photos of one group over another, it could result in discrepancies in performance.\u201cThe algorithms aren\u2019t biased, but there is bias in the algorithms to be precise,\u201d Garg explained. \u201cThere is well demonstrated evidence of bias in face recognition technology.\u201dA call for legislationThe tech industry is now calling on the federal government to craft legislation regulating facial recognition technologies. But this isn\u2019t the first time the issue has been raised. Senator Booker previously proposed legislation alongside Senator Jeff Merkley (D-OR) calling for a moratorium on the use of facial recognition technology by the federal government until Congress established a legal framework for its use.A recent proposal by Representative Karen Bass (D-CA) that focused on larger police reforms touches on the use of facial recognition technology, but isn\u2019t specifically about the use of such software.Facial recognition technology has already worked its way into different parts of our lives, whether it\u2019s the use of the tech airports, at customs checkpoints, or even in our own smartphones. Whether a full legislative press comes to fruition, however, is very much up in the air.Got a tip?
