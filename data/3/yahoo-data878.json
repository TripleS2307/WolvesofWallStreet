That opening is not so far from the $62 million U.S. opening weekend box office rake of Nolan\u2019s film \u201cInception\u201d in 2010. The top markets for \u201cTenet\u201d were the U.K. and France.But America could tell a different story.Thursday marks the official release of \u201cTenet\u201d in the U.S., which has handled the virus worse than most other countries. The movie is playing only in areas of the country where theaters are open\u2014notably, that does not yet include New York City or Los Angeles.Theaters are allowed to open in 42 states, including Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Colorado, and Ohio. (AMC this week said that 70% of its U.S. theaters will be open in time for Labor Day weekend, news that sent AMC shares soaring.) Some 33,000 theaters (nearly 90% of U.S. theaters) are following \u201cCinemaSafe,\u201d a set of COVID-19 cleaning protocols from the National Association of Theatre Owners, akin to the \u201cSafe Stay\u201d cleaning guidelines that U.S. hotels are using.\u201cWe\u2019re expecting good things [for \u201cTenet\u201d] based on the international markets,\u201d says John Partilla, CEO of Screenvision, which sells the ads and other content that runs before movies in theaters. Partilla cites a recent survey from Atom Tickets in which 74% of U.S. moviegoers said they will feel ready to go see a movie in the first month of theaters reopening in their state.People take their seats inside the Odeon Luxe Leicester Square cinema, on the opening day of the film \"Tenet\", amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, in London, Britain, August 26, 2020.

And with \u201cMulan\u201d hitting Disney+ on Friday, expect industry debate over whether Warner Bros or Disney made the smarter decision.\u2014Daniel Roberts is an editor-at-large at Yahoo Finance.
