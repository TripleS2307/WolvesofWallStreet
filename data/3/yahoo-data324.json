The Postal Service could end up getting $25 billion or $10 billion or nothing from any deal.At the same time, the new Postmaster General is a GOP donor named Louis DeJoy, and one of his first acts in office was to announce operational changes that could lead to delays in mail delivery. The Committee on Oversight and Reform has since asked DeJoy to testify at a hearing in September to examine those changes.On Wednesday afternoon, DeJoy is reportedly set to meet with the White House and Congressional leaders working on the stimulus deal and both storylines are likely to come up.It\u2019s all happening fewer than 100 days ahead of elections poised to generate a surge of mail-in voting, have President Trump\u2019s political opponents increasingly describing Republicans\u2019 actions as \u201csabotage.\u201dI fear Republican sabotage of the USPS, including slowing mail delivery, is a Trump strategy to make voting by mail more difficult this fall. Request your ballots and return them as early as you can. https://t.co/LZONq8EPKE\u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) August 4, 2020Trump has often railed against the USPS and voting by mail. In April, he called the agency \u201ca joke\u201d because of the rates it charges. He has also floated the idea of delaying the election (which he doesn\u2019t have the power to do) because he says mail-in voting poses security issues. (Both of these claims have been refuted by fact checkers.)Mark Dimondstein, president of the American Postal Workers Union, renounced Trump\u2019s claims during an appearance on Yahoo Finance\u2019s The Final Round.\u201d Trump\u2019s \u201ccharges of massive fraud are actually fraudulent themselves,\u201d he said, adding that Trump is \u201cscapegoating\u201d union members, who represent the \u201centire political spectrum.\u201dStory continuesOn Tuesday, however, Trump did a partial about-face, promoting mail-in ballots in Florida, where he votes by mail.Five states have conducted their elections via mail for years, and a range of new states are set to join them in November, with full or partial voting by mail.Whether you call it Vote by Mail or Absentee Voting, in Florida the election system is Safe and Secure, Tried and True. Florida\u2019s Voting system has been cleaned up (we defeated Democrats attempts at change), so in Florida I encourage all to request a Ballot & Vote by Mail! #MAGA\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 4, 2020\u2018Just the opposite of what the Postal Service needs\u2019Leaders in Washington are doing \u201cjust the opposite of what the Postal Service needs,\u201d says Dimondstein, who asserts that \u201cthose votes will be delivered.\u201dFor long-term solvency, Dimondstein wants the Postal Service to receive a grant to help it endure the coronavirus pandemic. He says there is a projected revenue loss of $50 billion over the next 10 years \u201cjust due to COVID.\u201dA USPS postal worker in El Centro, California in July. (Mario Tama/Getty Images)The House-passed HEROES act, which Democrats are currently using as a negotiating marker, included a $25 billion grant. Republicans have shown little interest in the provision, pointing to a $10 billion loan included in the March CARES Act, for which the Treasury Department recently announced it had reached an agreement on disbursing.\u201cThe private sector was largely taken care of,\u201d says Dimondstein, adding that it\u2019s \u201cabout time for Congress to take care of the public sector and something that belongs to all of us and all the people in this country.\u201dNOTE: This post has been updated to include new information.
