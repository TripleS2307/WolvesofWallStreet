But he cautioned that trends in car sales won\u2019t allow Tesla to live up to its market cap, now north of $440 billion.\u201cYou have about five years to grow into that valuation,\u201d says Gabelli, who spoke to Yahoo Finance on Aug. 25, prior to the company\u2019s 5-1 stock split on Monday.Gabelli draws on expertise in the sector, having started his career in the 1970s as an analyst focused on automotive and agricultural equipment.He said he expects an increase in the annual global production of cars in coming years, but emphasized the limited portion of those vehicles likely to be electric.\u201cToday in the world, we're going to produce 80, 90 million,\u201d he says. \u201cBy the year 2025, let's go to 100 million. Are we\u2019re going to have 10%, or 10 million, of those electric?\u201dThe number of cars sold in major markets worldwide fell more than 4% last year to 90.3 million, according to market analysis firm LMC Automotive; meanwhile, IHS Markit projected auto sales will fall 22% year-over-year in 2020 due to the coronavirus.Electric cars made up 2.6% of global sales last year, the International Energy Agency found.The share of overall car sales made up by electric cars is expected to grow over the next decade, but infrastructure changes such as additional charging stations and costs posed by batteries could slow the rise, a JPMorgan Chase note warned in 2018.An analysis by Fortune found that in order for Tesla to justify its heightened valuation it would need to generate $204 billion in annual revenue by 2030, which would amount to 3.5 million electric vehicles sold at $58,000 each. Last year the company reported $24.6 billion in revenue \u2014 and didn\u2019t turn a profit.Story continuesBut Tesla bulls contend the stock has institutional backers beyond retail momentum traders, and the company\u2019s announcement on Tuesday of $5 billion worth of shares raised from 10 top banks suggests the company has support from major lenders.Chairman and CEO of GAMCO Investors, Inc.
