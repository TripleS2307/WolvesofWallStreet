We go in and we oxygenate the economy by breaking that firm up,\u201d he said.\u201cBy the way, as an Amazon and Apple shareholder, I think the value of my shares go up once they announce they\u2019re breaking up,\u201d he said. \u201cI think AWS will be the most valuable company in the world as an independent company in 3-4 years.\u201dStory continuesThe e-commerce giant\u2019s cloud business Amazon Web Services grew 29% year over year.\u201cI do think this is the beginning of the end, even if Trump gets re-elected. I think there\u2019s going to be some action if Biden gets elected \u2014 it will go faster. But we are well past due here to ... oxygenate the marketplace.\u201dGet the advanced data and expert fundamental analysis you can trust with Yahoo Finance Premium.
