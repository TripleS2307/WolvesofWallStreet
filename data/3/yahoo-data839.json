I\u2019m so blessed to be here in the most prosperous country in the world, the greatest country in the world. And we\u2019re so blessed to have you as our leader, as we continue to build this country and make it the most prosperous nation in the world.\u201dGoya, privately-held and based in Jersey City, N.J., was founded in 1936 by Prudencio Unanue, who emigrated from Spain to Puerto Rico and on to New York. Robert Unanue (Prudencio\u2019s grandson) is the third-generation Unanue to run Goya, which touts itself as the largest Hispanic-owned U.S. food company.After briefly relaying that origin story, Unanue also told Trump at the roundtable, \u201cYou are an incredible builder.\u201dGoya Foods CEO and President Bob Unanue speaks prior to US President Donald Trump signing an Executive Order on the White House Hispanic Prosperity Initiative in the Rose Garden at the White House on July 9, 2020. (Photo by JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images)The comments did not land well with a number of prominent people on social media.Julian Castro, the former housing secretary from Texas, tweeted on Thursday night that Goya \u201chas been a staple of so many Latino households for generations. Now their CEO, Bob Unanue, is praising a president who villainizes and maliciously attacks Latinos for political gain. Americans should think twice before buying their products. #Goyaway.\u201dRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, (D-NY), tweeted, \u201cOh look, it\u2019s the sound of me Googling \u2018how to make your own Adobo.\u2019\u201dOh look, it\u2019s the sound of me Googling \u201chow to make your own Adobo\u201d https://t.co/YOScAcyAnC\u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) July 10, 2020Chrissy Teigen, the model and bestselling cookbook author, tweeted about the comments, \u201cF*******CK. A shame. Don\u2019t care how good the beans taste though. Bye bye.\u201d In followup tweets, she added, \u201cThe next step republicans will do (mark my words, they did this with my equinox tweets as well) is say you aren\u2019t supporting the workers if you boycott. You ARE. They should never feel they have to work for someone who agrees Mexicans are \u2018vile\u2019 \u2018rapists\u2019 - F*CK this guy.\u201dStory continues#BoycottGoya was the No. 2 trending topic on Twitter by Friday morning.The comments by Unanue and the resulting backlash are reminiscent of what happened to Under Armour founder Kevin Plank when he said on CNBC, one month into the Trump presidency, \u201cTo have such a pro-business president is something that\u2019s a real asset for this country... There\u2019s a lot that I respect there.\u201d Under Armour sponsored athletes including Steph Curry and Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson posted on social media condemning Plank\u2019s comments.The speed of the backlash to Unanue\u2019s praise for Trump is also yet another sign of the current politically-charged cultural moment, in which consumer-facing brands that for years tried to remain apolitical are finding themselves in the crosshairs either because of one executive\u2019s support of Trump (see: Equinox and Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross) or a brand\u2019s sponsorship of a sports league or team (see: FedEx and the Washington Redskins).Goya declined to comment on the social media reaction to Unanue\u2019s comments about Trump, but Unanue doubled down on his comments in an interview on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d on Friday, saying: \u201cYou make a positive comment, all of a sudden that's not acceptable? If you're called by the President of the United States, you're going to say, \u2018No, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m busy, no thank you?\u2019 I didn\u2019t say that to the Obamas and I didn\u2019t say that to President Trump.\"Unanue called the backlash to his comments \u201csuppression of speech.\u201dAt the White House event, Unanue also announced that Goya will donate 1 million cans of chickpeas and 1 million pounds of other food products to American food banks to help families hurt by the pandemic.\u2014Daniel Roberts is an editor-at-large at Yahoo Finance.
