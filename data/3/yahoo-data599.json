And I think this is something that is going to be followed by other tech companies,\u201d said Ives.Apple has almost $200 billion on cash, which Ives says will be used for more share buybacks and eventually, an acquisition.\u201cI still do believe that they buy a studio for their streaming business in the next 3-6 months,\u201d said Ives. He believes Apple could be eying Lionsgate, MGM, or Sony Studios.\u201cThose are the ones to me that fit the bill and check every box. Look at streaming and content. That\u2019s the thing, they built a mansion, but they just don\u2019t have furniture in terms of content.\u201dAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos testifies before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law hearing on \"Online Platforms and Market Power\" in the Rayburn House office Building on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC on July 29, 2020.

Amazon posted a record profit as people stayed and shopped at home.\u201cAmazon right now, they\u2019re seeing massive tailwinds in e-commerce as well as cloud. Right now it\u2019s really their world and everyone else is paying rent in terms of e-commerce,\u201d said Ives.The better-than-expected earnings came on the heels of anti-trust congressional hearings a day earlier.\u201cI think it\u2019s just got for Bezos ... that they did the regulatory hearings the day before earnings and not the day after earnings, just giving these types of numbers,\u201d said Ives.Get the advanced data and expert fundamental analysis you can trust with Yahoo Finance Premium.
