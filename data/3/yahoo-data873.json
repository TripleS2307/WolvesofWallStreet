This is the group most at risk from COVID-19 and the most wary of coming back an office or another public setting.If they can avoid it that is.A recent study by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College examined the differences in the ability to work from home by age.The report found that for many older Americans, \u201ctheir ability to survive financially will depend on their ability to work from home.\u201dThe good news is that older workers have jobs that allow them to work from home at roughly the same rate as their younger counterparts.\u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be large differences on average across age groups,\u201d said Anqi Chen, one of the report\u2019s authors, during an appearance on Yahoo Finance.But \u201cthe bad news is that over half of older workers don\u2019t have jobs that can be done at home,\u201d Chen said.The report, \u201cCan Older Workers Work from Home?,\u201d was co-authored with Alicia H. Munnell and found that 41% of Americans aged 25-34 work in jobs that can be performed remotely. That number rises gradually by age, and 47% of workers aged 65+ are in a similar position.The research was done by analyzing job types based on the potential of it being done from home. For example, jobs primarily done outside or don\u2019t involve email were categorized as ones where working from home is not a possibility.A sign in Washington D.C as business across the country gradually reopen.

Chen appeared as part of Yahoo Finance\u2019s ongoing partnership with the Funding our Future campaign, a group of organizations advocating for increased retirement security for Americans.The researchers found that the ability to work from home was vastly different when measured by education or income. Across all ages, Americans with more education or higher earnings have many more options as they weigh whether or not to resume working from an office or another setting.Story continuesThis prospect \u2013 having to choose between maintaining your income or stepping back to preserve your health \u2013 could have the biggest impact on these older workers.Any loss in income would come during years of peaking earning power. Chen has also studied workers who lost their jobs during the Great Recession a decade ago and found that they were \u201cnever able to catch up.\u201dTo make matters more challenging, even before the recession, \u201cwe see that about half of older workers approaching retirement didn\u2019t have enough saved up to maintain their standard of living\u201d Chen said.Ben Werschkul is a producer for Yahoo Finance in Washington, DC.Read more:American savings accounts are now \u2018steadily declining\u2019 as coronavirus effects lingerWhy a \u2018vast majority\u2019 of Americans are not getting the most out of Social SecurityReport lays out how the gender pay gap becomes a retirement wealth gapRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit."}]}
