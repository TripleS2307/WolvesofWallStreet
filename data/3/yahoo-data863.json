Second quarter U.S. same-store sales surged 16.1%, beating analysts' estimates of 10.67%.The world's largest pizza company said consumers' ordering behavior during the pandemic led to the sharp rise in numbers.Domino's also introduced a new contactless carside delivery option for carryout orders, which allow diners to choose where they would like their order placed \u2013 the passenger side, back seat or the trunk of their car.'Drive-thru' has been a major hit for other fast-food chains as well, such as McDonald's <MCD.N> and Burger King <QSR.TO>.Several casual restaurants in the country are now pivoting to a delivery model to keep their business running amid uncertainties.For Domino's, total revenue rose 13.4% to $920 million in the quarter ended June 14 from a year earlier, above the expectation of $911.5 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.Net income rose 28.5% to $118.7 million. On a per share basis, the company earned $2.99, beating the estimate by 75 cents.International same-store sales rose 1.3%, and beat estimates of 0.65%.Separately, the company also said Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Lawrence would retire after more than 20 years of service.(Reporting by Nivedita Balu in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli and Rashmi Aich)"}]}
