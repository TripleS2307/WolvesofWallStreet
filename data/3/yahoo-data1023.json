Trump\u2019s cash on hand equals a staggering $265 million, compared to the less than $150 million in Biden\u2019s coffers.According to the Trump campaign, the president has pulled in over $800 million for this election cycle, nearing the $1 billion figure campaign manager Brad Parscale promised that Trump would raise and spend to ensure victory in the November election.Trump\u2019s May fundraising haul represents an uptick of over $12 million from the April totals.\u201cPresident Trump's consistent leadership and unprecedented actions during this challenging time has undoubtedly resonated with the American people,\u201d said RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel.Democratic presidential candidate, former Vice President Joe Biden arrives for a meeting with small business owners, Wednesday, June 17, 2020, in Yeadon, Pa.

According to the campaign, over half of May donors were new, and online donors have tripled since February.The large sums come as the presumptive Democratic nominee has experienced a surge in the polls. Currently, Biden leads Trump in the national polls by 8.9 points.Despite Biden\u2019s current popularity, he has struggled with fundraising, often lagging behind other Democratic presidential candidates like Senators Bernie Sanders (I-VA) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).Story continuesBy the third quarter of last year, despite a strong start in fundraising, Biden\u2019s campaign had less than $10 million in its coffers.\u201cJust a few months ago, people were ready to write this campaign off,\u201d Biden said in a statement. \u201cNow, we are making huge dents in Donald Trump\u2019s war chest. Every single dollar is going to make sure he is only a one-term president.\u201dKristin Myers is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
