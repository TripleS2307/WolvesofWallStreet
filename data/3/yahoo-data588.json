(AP Photo/David Zalubowski)\u201cBut of course you could see some price appreciation from investors basically misunderstanding it, thinking that it might be cheaper,\u201d she added.The split does not change the fundamentals or valuation of the company. Shares at a lower price point are seen as a as a way to make them more accessible to individual investors.\u201cThe long term story with Tesla, our thesis is still intact,\u201d said Keeney. \u201cOur expected value for Tesla by 2024 is still $7,000.\u201dKeeney says COVID-19 has solidified Tesla\u2019s lead in the electric vehicle space, as the pandemic has slowed down efforts by other manufacturers working on EV.\u201cIf you think of a traditional automaker who is investing in electric vehicles \u2014 and basically how they\u2019re going to handle that when their core business has really been sinking,\u201d said Keeney, \u201cIt\u2019s not their core expertise.\u201d\u201cOn the autonomous front we still see Tesla [with] much more skill than any other automaker, than any start-up because it\u2019s using its customer fleet to collect data,\u201d she said.\u201cWe think it\u2019s a leader in electric vehicles and full autonomy and we think it\u2019s 3 to 4 years ahead of the competition on that front.\u201dTesla\u2019s latest 2nd quarter results announced in July beat expectations. The company posted a fourth consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability making the stock eligible to be considered for inclusion in to the S&P 500 (^GSPC).Get the advanced data and expert fundamental analysis you can trust with Yahoo Finance Premium.
