Gretchen Whitmer has emerged as one of 2020\u2019s most prominent Democrats (who isn\u2019t running for president). She popped up as a respondent to the State of the Union in February and as a finalist in Joe Biden\u2019s VP search more recently. Along the way, she has been the recipient of many presidential taunts on social media.She is set to help open the Democratic National Convention on Monday night as one of the primetime speakers. Before her speech, she sat down virtually with Yahoo Finance\u2019s Andy Serwer for a wide-ranging conversation about the themes to watch in her speech, whether Joe Biden has an insurmountable lead in her state, and how Michigan\u2019s economy is coming back from the coronavirus.\u201cThere's a lot to accomplish here,\u201d she says of what she plans to do with her limited time on Monday night. In addition to touting her party\u2019s standard bearers, she is hoping to \u201cfocus on those who have sacrificed their own health to take care of others,\u201d including front-line responders who may struggle with PTSD symptoms even after the pandemic recedes.Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer in May.

Whitmer hopes that the all-virtual proceeding \u201ccan show the American people life continues on if we can stay smart, stay safe and do what we need to do.\u201dWhitmer offered repeated praise of Sen. Kamala Harris, the newly minted Vice Presidential candidate. At one point Whitmer, who just days ago had been in contention to join, noted that \u201cmy kids are excited about this ticket.\u201d\u2018I don't think anyone should take Michigan for granted\u2019Whitmer swept into office in 2018 by almost 10 points after Trump\u2019s narrow victory in the state two years earlier. She\u2019s confident that Biden can win Michigan, but says of polls that have shown a big Biden lead: \u201cI don't buy it for a second, to be honest.\u201dRecent polls have shown Biden with a lead between 11 points or 4 or 5 points in Michigan. \u201cI feel good, but I don't think anyone should take Michigan for granted,\u201d says Whitmer.Story continuesGovernor Whitmer, left appeared with Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker and former Vice President Joe Biden in March. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post via Getty Images)Much of her unease comes from the questions around the Postal Service and America\u2019s voting infrastructure that have exploded into public view in recent weeks.President Trump has repeatedly claimed \u2013 with little evidence \u2013 that voting-by-mail will lead to widespread fraud and reports from around the country in recent days have shown that that new Postmaster General, a prominent Trump supporter, is retiring mail sorting machines and slowing down the mail so much that many voters could be disenfranchised even if they mail in their ballots by the state deadlines.Washington Democrats are hoping to hold hearings on the Postal Service and the election as early as next week.Michigan, meanwhile, is moving forward with plans to send applications for mail-in ballots to all registered voters. Whitmer says \u201cthere's an enthusiasm that is real\u201d for Biden and Harris, but she\u2019s concerned whether those votes will be counted.\u201cIf the USPS is not reliable \u2013 or is being undermined \u2013 that constitutional right we have afforded people is undermined,\u201d she says, adding that she is exploring legal options with her state\u2019s Attorney General and Secretary of State.Protestors try to enter the Michigan House of Representative chamber in April to protest Governor Whitmer's mandatory closure of businesses to curtail COVID-19.

The state has kept caseloads relatively low and recently announced plans to re-open schools across the state.\u201cWe didn't get bullied and we didn't get, you know, drawn into political arguments,\u201d Whitmer says of her administration\u2019s response in the face of pressure from many right-wing groups, often encouraged by President Trump, to open faster.\u201cBut this can crop up fast,\u201d Whitmer warned of a second wave. The gains are \u201call very precarious.\u201dBen Werschkul is a producer for Yahoo Finance in Washington, DC.Graphic by Yahoo FinanceRead more:\u2018We see it here every day\u2019: How a slowdown in the Postal Service is impacting small businessesTrump\u2019s worst campaign promiseSummers says stocks 'do better' during Democratic administrationsRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit."}]}
