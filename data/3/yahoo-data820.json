Despite a slowdown in global auto sales \u2014 especially in the EV market \u2014 in first-half 2020 amid the coronavirus crisis, NIO managed to achieve record-high monthly deliveries in May 2020. Notably, NIO registered monthly deliveries of 3,434 units in May. Sales skyrocketed 215.5% year over year on solid demand for ES6 and ES8 models.However, the company has been bearing the brunt of operational inefficiency for the past several quarters.
