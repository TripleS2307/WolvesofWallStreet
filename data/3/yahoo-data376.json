Investors with at least $2,500 can claim a stake in Jamestown Invest\u2019s portfolio of urban properties, including Southern Dairies, a historic five-building, 79,000-square-foot office campus in Atlanta.\u201cWe are connecting ordinary people to opportunities they wouldn\u2019t have otherwise,\u201d said Howard Marks, co-founder and CEO of StartEngine, explaining that the traditional vehicle for real estate investment, REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts), don\u2019t offer the asset classes wealthy investors have access to in the private equity market.\u201cWe are connecting ordinary people to opportunities they wouldn\u2019t have otherwise,\u201d said Howard Marks.The collaboration is part of a larger trend toward micro-investment in private equity real estate, especially among millennials. Other crowdfunding apps like Compound also facilitate investments in private equity, but the StartEngine-Jamestown collaboration is the biggest real estate crowdfunding opportunity yet, the companies said.\u201cMillennials and Gen Z are maturing into active investors. They\u2019re digitally native and proficient in ways that create opportunities \u2014 and require investment vehicles, managers and platforms to become more calibrated to the way they [young people] want to invest,\u201d said Michael Phillips, principal and president of Jamestown, the parent company of Jamestown Invest.The collaboration also takes advantage of a wave of new investors during the pandemic. In the second quarter, StartEngine more than doubled the value of investments on its platform, adding 30,000 new investors, said Marks. The rising interest mirrors the rise of Robinhood, a California-based democratized investment app, which gained over 3 million funded accounts in 2020, according to its most recent blog post on May 4.Story continues\u201cYou could argue it\u2019s the worst time to be investing, but it turns out it\u2019s not \u2014 it\u2019s one of the best times. During the pandemic, people are making investments and diversifying,\u201d said Phillips. \u201cThe coronavirus has accelerated the use of technology in the choices we make today\u2026 All of this is an acceleration of trends that were happening already.\u201dSarah Paynter is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
