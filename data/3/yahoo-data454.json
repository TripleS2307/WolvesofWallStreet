All of this has significant political and investment implications, especially since the analysts see the situation deteriorating further in the near-term.Students march on Westminster Bridge holding a placard saying \"It's not OK boomer\" during the \"Fridays for Future\" climate change rally on February 14, 2020 in London, England.

Housing prices continue to remain high and prevent younger people from having the real estate opportunities to accumulate wealth as older generations have done. Education costs and student loan debt have ballooned while wages have not. The climate crisis has not been addressed in a meaningful way either. All of this has been aggravated by Covid-19, Deutsche Bank says, which has hurt younger generations more than the older ones even though the virus has had the opposite effect.Another aggravating factor: People are living longer, which has made the aging populations tilt \u201cthe balance further against the young,\u201d analysts wrote.3 ways the problem could play outDeutsche Bank outlined three scenarios that could result from the conflict.First, asset prices could fall, \"narrowing the generational divide without external intervention.\" A decrease in housing prices or the stock market could result as older generations sell their homes to fund their retirement. This dynamic would also mean the labor market would be smaller, pushing up wages for younger workers.Story continuesThis, Deutsche Bank says, would be a \u201cnatural resolution,\u201d though potentially one with \u201cserious consequences\u201d for investors since it involves hits to asset prices. The resolution would calm the conflict as younger people could envision how their generation succeeds.\u201cHowever, this relies on an as-yet unknown force to boost the global economy,\u201d the analysts wrote.(Deutsche Bank)The second, also with similar \u201cserious consequences,\u201d would be having elected leaders with redistributionist policies. This would result in shakeups in asset prices, tax systems, and climate policy.\u201cThis scenario becomes more likely towards the end of this decade as Millennial and younger voters start to exceed those in older generations,\u201d Deutsche Bank wrote. The analysts mention that politicians like Sen. Bernie Sanders haven\u2019t won the presidency yet, but they are a growing force.The Deutsche Bank analysts\u2019 third option, which it sees as Goldilocks-esque, isn\u2019t built in crisis or revolution, but rather on compromise.\u201cTo avoid these two scenarios and their serious consequences for asset markets, a scenario of gradual resolution may be achieved if policymakers seek to redress the balance over time,\u201d the analysts wrote. \u201cThis could include policies such as higher taxes on wealth or unearned income.\u201dIn the bank\u2019s view, a society that doesn\u2019t address the legitimate needs and demands of a huge part of its population is headed for serious problems \u2013 something that\u2019s been proven time and time again by countries that have gone through political revolution and those that have not by addressing malcontent head-on.--Ethan Wolff-Mann is a writer at Yahoo Finance focusing on consumer issues, personal finance, retail, airlines, and more.
