Furthermore, they are not afraid to spend money to produce content and create deals with some of the most interesting and dynamic filmmakers in the business,\u201d he said.Netflix's strong original titles like 'Ozark' have helped catapult the platform to streaming dominance\u201cNetflix has become a real force to be reckoned with so this [record-breaking moment] shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise,\u201d he added.The platform has relied on strong originals like \u201cOzark,\u201d \u201cThe Crown,\u201d \u201cDead to Me,\u201d and \u201c Stranger Things\u201d to boost subscriber growth. It recently doubled down on its estimated $17 billion content bet by promoting Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos to co-CEO.Sarandos, who frequently strikes up partnerships with TV studios and production houses, is known as the behind-the-scenes dealmaker for the streamer. He is largely seen as the unofficial face of Netflix \u2014 especially in Hollywood.But just because Netflix seems lightyears ahead of the competition (at least at the current moment), doesn\u2019t mean other streamers can\u2019t catch-up.\u201cNetflix is not an overnight success story,\u201d Dergarabedian said \u2014 noting how the company initially started out as a pay-for-use DVD rental company.\u201cWho could have imagined that a decade later they would be sitting atop a mountain of Emmy nominations, [but growth] takes time and these other streamers will all be players because they all have the capacity and resources to attract great talent,\u201d he explained.Both Disney+ (DIS) and Apple TV+ (AAPL), newbies in the ever-evolving streaming wars, secured multiple Emmy nods on Tuesday \u2014 scoring 19 and 18 nominations, respectively.Story continuesBoth platforms made their debuts less than one year ago, in November 2019.Streaming platforms bust into 2020 Emmys raceFurthermore, in arguably one the biggest surprises of the day, Disney\u2019s \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d snagged a coveted nomination for Best Drama.\u201cEmmy nominations on this level will make people stay with a particular service,\u201d Dergarabedian said.\u201cAll services have a shot but each one is at a different point in their individual timeline \u2014 some are in infancy, others are in full force and then there are those that are still yet to come.\u201dStreaming \u201cis very much a meritocracy. At the end of the day it all comes down to quality...the content has to be good no matter what platform,\u201d he concluded.Alexandra is a Producer & Entertainment Correspondent at Yahoo Finance.
