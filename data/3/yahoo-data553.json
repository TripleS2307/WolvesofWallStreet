This is why we take action in court, why we stand up for our values, and why we will remain vigilant in protecting our international students from these harmful disruptions.\u201dOn July 6, new U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) guidelines were announced that detailed that F1 and M1 international students in the U.S. who were taking their courses completely online didn\u2019t have a reason to be in the U.S. Schools had until Wednesday to adjust their plans.President Donald J.

Consequently, international students can stay in the U.S. for the duration of their study in the fall, even if their school is entirely online.\u201cThere were rumors that the policy would be scaled back to new internationals only, so I\u2019m elated that it was rescinded completely,\u201d Jenny Lee, a professor of higher education at University of Arizona who studies higher education, told Yahoo Finance.Story continuesHowever, Lee wasn\u2019t convinced that it was all over just yet: \u201c[T]his was just one among a long string of many anti-immigrant policies over the recent years. So we should anticipate this as not being the end, but a pause before another attack on international higher education soon.Brendan Cantwell, associate professor at Michigan State University who studies politics in higher education, told Yahoo Finance that the flip-flopping by ICE could have larger implications.\u201cThis shows that the government didn\u2019t understand how higher education works, had no plan to implement and enforce the guidance, and had no choice but to back down in the face of overwhelming opposition from the higher education sector,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt is welcome news and a great relief to universities and international students alike ... [but] we should not think of this as having been cost-free.\u201dUltimately, according to Cantwell, the administration\u2019s \u201cchaotic approach to policymaking and the unwelcoming message the guidance sent could cause lasting damage between U.S. higher education and students around the world.\u201dAttorney General Maura Healey and international students rally at the State House against ICE visa rules on July 13, 2020 in Boston.

However, the school needed to certify their status to the government.Only 8% of colleges have thus far planned for a completely online fall semester and 2.1% are \u201cwaiting to decide,\u201d according to data compiled by the Chronicle of Higher Education.Lawmakers panned the guidance from ICE, labeling it as xenophobic and misguided.\u201cEssentially, what is is is about, is two things: One, the Trump administration has always been about anti-foreigner, anti-immigrant policies and this is another example of that,\u201d Healey, the Massachusetts attorney general, told Yahoo Finance\u2019s On The Move. \u201cSecond, this is about Donald Trump trying to find a way to show that come September, everything is okay in this country and that we beat coronavirus.\u201dThis decision, \u201cagainst all the weight of the evidence of any public health expert\u201d and \u201cany second grader\u201d puts the higher education at risk, she asserted.The state had filed a lawsuit, along with 17 others, and the District of Columbia, calling the policy \u201csenseless and cruel.\u201d California had filed a few days prior, as well as Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which was resolved today.ICE is rescinding its rule that threatens to deport international students, a day after we filed our lawsuit.This is why we sue. The rule was illegal and the Trump Administration knew they didn\u2019t have a chance.They may try this again. We will be ready.\u2014 Maura Healey (@MassAGO) July 14, 2020\u2018That\u2019s actually illegal\u2019On Monday, ICE had responded to Harvard lawsuit \u2014 which has dozens of amicus briefs from U.S. tech companies to other universities \u2014 in court filings, arguing that the possibility of national security risks that students staying in the U.S. could pose.Furthermore, the policy was apparently being enforced as students attempting to re-enter the country were being turned back.One South Korean student who attends DePaul University in Chicago was reportedly stopped at the airport in San Francisco because he had not signed up for classes.\u201cI am aware of one instance in Massachusetts where a student was stopped at the airport,\u201d Healey said. \u201cWe want all of those instances reported to us \u2026 this is an administration that is ignoring the rule of law.\u201dAnd by offering \u201cno data in support, no sound policy reason or explanation \u2026 [is] under the Administrative Procedures Act, and under U.S. law \u2014 that\u2019s actually illegal,\u201d she asserted. \u201cYou can\u2019t make rules that way.\u201dNurses from Haiti attend a training program at Regis College.
