That implies a very anemic U-shape recovery,\" Roubini told \u201cThe Ticker\" in a broad discussion on Monday.And Roubini \u2014 whose bearish predictions have earned him the nickname of \"Dr. Doom\u201d \u2014 expects a tepid recovery to eventually morph into a depression even more severe than the 1930s.While the recovery will start to look like a \u2018V\u2019 at the start, it will \"soon go into a U,\" the economist added. There's also a risk of a \u2018W\u2019, with growth sinking into a double-dip recession if COVID-19 infection rates continue to spike, prompting more lockdowns and pushing the economy into a new contraction.Roubini's bearish prediction for a U-shaped recovery goes back to the considerable number of the debt-laden, highly leveraged firms. While the Federal Reserve\u2019s aggressive monetary policy has helped postpone the day of reckoning, at least of these \u201czombies\u201d will eventually go broke.For some of these businesses to avoid bankruptcy, they'll have to spend less and save more by capping capital expenditures and slashing jobs.\"If you have to spend less, what is your major cost? It's your labor cost, and they're slashing jobs like we've never seen before. We've lost more jobs in three months than in the last ten years,\" Roubini added.When companies rehire, rather than bringing back full-time jobs with full wages and benefits, they'll opt for more part-time, contractor, and gig workers, according to Roubini.Story continuesISTANBUL, TURKEY - NOVEMBER 26: Nouriel Roubini, professor of economics at New York University speaks during an exclusive interview on Turkey's economy and global markets within the 28th Quality Congress in Istanbul, Turkey on November 26, 2019.

So firms have to increase savings and reduce investment,\u201d he explained.\u201cHouseholds are going to have less income because either you are still jobless or if you have a job, it's going to be more precarious. So, you have to spend less and be more risk-averse,\u201d he added. As a result, households will spend less on big-ticket items, discretionary spending, and buying a new home.A \u2018Greater Depression\u2019While the U-shaped recovery is his view in the near-term, Roubini worries about a depression over the medium term, in the form of an \u2018L-shaped\u2019 recovery.\"I think the sequence is V to U to W, to eventually by the middle of the decade an L,\" the economist told Yahoo Finance. And it gets worse: Roubini suggested the turmoil stemming from the coronavirus pandemic will lead to a years-long retrenchment that will rival the Great Depression.\"I've always said that my prediction for a \u2018Greater Depression\u2019 is not about 2020, but the decade of the 2020s, sometime by the middle of the decade,\" he said.There are \"ten deadly drivers\" behind his Greater Depression thesis \u2014 which include high levels of debt, aging societies, cheap currencies and a strategic rivalry between the world\u2019s two largest economies that\u2019s getting worse every day.@jamescrabtree. 10 Deadly D's Drive 2020s Depression: Debt, Demographics, Deflation, Debasement, Digital Disruption, De-globalization, Democracy Backlash, Duopolistic Strategic Rivalry, Digital/Tech Warfare, Deadly Disasters (Pandemics, GCC).
