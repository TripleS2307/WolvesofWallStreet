This would include removing coverage for those with pre-existing conditions.\u201cA global pandemic does not change what Americans know \u2014 Obamacare has been an unlawful failure,\u201d White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement, adding that it \u201cforces Americans to purchase unaffordable plans.\u201dPresident Trump claims that the aim is to replace Obamacare with a more efficient alternative, although his administration has not presented a serious alternative since failing on \u201cTrumpcare\u201d in 2017.Now that the very expensive, unpopular and unfair Individual Mandate provision has been terminated by us, many States & the U.S. are asking the Supreme Court that Obamacare itself be terminated so that it can be replaced with a FAR BETTER AND MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE ALTERNATIVE.....\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 27, 2020If the ACA were to be overturned or dismantled, at least 20 million people would lose health care coverage, according to the Urban Institute. And that estimation didn\u2019t factor in those who were hit by layoffs as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. A Kaiser Family Foundation report estimated that at least 27 million Americans have lost employer-sponsored health coverage during the pandemic, meaning that many of them could have also signed up for the ACA.\u201cA significant portion of the U.S. population relies on this as their primary means of health care coverage,\u201d Johns Hopkins Medicine Assistant Professor Lauren Sauer said on Yahoo Finance\u2019s The Ticker (video above). \u201cAs we\u2019re also hearing the administration talk about reducing the support for things like COVID testing and then these things happening in tandem \u2026 it\u2019s really concerning, political or not, to think about reducing people\u2019s ability to access health care coverage in the midst of it.\u201dStory continuesColorado Governor Jared Polis (C) wears a face mask as U.S. President Donald Trump makes remarks during a meeting in the Cabinet Room of the White House, May 13, 2020 in Washington, DC.

Judge Reed O\u2019Connor agreed with the plaintiffs who argued that the lack of a penalty invalidated the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d provision of the law, and if that part of the law was now invalid, then the whole law was.Following that ruling, Democratic states and the House of Representatives filed an appeal, which made its way to the Supreme Court in a case titled California v. Texas. Although no oral arguments have been scheduled yet, a decision is expected to be made by spring 2021.\u201cThe bottom line is if they overturn it, and they overturn it in a way to say the next day basically it\u2019s over \u2026 the reality is dramatically more people would be uninsured,\u201d Chris Meekins, Raymond James health care policy analyst, said on Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade, \u201cunless Congress takes action to pass something new to replace it.\u201dIsabel Diaz Tinoco (L) and Jose Luis Tinoco look at a computer as Otto Hernandez shows them the different insurance plans available under the Affordable Care Act.

Many versions of the bill were proposed until a major vote was finally called for the Health Care Freedom Act, which many described as \u201ca skinny repeal\u201d of Obamacare. It failed to pass the Senate, however, after the late Sen. John McCain voted against it, proving to be the decisive vote.\u201cRepublicans are assuming that if the Affordable Care Act is struck down by the Supreme Court, that would bring Republicans and Democrats together because no one wants to see 20 million-plus-more people uninsured,\u201d Meekins said. \u201cI think that is an ambitious goal. We saw that really both parties are not working together on health care.\u201dAccording to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), approximately 487,000 people gained coverage through a special enrollment period from the ACA, which is a 46% increase year over year.U.S. President Barack Obama (R) and Vice President Joe Biden walk back to the Oval Office after speaking about the Supreme Court ruling to uphold the nationwide availability of tax subsidies that are crucial to the implementation of the ACA.
