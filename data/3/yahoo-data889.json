As of August 18, twenty of the 25 largest school districts decided to do remote learning. The U.S. positivity rate is currently 6.5%, with variations by state and county.There are over 5.1 million coronavirus cases in the U.S. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)New York City, which has a positivity rate of 0.71%, opted for a hybrid plan while big districts like Los Angeles and Chicago have decided to stay put as positivity rate remain high.For some districts \u2014 New York aside \u2014 if they choose to open, \u201cafter a week or two, you're going to get a bunch of cases,\u201d Dr. Spencer said.And even in the Big Apple, there\u2019s trepidation: The number of families opting for remote learning has reportedly jumped by 40,000 in the past week.Earlier this month, a Georgia school district said it was closing three high schools after multiple students tested positive for coronavirus. Other schools have planned to reopen but had to quickly reverse their strategy after staff members tested positive for the virus.A student is sitting in a classroom.

We got to open up,\u201d Trump said last week during a White House briefing. \u201cWe got to open up our schools and open up our businesses. And a lot of it has been open, but we can do better.\u201dThe CDC has issued some guidance on how schools can reopen. But at the same time, the CDC released new guidance on Friday that noted a surge in coronavirus cases in children.\u201cThe number and rate of cases in children in the United States have been steadily increasing from March to July 2020,\u201d CDC stated. However, the \u201ctrue incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is not known due to lack of widespread testing and the prioritization of testing for adults and those with severe illness.\u201d\u2014Aarthi Swaminathan is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering education.
