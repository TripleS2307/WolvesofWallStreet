Cheri Bustos (D-IL) is blasting President Donald Trump for \u201cdoing everything he can to undermine people\u2019s confidence in our democracy.\u201d\u201cThat is a sin. We\u2019ve got the longest lasting democracy on the face of the planet,\u201d said Bustos in an interview with Yahoo Finance. \u201cI don\u2019t even think it\u2019s arguable that this is the preferred form of government \u2014 a democratic form of government. For anybody, especially the president of the United States, to undermine the confidence in the best form of government in the world is just unconscionable. It\u2019s a sin.\u201dDemocratic lawmakers have sounded the alarm in recent weeks, saying that Trump is trying to make it harder for people to vote with his attacks on the United States Postal Service, his opposition to additional USPS funding and his unproven claims that mail-in voting would lead to significant voter fraud (experts say voting fraud is very rare). On Tuesday night, the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee sued New Jersey over its mail-in voting plans.\u201cAbsentee is great, but universal [mail-in voting] is going to be a disaster, the likes of which our country has never seen. It'll end up being a rigged election, or they will never come out with an outcome,\u201d Trump said on Tuesday.Vote by mail-in ballot at the Supervisor of Elections office on election day during the 2020 Primary Election on August 18, 2020 in Palm Beach, Florida.

She\u2019s tasked with supporting Democratic candidates and expanding the House majority.\u201cThe reason Donald Trump wants to undermine the postal service \u2014 and he even said it, to get in the way of people's voting rights \u2014 is absurd. If there's anything that we should do is we should make voting easy for people. We shouldn't be throwing up these barricades,\u201d said Bustos in an interview before the New Jersey lawsuit was announced.White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows brushed off the idea that Trump is purposefully trying to slow the mail to try and help his reelection bid.Story continues\"This president believes that the American people, casting their ballot, one at a time, will ultimately make sure that he's the one elected on Nov. 3 \u2014 and any postal consideration has nothing to do with any ballot initiative or anything else. He wants to make the post office great again,\u201d he told White House pool reporter Mike Shear on Tuesday.After being called to Capitol Hill for emergency oversight hearings and Democratic attorneys general threatened legal action, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy \u2014 a Trump donor\u2014 paused controversial changes that voting rights advocates and lawmakers said could disenfranchise voters in the election. DeJoy said he put the changes on hold to \u201cavoid even the appearance of any impact on election mail.\u201dWhile Democratic lawmakers welcome the news, they still worry about changes that have already been made.\u201cThis pause only halts a limited number of the postmaster\u2019s changes, does not reverse damage already done, and alone is not enough to ensure voters will not be disenfranchised by the president this fall,\u201d said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) in a statement.Later this week, the House will vote on legislation to prohibit recent USPS changes and provide the agency with $25 billion.\u201cI really do believe that our democracy is at stake. I really do believe that,\u201d Bustos said. \u201cSitting on the sidelines and not participating in this election is really not something that any of us can afford to do.\u201dJessica Smith is a reporter for Yahoo Finance based in Washington, D.C.
