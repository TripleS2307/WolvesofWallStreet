(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)In the wake of the 2008 Financial Crisis, nearly 300,000 jobs were shed from the public education sector, according to one estimate. In the first two months of the coronavirus-induced economic crisis of 2020, around 750,000 public school teachers and other school employees in local areas have been laid off, according to one estimate by the American Federation of Teachers.\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure this was unprecedented,\u201d Michael Madowitz, an economist at the Center for American Progress, told Yahoo Finance in June. \u201cWe\u2019re already past the total state and local job losses of the last recession.\u201d(GRAPHIC: EPI)The Education industry bounced back a bit in June as private education added 93,000 jobs and government education added 70,000. The question over the following months and years is how many teachers are hired back and how many choose to leave the profession.\u201cIt\u2019s honestly very tough,\u201d said Rosanna Deserto, a second grade teacher from Brooklyn, who is considering leaving the profession after 15 years of teaching.Story continues\u201cI actually said to my husband the other day I wanted to do my side business full time,\u201d Deserto added, referring to a multi-level marketing company that she works with. \u201cI could make it work. However, the no benefits may hurt us financially.\u201dA Boston Public School teacher teaches her kindergarten class via video-conference from her apartment in Boston, Massachusetts, in April 2020.

Ryan/The Boston Globe via Getty Images)Jennings said she\u2019s heard stories about students not showing up to remote classes or being unable to attend because of spotty internet connection of lack of computer access.\u201cThere are places where I heard \u2014 and this was in Louisville, Kentucky where I'm doing some work \u2014 there are hubs, like internet hubs, around school,\u201d she explained. \u201cSo parents are taking their kids in a car to a place where they can get WiFi near the school to do their work, like to do school. But how many parents have the ability to do that? Right?\u201dAll things consider, teaching through the pandemic \u201chas really taken an Herculean effort to get these schools to shift this way,\u201d Jennings added. \u201cWe haven't done a good enough job of preparing for another shutdown or continued shutdown. And at the same time we haven't done a good enough job managing the coronavirus.\u201dNew Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island, West Virginia, and Oklahoma are seeing a surge in cases.

(PHOTO: REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst)\u201cAbsent a federal lifeline, the growing state and local education budget gap would result in a total of 1,356,000 job losses\u20141 million in preK-12 and 400,000 in higher education, about 432,000 more than have been lost to date,\u201d the report stated.The AFT on Monday also sued Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, Commissioner Richard Corcoran, the Florida Department of Education, the Florida State Board of Education and the Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez to \u201cstop the reckless and unsafe reopening of public school campuses as coronavirus infections surge statewide.\u201d Florida is a worsening coronavirus hotspot.\u201cIt's crazy that the pandemic was the reason we finally had no school shootings for a year,\u201d Kelly Walker, a seventh grade english and language arts teacher in Queens, told Yahoo Finance. At the same time, listening to the news about schools reopening even as the coronavirus continues to spread, Walker added: \u201cI've had thoughts of, \u2018Wow, am I going to die because I'm a teacher?\u2019\u201dMiddle school teacher Brittany Myers, (C) stands in protest in front of the Hillsborough County Schools District Office on July 16, 2020 in Tampa, Florida.

So the number of people going into education has been declining, and there's a growing teacher shortage.\u201d\u2014Aarthi Swaminathan and Reggie Wade are reporters for Yahoo Finance.Aarthi can be reached at aarthi@yahoofinance.com and rwade@verizonmedia.com.
