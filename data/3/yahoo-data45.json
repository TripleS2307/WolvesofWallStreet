About 42% of public school students opted for fully remote learning, according to the latest Education Department (ED) data, and the other 58% opted for the blended instruction.Students return for their first day of in-class schooling following the pandemic at New York City's Preschool of the Arts, having their temperatures checked before proceeding into the school, Tuesday, 15 September 2020.

But in-person and blended schooling, which was originally scheduled to start on September 10 and then delayed until September 21, will now be staggered and begin on October 1 for middle and high school students.The demands placed on schools to staff these classes are heavy: Principals said they simply didn\u2019t have enough teachers or the resources to hire additional teachers for these three models of learning.\u201cIt was clear to me from the day they announced this whole system in June that there wouldn't be enough teachers to do what they were asking us to do,\u201d a Brooklyn-based principal, who asked not to be named to avoid professional retaliation, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cSo many of us principals have been saying for months that there are not enough teachers to run it the way that they're talking about running it. \u2026 we all knew that they couldn't deliver.\u201dStory continuesOn Tuesday night, New York City officials announced that parents who chose the \u201cblended\u201d option \u2014 meaning students would spend part of the week in school and the other part online with virtual classes \u2014 would not actually be guaranteed any virtual instruction when they\u2019re not in school given staffing issues.New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio in New York City, New York, U.S., June 23, 2020. (PHOTO: REUTERS/Caitlin Ochs)\u201cThe most upsetting part is the lack of transparency from the mayor and the chancellor,\u201d a Brooklyn-based high school English teacher, who asked not to be named, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cSince we initially went remote in March, I have found out about most of these important changes via Twitter, which is ridiculous. \u2026 I don't even take these updates seriously anymore because I know they'll likely be a new contradictory one a few days from now, so why bother?\u201dNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said that the city would hire 2,500 additional teachers. But in the race to hire, an underlying structural issue surfaced: There just aren\u2019t enough teachers around.\u201cWhat other industry would be allowed to operate this way and make decisions this way?\u201d Tucker said. \u201cIt just seems mind boggling. \u2026 I don't know how to hold anybody accountable. I don't understand, there's just no repercussions for this like completely backwards decision making.\u201dA New York City ED employee told Yahoo Finance that the city is actually looking to \u201credeploy\u201d ED staff who were previously teachers to help with the teacher shortage the city. According to the ED, the redeployment period would be temporary and end on Dec. 31, 2020 \u2014 unless both the ED and the United Federation of Teachers labor union agree to an extension.(Source: New York Department of Education)\u2018Lack of leadership\u2019 led to \u2018impossible situation\u2019On Thursday, more chaos ensued as parents across the city learned that they wouldn\u2019t be sending their children to school next week.The entire fiasco is \u201cdue to the lack of leadership,\u201d Daniel Friedrich\u202c, an associate professor at Columbia University\u2019s Teachers College and a parent of children in the New York City school system, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe shouldn't be in this business to begin with \u2014 there was a lack of action from the administration in general, to address the epidemic \u2026 [and on top of that] the chancellor and the mayor here in many ways failed to act throughout summer.\u201d\u202aRandi Weingarten, president of the American Teachers Federation, the second-largest teachers union in the country, stressed that the lack of mandates or federal guidance and lack of funding for school complicated the situation once the fall came around.\u201cI'm sorry that I sound so angry about all of this stuff, but all of this was foreseeable to anyone who is a schools person,\u201d Weingarten told Yahoo Finance\u2019s First Trade (video above). \u201cThis is part of the reason why we started fighting for how to reopen schools and the resources back in April.\u201dCases are up significantly in Wyoming, Wisconsin, Connecticut, and Puerto Rico. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)Weingarten asserted that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos could have \u201ccreated all sorts of other mandates or guidance for planning and for resources,\u201d but simply didn\u2019t.\u201cLook what is happening in terms of resources in schools, and you tell me that kids are priorities,\u201d Weingarten said. \u201cThey're not priorities to this administration. And I'm sorry I'm angry about it, but how can we rush to help a cruise industry, bars and restaurants, which I think are really important, but not rush to get the resources for kids? Why is it that ventilation and soap, which should have been important forever, are now only important? \u2026 they are trying to actually undermine public education.\u201dNew York City\u2019s experience is being closely watched since it\u2019s not only the biggest school district in the country, but also one of the few to resume in-person instruction amid the pandemic. Los Angeles County, the second biggest district, opted for remote learning until November but is making exceptions for small classes for some children with special needs,Virtual learning is also the primary option for students across Chicago, Miami, Houston, and others, according to a tracker compiled by Education Week. DeVos continues to push for in-person schooling. During a recent press conference on Monday at a school in Grand Rapids, Mich., she called the lack of in-person learning a \u201creal tragedy\u201d for children.U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos attends a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic response event about reopening schools hosted by U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House in Washington, U.S., August 12, 2020.

You don\u2019t want to go to work,\u2019\u201d a second grade teacher in Brooklyn, who asked not to be named to avoid retaliation, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe did more \u2014 we went above and beyond because we care and love our students and we don\u2019t get the support that we should get financially.\u201dThe city\u2019s leadership is \u201cnot in tune with what\u2019s happening in schools,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd they\u2019re not in tune with what the rest of the city looks like.\u201dA teacher conducts a lesson with students during an outdoor learning demonstration for New York City schools in front of the Patrick F.

They\u2019re heroes. And they\u2019re underpaid and overworked, and they face tremendous challenges and none more than during the pandemic.\u201dFriedrich, the Columbia University Teachers College professor and parent, stressed that society has to make sure to not put too much pressure on the people instructing children.\u201cTeachers are not priests,\u201d he said. \u201cThey're not there to save the world and sacrifice themselves, right? This is not a religious colony. Teaching is a job and you shouldn't have to give up your life for, or your job.\u201d\u2014Aarthi Swaminathan and Reggie Wade are reporters for Yahoo Finance.
