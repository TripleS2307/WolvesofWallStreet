And while it has contributed to record unemployment levels, the stock market largely has been riding high after its March dip, buoyed by tech companies.Women appear to be another key aspect of an uneven demographic impact, according to the nationally representative weighted survey of 200 Americans with some financial assets or investments.Women surveyed were far less confident in hitting their investment goals, with just 4% \"very confident\" compared to 32% of men. The survey found 47% of women are at least \"fairly confident,\" compared to 60% of men. Women had less aggressive investing styles, with 67% having individual equity investments, compared to 92% of men. (Many studies have similarly found women to be more risk-averse when it comes to investing than men.)Women surveyed were far less confident in hitting their investment goals, with just 4% \"very confident\" compared to 32% of men, a survey by Yahoo Finance-Harris Poll found.

A greater percentage of women are losing their jobs through layoffs or furloughs than men,\u201d said Will Johnson, the Harris Poll\u2019s CEO. \u201cOne key reason is that women disproportionately work in sectors that were shut down by the pandemic, such as retail, hospitality and education.\u201dThere was also a noted breakdown in bullish sentiment. Twice the percentage of men feel bullish than women (41% to 21%), saying it's a good time to increase investment in the stock market. This may have rubbed off in other areas. Men say they are much more likely to make a large purchase in the next three months due to current interest rates, Harris noted.Story continues--Ethan Wolff-Mann is a writer at Yahoo Finance focusing on consumer issues, personal finance, retail, airlines, and more.
