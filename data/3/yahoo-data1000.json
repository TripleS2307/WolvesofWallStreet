And while the market is certain to have ups and downs, like the subsequent rout on Thursday, industry analysts still believe the iPhone maker has more than enough room to continue growing.Wedbush analyst Dan Ives has pointed to Apple\u2019s market capitalization hitting $2 trillion, and BofA Securities\u2019 Wamsi Mohan upgraded the stock\u2019s price target from $340 to $390 a day after Apple hit its new peak.Apple CEO Tim Cook arrives to the global premiere for Apple's \"The Morning Show\" at the Lincoln Center in the Manhattan borough of New York City, U.S., October 28, 2019. REUTERS/Eduardo MunozSo what\u2019s driving Apple\u2019s market performance? Well, its hundreds of millions of active users, wildly popular accessories, and its plethora of services are easily the biggest draws. However, the company could still face trouble as a result of trade disputes. And its Apple TV+ service still hasn\u2019t taken off the way it was expected to.The case for Apple\u2019s continued growthJust a few months ago, Apple was facing major obstacles in the form of supply-chain interruptions and store closures caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The company eventually pulled its Q2 guidance and hasn\u2019t issued guidance for Q3.But Apple still managed growth in Q2 on the strength of its services and accessories business, despite a 7.2% year-over-year drop in iPhone revenue.Apple, however, has a potentially massive revenue generator in its upcoming iPhone, which is expected to be called the iPhone 12. The phone, which could be delayed until October due to the coronavirus\u2019 impact on the company\u2019s supply chain, is all but certain to be Apple\u2019s first 5G-capable device.According to Ives, the phone should be a sales monster for Apple, launching a so-called \u201csuper cycle\u201d with consumers rushing to get Apple\u2019s first device sporting next-generation connectivity.Apple team members demo the new cameras on iPhone 11 Pro for guests during an event to announce new products Tuesday, Sept. 10, 2019, in Cupertino, Calif. (AP Photo/Tony Avelar)\u201cWith 350 million of roughly 950 million iPhones worldwide currently in a window of an upgrade opportunity, Cupertino is roaring its engines ready to capitalize on this dynamic coupled by an AirPods franchise slated to sell 85 million this year (vs. 65 million last year),\u201d Ives wrote in a May research note.Story continuesMohan, meanwhile, points to Apple\u2019s wearables lineup, in addition to the 5G iPhone, as a key reason for the stock\u2019s continued growth.Moving forward, Mohan sees the company\u2019s transition to a continuous revenue model as a reason for its potential.Apple\u2019s services business, which consists of the App Store, Apple Music, AppleCar, and iCloud, is a major engine for the company, earning $13.3 billion in Q2. But Apple TV+, the firm\u2019s answer to Netflix (NFLX), isn\u2019t quite as popular as competing offerings.Potential blind spotsAccording to Bloomberg, as of May, the TV+ service, which launched in November 2019, had 10 million subscribers, with just 5 million active on the platform. Compare that to Disney+, which also launched in November and already had 50 million users as of April.It\u2019s worth noting that Disney+ is more expensive than Apple TV+, $7.99 per month versus $4.99 per month. Disney, however, has access to its incredible backlog of movies and TV shows, as well as 20th Century Fox\u2019s shows and movies.It\u2019s clear that Apple needs to make moves to accelerate Apple TV+ growth, and according to Ives, that could involve the company scooping up a Hollywood studio. Bloomberg also reports that the tech giant is looking into deals for older shows and movies, something Apple was hesitant to do out of a desire to rely solely on its own original content.Then there are potential trade disputes that Apple has to worry about. With tensions between the U.S. and China continuing to ratchet up as a result of China\u2019s clampdown on Hong Kong and the ongoing back and forth between the two countries on the origins of the coronavirus, there are fears that a new trade dispute could break out.The U.S.\u2019s decision to restrict American companies from working with China\u2019s Huawei could also come back to haunt Apple if Chinese consumers decide to boycott Apple\u2019s goods in retaliation. What\u2019s more, if China decided to hit directly at Apple by placing it on some kind of trade blacklist, it would be difficult for the company to quickly move its manufacturing operations to a new location.For now, however, Apple is seemingly riding out both the virus and transnational strife with relative ease.Got a tip?
