The doctors factored in whether the activity is inside or outside, proximity to others, length of potential exposure, likelihood of compliance, and personal risk level.Bars and large music concerts are the riskiest settings right now. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)The experts gave a score to each activity, with 1 being the least risky and 10 being the riskiest, and MLive averaged their scores to come up with a ranking.Bars, large music concerts, and packed sports stadiums are the riskiest places, according to experts, because of large groups of people congregating together with little room to keep at least six feet apart.Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, former special advisor for health policy under the Obama administration, previously stated that he doesn\u2019t see larger gatherings \u2013 like concerts, conferences, and sporting events \u2014 returning until \u201cfall 2021 at the earliest.\u201dThe Cameron Crazies taunt Leaky Black #1 of the North Carolina Tar Heels during the second half of their game against the Duke Blue Devils at Cameron Indoor Stadium on March 07, 2020 in Durham, North Carolina.

Major League Soccer (MLS) was the first to announce an official resumption of play, beginning on July 8, likely with no fans in attendance. The return of certain sports may be complicated if confirmed coronavirus cases continue to rise across the U.S.\u2018Not going to be a one-size-fits-all type of answer\u2019Gyms, amusement parks, churches, and food buffets all have a score of 8, making them very risky.Dr. Robyn Gershon, part of NYU School of Public Health, recently told Yahoo Finance\u2019s The Ticker that states currently experiencing spikes in coronavirus cases are places that did early reopening of high risk spots, like gyms, \u201cplaces where people can congregate and be in very close spaces.\u201dStory continuesFabian Arias (not pictured), a Lutheran pastor with Saint Peter's Church in Manhattan, holds a service on the street in Brooklyn, for a group of immigrants from Guatemala on May 30, 2020 in New York City.

However, public health experts agree that churches are very risky because of how close people are seated to each other.A church in Arkansas experienced an outbreak of coronavirus back in March, when at least 92 people tested positive and three people died. Many other outbreaks have taken place at churches across the country.\u201cThis is something that\u2019s not going to be a one-size-fits-all type of answer,\u201d Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security Dr. Amesh Adalja said on Yahoo Finance\u2019s On the Move. \u201cIt\u2019s really going to depend on the local dynamics and transmission of this virus, what\u2019s going on in that area, what the hospitals look like, and what\u2019s your personal risk tolerance and your risk factors for severe disease.\u201dThere are over 2 million coronavirus cases in the U.S. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)Schools have \u2018a system-level impact\u2019Pick-up basketball games, public pools, and schools are next on the list of risky activities. Schools, in particular, pose a significant challenge as the U.S. heads into the fall, when classes normally resume.Some schools are planning on shifting to an online format, while others are planning shortened semesters in anticipation of a second wave.Dr. Baicker described schools as \u201ca great example of something that has a system-level impact.\u201d This is because it\u2019s not only children and teachers factored into decision making but also to parents, siblings, and anyone else who might live with the children.Educator Scott Slivken works on his lesson plan as prepares to hold virtual office hours with his sixth grade students at the KIPP DC's Northeast Academy from his apartment on April 7, 2020 in Washington, DC.

(Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)Playgrounds, meanwhile, are a risk because children are likely to touch their hands and not maintain social distancing, along with the fact that it\u2019s harder to constantly keep playgrounds clean.As for indoor dining at restaurants, the shared ventilation poses a risk for patrons, along with the fact that patrons aren\u2019t wearing masks since they\u2019re eating.Hair salons/barber shops, pontoon boat rides, and movie theaters also received an average score of 6.All of the activities in this range pose social distancing challenges for participants.Beautician Bella Baba applies highlights to a woman's hair as she wears a protective face mask as phase two reopening continues during the outbreak of the coronavirus at Joseph Hair Salon in Port Washington, N.Y. REUTERS/Shannon StapletonDinner parties at a friend\u2019s house and backyard barbecues, can be risky if people aren\u2019t careful, received a 5 from MLive\u2019s analysis. Experts note that the key for participants is to stay at least six feet apart from people who aren\u2019t part of your household and avoid sharing food with each other.Malls and bowling alleys (both with a score of 5) are both contained places where the virus can spread if it gets crowded and proper sanitization measures aren\u2019t in place. Beaches, although they share the same score as malls and bowling alleys, can be lower risk as long as they aren\u2019t crowded.Airplanes also had an average risk score of 5. The most important thing, according to the experts MLive spoke with, is that passengers wear their masks properly. The rest is up to the airlines themselves \u2014 this includes leaving the middle seat empty, properly cleaning the plane after each flight, and making sure the air is filtered correctly.Passengers board an American Airlines flight to Charlotte, North Carolina at San Diego International Airport on May 20, 2020 in San Diego, California.

The best thing to do is to wear a mask when necessary and continue keeping your distance from others.Grocery shopping and camping are lower down on the list. As long as everyone in a supermarket is wearing masks, the risk of transmission is low. As for camping, it\u2019s lower risk as long as it\u2019s not a big group of people.Hotels, libraries and museums, and golfing each had an average score of 3. These are places where it\u2019s easy for people to keep their distance from each other.People wearing protective face masks walk at path at Domino Park in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn on May 31, 2020 in New York City.

As long as you don\u2019t come into contact with many people, it\u2019s not likely you\u2019ll be exposed, as long as you\u2019re wearing a mask.The safest activities according to MLive\u2019s experts? Getting takeout from a restaurant and playing tennis \u2014 which is one of the safest, lowest risk sports at this time.\u201cTakeout or curbside pickup \u2014 lots of businesses are thinking about creative ways to continue to provide goods and services to the public and employment opportunities for their workers, while keeping everyone safe,\u201d Baicker said. \u201cAnd I think understanding how people move through businesses not only tells us what\u2019s high risk but tells us how to make other things lower risk.Check out MLive\u2019s analysis ->Adriana is a reporter and editor covering politics and health care policy for Yahoo Finance.
