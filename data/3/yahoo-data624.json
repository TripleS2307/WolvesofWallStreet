Starting at $1,799, with the option to price it up to a bank account-draining $8,799, it\u2019s designed for both everyday users in need of a big-screen desktop that will last and professionals seeking a powerlifter of a computer without having to step up to either the outrageous iMac Pro or Mac Pro.I\u2019ve been using a decked-out version of Apple\u2019s (AAPL) iMac 27-inch as my work computer for the better part of a month, and it\u2019s proven capable of handling everything I\u2019ve thrown at it. From games to photo editing, it\u2019s never so much as broken a sweat.It doesn\u2019t hurt that it packs a gorgeous 5K display and an enhanced webcam that\u2019s perfect for our new dystopian work-from-home world.It\u2019s one heck of a desktop that\u2019s worth the investment, as long as you can afford the price of entry.Pros:Beautiful 27-inch Retina displayHigh-powered performanceClassic designCons:High starting priceMouse and keyboard may not suit everyoneBig-screen improvementsThe iMac 27-inch uses the same design as the current iMac 21.5-inch, featuring an incredibly thin body and stand that almost makes the display look like it\u2019s floating over your desk. It\u2019s an understated look that instantly makes your desk look classier.All of the cables plug into the back of the system and are routed through a gap in the stand to hide them. That\u2019s also why Apple includes its Magic Mouse and Magic Keyboard in the box. I\u2019m used to typing on my MacBook all day, so I wasn\u2019t bothered by the fact that this keyboard wasn\u2019t elevated.There\u2019s also still the issue of the USB C charging port for the mouse being located on its underside, making it impossible to use while it\u2019s charging.But you\u2019re not buying this machine for the keyboard or mouse, which are still wonderful despite those quibbles. You\u2019re getting it for its massive 27-inch display and boatloads of power.The iMac 27-inch features the same design as the iMac 21.5-inch, but offers a 5K panel and far more performance. (Image: Apple)That display, with its 5K resolution, is perfect for users who want to retouch photos with exacting detail. And because it uses Apple\u2019s nano-texture glass, a $500 add-on, it offers the benefits of a matte display \u2014 reducing glare in well-lit environments without dulling or washing out the actual on-screen image.Story continuesIf you\u2019re getting this all-in-one for any kind of media work, the nano-texture glass can be a huge benefit and has reduced the glare from the overhead lights in my kitchen.In addition to its display, the 27-inch iMac now gets an improved 1080p FaceTime camera that captures crisp and colorful images. What\u2019s more, Apple says the iMac\u2019s included T2 chip works alongside the system\u2019s three-speaker array to provide enhanced audio quality while video chatting. The new camera is a welcome upgrade, especially with so many people working from home.Performance for daysBeyond its monster display, the other reason you\u2019re likely looking at the iMac 27-inch is because of its gobs of power. The base version of the desktop comes with a 10th-generation, 6-core Intel (INTC) Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, an AMD (AMD) Radeon Pro 5300 graphics chip and a 256GB solid-state drive. That\u2019s a solid system, for sure, but nowhere near the top of the line version.That absolute unit of a computer features a 10th-gen, 10-core Intel Core i9 processor, an absurd 128GB of RAM, an AMD Radeon Pro 5700 XT with 16GB of memory, and an 8TB SSD. You buy that version of the iMac 27-inch and NASA is going to call asking if you can run their next space launch.Apple's iMac 27-inch offers a slew of high-powered Intel processors and can pack a whopping 128GB of RAM. It's a beast. (Image: Apple)The review unit I\u2019ve been using isn\u2019t quite that powerful, but I\u2019m sure it could at least operate some kind of super villain-style laser weapon, or the like. It features a 10th-gen, 10-core Intel Core i9 processor, 32GB of RAM, an AMD Radeon Pro 5700 XT with 16GB of memory, and a 1TB SSD for $4,499.The iMac handled everything I threw at it. The system knocked the teeth out of the popular Geekbench 5 CPU benchmarking test, with a score of 1220 for single-core and 9678 for multi-core. It\u2019s hard to quantify benchmarks, though, because they don\u2019t really give you an understanding of what that power means in terms of real-world performance.To do that, I played a few games including \u201cTomb Raider,\u201d which the iMac was able to run at 60 frames per second with the settings turned up to ultimate. That\u2019s an older game, which means the system requirements aren\u2019t as high as a newer title \u2014 but it still shows how powerful this iMac is.Should you get it?Oh boy, if I had the money, and Macs ran more games, I\u2019d drop my cash on this monster in a heartbeat. It\u2019s got a fantastic display, wonderful design, and power to spare. For everyone else, the iMac 27-inch will certainly meet their needs and is worth the cash.For professionals looking to get a system that they can use for video and photo editing, this is a fantastic solution.Got a tip?
