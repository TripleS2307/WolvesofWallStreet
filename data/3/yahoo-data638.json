He works for the American people. He answers to us, we don\u2019t answer to him.\u201dThe media\u2019s role is to \u201ckeep the bosses informed,\u201d Allen explained. \u201cThe American people, we are the boss, we run it,\u201d he said. \u201cThank God we have the media or else I think we might all be drinking Lysol right now, and we don\u2019t need to be drinking Lysol.\u201dAllen is the founder and CEO of the Allen Media Group which owns nearly a dozen cable networks, including the Weather Channel, about a dozen local TV stations, and produces more than 60 syndicated TV shows and thousands of hours of content.Allen is a champion of the media. His $8.5 billion all-cash bid for TV station owner Tegna, (TGNA) became public in March, and he plans to invest $10 billion over the next three years to acquire additional NBC, CBS, ABC, and FOX network affiliate local television stations and other media assets.Even though advertisers have cut back because of the financial toll of the pandemic, Allen is still bullish on the profitability of the television business. \u201cWe know, long run, it\u2019s a marathon, not a sprint. We\u2019re going to be fine. Everybody is going to need local news, weather, and sports. That\u2019s just essential to who we are,\u201d he said.Byron Allen (AP)\u2018The lens of white owners\u2019While Allen points out that the media has a vital role in informing the public about the coronavirus pandemic, he is critical of its coverage of racism and the protests following the death of George Floyd.\u201cI think [the media has] a big blind spot and I think that\u2019s because at the end of the day, 99.9% of the media is going through the lens of white owners and white managers,\u201d he said.Story continuesMoved by the racial justice protests, Allen wrote an op-ed titled \u201cBlack America speaks. America should listen.\u201d He said he offered it to several newspapers, but they refused to publish it.Undeterred, Allen spent $1 million to get it in major newspapers including the New York Times and Washington Post nonetheless. \u201cI knew that [newspapers] would reject it. And that\u2019s why I bought 16 pages because it was two pages, to print it out, 16 pages in 8 different newspapers around the country,\u201d he said.In his op-ed, Allen offered ideas to address economic, health care, and employment racial disparities. \u201cTribalism\u201d only hurts America, Allen said.\u201cWe have to position each and every American to succeed to his [or her] fullest because we have to compete as one nation as one tribe, the American tribe,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause we have a lot of emerging nations around the world who are doing a much better job of educating their citizens and getting their citizens engaged.\u201dMore from Sibile:Ben Carson on second coronavirus economic shutdown: \u2018You do that again, and you completely destroy the financial infrastructure\u2019Ben Carson: All Obama HUD rule does is provide \u2018permanent employment for lawyers\u2019Why Black patients receive worse care at the hospitalCost of Confederate symbols comes out of Black workers\u2019 paychecks: EPIThe upside of Trump\u2019s Fourth of July fireworksFind live stock market quotes and the latest business and finance news"}]}
