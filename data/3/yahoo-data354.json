Pressure on employees appeared to be the root cause of the issue, leading to fines from several regulators and a Federal Reserve-imposed asset cap that broadly restricts the company from growing any further.The company, the third-largest in the United States, launched efforts to \u201cre-establish\u201d its brand and launched efforts to overhaul the employee incentive structure that had previously pushed fraudulent cross-selling.Mack told Yahoo Finance that the company has made strides in changing its internal culture to clarify employee expectations and improve the incentive structure.\u201cAnd that has translated through to the customer experience,\u201d Mack said.Challenges aheadBut the company may face further challenges as the COVID-19 crisis imposes heavy financial strains on banks like Wells Fargo. Lenders have had to dramatically increase their provisions to absorb loan losses and consumers and businesses struggle to make loan payments.Mack said the company has revised down its expectations for how the U.S. economy may look in the third quarter of this year, given the difficulty in some parts of the country to contain the virus.\u201cIt\u2019ll be a better quarter but probably not as much of a recovery as we might have expected even just a few weeks ago,\u201d Mack said, although she expressed some optimism over trends in credit card and debit card spend.Story continuesWells Fargo reported earnings last week, which showed a net loss in the second quarter. The San Francisco-based bank slashed its dividend to preserve capital. Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf also said he was planning on cutting about $10 billion in expenses to improve its bottom line, which could include layoffs.Mack did not provide more details on where it might make those cuts, but she committed the company to offering \u201ctransparency and visibility\u201d as it addresses expenses.\u201cWe\u2019ll involve employees and customer feedback in the programs that we establish and the changes that we make,\u201d Mack said.Brian Cheung is a reporter covering the Fed, economics, and banking for Yahoo Finance.
