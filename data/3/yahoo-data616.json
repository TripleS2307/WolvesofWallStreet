If Ant\u2019s target numbers hold, it would become the new largest IPO in history.That\u2019s fitting of the world\u2019s most valuable private tech unicorn, last valued at $150 billion in 2018 after a record $14 billon funding round. Now it\u2019s targeting a public valuation of $225 billion.So, what exactly does Ant do, and how did it become so valuable?HANGZHOU, CHINA - JULY 21, 2020 - Ant Financial logo photographed at the hangzhou headquarters of Ant Group, the parent company of Alipay. Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China, July 21, 2020. - PHOTOGRAPH BY Costfoto / Barcroft Studios / Future Publishing (Photo credit should read Costfoto/Barcroft Media via Getty Images)Before Alibaba\u2019s $25 billion IPO in 2014 (the world\u2019s largest until Saudi Aramco), Alibaba CEO Jack Ma spun out its payments division under the name Zhejiang Ant Small & Micro Financial Services Group, later just Ant Financial Services Group. The obvious aim was to eventually bring Ant public on its own. Four years later, Alibaba took a 33% stake in Ant. Ant Group\u2019s CEO is Alibaba alum Simon Hu, but Jack Ma is Ant\u2019s largest shareholder. (In its IPO filing, Ant Group says its \u201corigin and continued affiliation with Alibaba is a source of strength as well as purpose.\u201d)Ant\u2019s core product is Alipay, the most popular digital payments app in China. It boasts a more than 50% share of China\u2019s massive mobile payments market, the largest in the world. Experts don\u2019t see the mobile payment revolution slowing any time soon, and Alipay is the global king in mobile payments. It also sells tech services to other Chinese financial and e-commerce businesses.Alipay launched in 2004 and hit 1.2 billion users last year. Almost all of its growth has come in Asia, though Alipay has signed a slew of U.S. partnerships with chains like Walgreens (WBA) and Neiman Marcus to let Alipay customers from China pay with Alipay when shopping in America. Last year, Alipay also opened up its app to American tourists in China \u2014 that was before the COVID-19 pandemic put a prolonged halt to global tourism.Story continuesAlipay users conduct more than 100 million mobile transactions on Alipay every day. The app\u2019s biggest competitor in China is WeChat Pay, from Alibaba rival Tencent (TCEHY).And then there\u2019s Yu\u2019ebao, China\u2019s largest money-market fund, with $170 billion in assets. Ant Group owns that, too. Ant sees itself as far more than a payments firm: its stated mission is \u201cto make it easy to do business anywhere.\u201dAnt\u2019s public offering will stand apart from the new unicorn IPO parade about to happen in America: Airbnb, DoorDash, Snowflake, and Palantir (via directing listing) are all aiming to go public by the end of this year \u2014 but none are profitable yet.Ant Group, in contrast, is wildly profitable. In its IPO filing, it reveals $3.2 billion of profit in the first half of 2020 ($10.5 billion in revenue), reflecting year-over-year growth of 1,000%. And that eye-popping profit came during a global pandemic.\u2014Daniel Roberts is an editor-at-large at Yahoo Finance and closely covers tech.
