The bank\u2019s quarterly investment banking revenue hit a record, and trading revenue more than doubled over last year as both fixed-income and equity trading picked up in the wake of the market run-up since March.Still, as with other banks including JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs stashed away an increasing sum in loan-loss provisions during the quarter to brace for potential customer defaults due to the pandemic.

Shares of Moderna surged as much as 22.5% as of 4:00 a.m. ET Wednesday, adding to a year to date advance of more than 280% through market close a day earlier.Story continuesThe development, manufacturing and distribution of a vaccine against the coronavirus has been viewed by many as the critical component to bringing daily life back meaningfully to a semblance of normalcy.

The result was an unexpected decline versus the build of 250,000 barrels expected, according to Bloomberg data.

High earnings expectations are becoming embedded in share prices while there is a tighter correlation amongst the stocks.\u201d\u20149:31 a.m. ET: Stocks open higher, Dow adds 350+ pointsHere were the main moves in markets as of 9:31 a.m. ET:S&P 500 (^GSPC): +34.14 points (+1.07%) to 3,231.66Dow (^DJI): +372.3 points (+1.4%) to 27,014.89Nasdaq (^IXIC): +77.16 points (+0.74%) to 10,565.74Crude (CL=F): +$0.08 (+0.2%) to $40.37 a barrelGold (GC=F): -$5.90 (-0.33%) to $1,807.50 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): -2.5 bps to yield 0.6150%\u20149:15 a.m. ET: Industrial production jumps by most since 1959 with reopening under wayIndustrial production in the US rose in June by the greatest month over month margin in over six decades, with businesses and manufacturing coming back after coronavirus-induced shutdowns across the country.Industrial production \u2013 a gauge of output at factories, mines and utility companies \u2013 surged 5.4% in June over May, following May\u2019s 1.4% month on month increase, according to the Federal Reserve.
