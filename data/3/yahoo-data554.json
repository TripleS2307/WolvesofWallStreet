Its legal action is the first from a state attorney general, and follows a lawsuit filed by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. That move was supported by dozens of schools from Princeton to Purdue, and Massachusetts is also reportedly preparing a lawsuit.\u201cThis policy isn\u2019t just unlawful, it\u2019s dangerous and morally reprehensible,\u201d California AG Xavier Becerra said in a virtual press conference. \u201cWell, not on our watch.\u201dThe lawsuit states that the temporary final rule by DHS and ICE is \u201carbitrary and capricious, [and] in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.\u201dU.S. President Donald Trump refers to amounts of temperature change as he announces his decision that the United States will withdraw from the landmark Paris Climate Agreement, in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, U.S., June 1, 2017.

However, the school needs to certify their status to the government.Only 8% of colleges have thus far planned for a completely online fall semester \u2014 and 2.1% are \u201cwaiting to decide,\u201d according to data compiled by the Chronicle of Higher Education.U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House in Washington, U.S., June 26, 2020. (PHOTO: REUTERS/Carlos Barria)\u2018Cruel, senseless, and xenophobic\u2019The same day, almost 100 members of Congress signed a letter to the heads of ICE and DHS to oppose then move.\"We call out this policy for what it is: a cruel, senseless, and xenophobic attempt to use noncitizens as political pawns in order to financially coerce colleges and universities to reopen campuses this fall, despite what is best for public health,\" the lawmakers stated. \"This policy is dangerous to the health and well-being of numerous communities.\"According to a report by the Bipartisan Policy Center, the economic value of international students is worth roughly $20 billion per year in tuition and fees \u2014 a large source of educational revenue for institutions likely to be strapped in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis.The report noted that enrollment \u201cis already projected to decrease by 15% percent this year, leading to an estimated $23 billion decline in revenues, as more students defer enrollment or choose to attend less-expensive institutions closer to home,\u201d the report stated.\u2014Aarthi Swaminathan is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering education.
