That\u2019s despite the stock market essentially being on autopilot of late even as the COVID-19 pandemic rages on.The total current cash position for the group stood at an average 19% of one\u2019s portfolio, well above the levels seen among most portfolio managers on Wall Street. Cash levels clocked in at 12% of the average portfolio in Tiger 21\u2019s survey last quarter.The reason behind the cash raising is straightforward: Tiger 21 says the group is just wildly unsure how the medium-term will shake out in the fight against COVID-19 and the race for the presidency. Investors polled by Tiger 21 say they are selling public equity, private equity and collectible investments such as second homes to raise cash.Credit Getty\u201cOur members are concerned about the uncertainties coming. It\u2019s not just the election. It\u2019s how are we going to get back to a normal economy. The stock market is surging, but that only represents 15% to 20% of the labor force. Our best estimates are 80% of the labor force where all the pain is, not in the public companies. And we know on Main Street there are a lot of issues going on. So it\u2019s interest rates. It\u2019s the concern about all the money flooding in and how much of that money is actually distorting the markets and how long will that last,\u201d Tiger 21 founder and chairman Michael Sonnenfeldt told Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade.Sonnenfeldt points out one area where his group of investors are split right now is on the impact of Joe Biden becoming president. Theoretically, Biden\u2019s promise to raise taxes on people earning more than $400,000 a year could wallop the rich.Story continuesAdded Sonnenfeldt, \u201cSome of our members are concerned about paying taxes depending on how they think the money is being spent. Is it being spent wisely? Others believe that you can\u2019t have a functioning society without having roads and a military, and you have to pay your fair share.\u201dBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
