It enables states to provide an additional $300 in weekly benefit payments to unemployed workers.However, that amount is insufficient to offset the hit cash-strapped consumers are likely to face in August, Goldman\u2019s analysts wrote this week. The $70 billion drop in monthly personal income in August translates into a whopping $825 billion, or 4% of gross domestic product (GDP) on an annualized basis, the data found.The new payments are \u201ctoo little too late\u201d to boost August spending, Goldman wrote, and \u201cwill likely weigh on personal consumption and retail sales in August.\u201dWhile the new $300 weekly unemployment payments could cut jobless workers\u2019 monthly personal income losses in half, it\u2019s not likely that it'll reach Americans until September. Uncertainty surrounds the White House\u2019s program, and the subsequent delays states have undergone in implementing it are weighing heavily on the outlook.In order to bypass Congress\u2019 power of the purse, the president directed that the federal government\u2019s disaster relief fund be used to pay for the disbursements. Roughly $40 billion from that fund has been set aside to help states provide $300 in weekly unemployment benefits to Americans, for about three to five weeks.Thirty states have been approved to participate in the federal \u201clost wages assistance\u201d program which was established as a result of President Trump\u2019s executive order -- but to date, only a few actually have.Remaining states are also expected to join the program because it does not require them to share new costs with the federal government.Americans have been subject to a $15 billion drop in unemployment payments every week since the $600 in federal benefits payments expired. Jobless Americans began cutting back on spending when the $600 in federal benefits expired on July 31.Story continuesAccording to Cardify, a mobile app that tracks consumer spending, there has been a greater pullback in apparel and accessories purchases than there was for grocery and wholesale store spending.More from Sibile:Democratic Rep. blasts Trump on USPS woes: \u2018No hope\u2019 of waking up knowing who won the electionTrump payroll tax deferment is \u2018employee relations disaster\u2019Coronavirus gut check: How small businesses are survivingHow Hollywood content can \u2018normalize injustice\u2019Michigan Gov.
