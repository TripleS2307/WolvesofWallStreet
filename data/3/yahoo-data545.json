It will be within a matter of weeks from November. It\u2019s ready to go and it\u2019s ready to \u2014 for massive distribution to everybody \u2014 with a focus, again, on seniors.\u201dMost experts, and the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), believe earlier that it would likely take until at least the summer of 2021 until widespread vaccination is available to be distributed to the American public.

REUTERS/Carlos BarriaDr. Ezekiel Emanuel, vice provost of Global Initiatives at the University of Pennsylvania and former White House policy advisor under the Obama administration, said that the president\u2019s claims seem to be wishful thinking from someone who is fighting to be re-elected.President Trump \u201cmay know something the rest of us don't,\u201d Emanuel told Yahoo Finance\u2019s The Ticker (video above). \u201cWe've already seen that that can be the case. But whether we get a vaccine really depends upon nature, not upon his rhetoric. It depends upon how many people who are in the trials are exposed, how many people convert, how protective the vaccine actually is. And that's determined by the environment, not by his rhetoric.\u201d\u2018We\u2019re getting a very bad return\u2019The typical vaccine timeline can take more than 10 years to develop. With Operation Warp Speed, health experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), have estimated a vaccine could be accessible to the public within 12-18 months of the onset of the pandemic (which was March 2020).Story continuesThe most promising vaccine candidates so far are being developed by Moderna (MRNA) and AstraZeneca (AZN), which are both in phase three of their trials. Other pharmaceutical companies Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Novavax (NVAX) are in phase two.Robyn Porteous is injected with a vaccine as part of the country's human clinical trial for potential vaccines after being tested for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), at the Wits RHI Shandukani Research Centre in Johannesburg, South Africa, August 27, 2020. REUTERS/Siphiwe SibekoIt is unclear if any of the vaccines will be fully effective even if they pass all the necessary trials. And scientists are unsure of the long-term effects of any vaccines that are granted emergency use authorization (EUA) by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA).\u201cI don't think it's the rushing through stages\u201d that\u2019s the issue, Emanuel said. \u201cI mean, we are going faster than normal. The size of the studies are smaller than normal. You know, 30,000 people in a randomized controlled trial, with 15,000 people getting the COVID vaccine is way smaller than any other previous vaccine trial. On the other hand, we have a pandemic. It has had trillions of dollars of impact on the U.S., not to mention the whole world.\u201dEmanuel added that the U.S. response to this pandemic has been going \u201cbadly,\u201d particularly compared to other countries around the world. President Trump has prioritized the U.S. economic recovery over social distancing and other recommended guidelines for containing the spread of the virus by pressuring states to reopen their economies, deciding against implementing a face mask mandate, and reportedly downplaying the dangers of the virus early on.\u201cWe're not in the top 10,\u201d he said. \u201cWe're not the worst, but we're not in the top 10. And we're definitely, given how much we spend, we're getting a very bad return, and you can see that in the response to COVID.\u201dThere are over 6.6 million cases in the U.S. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)\u2018There\u2019s a lot of work to be done\u2019Part of the problem is the public\u2019s distrust of many of the nation\u2019s health agencies due to the political pressure they are facing from the Trump administration.\u201cI do think it's extremely important that any data that's submitted to the FDA, even if they're only going for an emergency use authorization, be viewed at and critically assessed by one of these advisory committees,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cWe gotta stop having Steve Hahn, the commissioner, make a decision on emergency use authorization all on his own. We need to see the data. We need an external advisory committee that actually is not beholden to President Trump actually evaluate the data, and only then make a decision, and that's not going to be rushed through.\u201dA recent poll found that only one in 10 Americans trust the FDA and the pharmaceutical industry with regards to safety and effectiveness.\u201cThat is a very bad place to be,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cAnd it also means that a new administration is going to have to spend some time rebuilding that kind of trust, doing things to increase transparency so people have the data, increase the prominence probably of the advisory committees that rule on drug approvals. So I think there's a lot of work to be done.\u201dBillionaire philanthropist Bill Gates holds up a vaccine during a news conference at the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI) conference in London June 13, 2011. REUTERS/Paul HackettAn added issue was highlight by a new report from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation that indicated that years of progress made on vaccine coverage, or estimated percentage of people who have received specific vaccines, has been erased by the coronavirus pandemic.\u201cConsider vaccine coverage, which is a good proxy measure for how health systems are functioning,\u201d the report stated. \u201cOur data partner, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), found that in 2020, coverage is dropping to levels last seen in the 1990s. In other words, we\u2019ve been set back about 25 years in about 25 weeks.\u201dThese findings, according to Emanuel, show why a vaccine is \u201cvery urgently needed.\u201d\u201cI think skipping some of the stages is not the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem is do the data confirm effectiveness? Do we have a system in place to really assess safety over time, especially severe safety events? And that's, I think, where the public is really wary.\u201dAdriana is a reporter and editor covering politics and health care policy for Yahoo Finance.
