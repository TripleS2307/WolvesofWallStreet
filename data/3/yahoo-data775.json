In the U.S. nearly 2.2. million cases have been reported, and more than 118,000 are dead. On Friday, the Sunshine State reported a rise in COVID-19 cases of 4.4%, sharply higher than the previous 7-day average of 3.2%.The relentless climb in domestic cases prompted California\u2019s governor to require mask-wearing in public, while Texas and Arizona recently began to ok enforcing masks in public, amid a spike in new diagnoses in those states.Meanwhile, the economy has sent mixed signals about the trajectory of a recovery, according to Morgan Stanley data, underscoring volatility in markets hopeful for a \u201cV-shaped\u201d rebound.\u201cWe note a continuous upward inflection in eating out in restaurants to 26% (from 17% two weeks ago), mainly driven by the South region and rural areas.

The mask controversy \u2014 which took center stage in a debate over President Donald Trump\u2019s weekend rally in Tulsa \u2014 is rooted in a perceived infringement on individual freedom, and disputed claims about face masks reducing the intake of oxygen.Yet public health experts point to the success in New York and New Jersey, two former epicenters that are now relaxing stay-at-home orders, in implementing such measures to control the outbreak.Public health experts expressed concerns with AMC\u2019s (AMC) plan to reopen theaters without enforcing masks Thursday.
