According to Johns Hopkins University data, the U.S. reported more than 30,000 new COVID-19 cases on Friday, which was the highest number of daily cases since May 1.After months of lockdown, states that reopened their economies earlier than others are beginning to see a resurgence in cases. \u201cAfter weeks of prolonged shutdowns to cautiously planning and implementing phased reopening plans, it is hoped our nation is on the \u2018right route.\u2019 However, over the last week or so, more than a dozen states reported significant upticks in cases and a select few experienced an increase in their positivity rate that was not a direct result of more testing,\u201d Raymond James Chief Investing Officer Larry Adam wrote in a note June 19.\u201cOur Healthcare Policy Analyst Chris Meekins believes this is a swell of the first wave rather than a second wave, and that the probability of the US truly turning a corner on the outbreak by July 4 remains at 65%,\u201d Adam added.U.S housing marketMeanwhile, the U.S. housing market will be in focus this week. Existing home sales are expected to have decline 5.6% in May to a seasonally adjusted 4.09 million units, up from a 17.8% plunge in April. The National Association of Realtors\u2019 existing home sales data is measured by contract closings as opposed to contract signings, which are measured by pending home sales, Nomura economist Lewis Alexander pointed out.\u201cGiven the sharp 21% m-o-m decline in pending home sales during April, we expect another decline in existing home sales in May. The expected pickup in buying activity due to easing of social distancing restrictions by many US states should be reflected in existing home sales reports in coming months,\u201d Alexander said in a note June 19.Furthermore, new home sales are expected to have bounced 1.9% in May to a seasonally adjusted 635,000 units, up from a modest 0.6% increase in April. \u201cEasing of restrictions on mobility and nonessential business activity suggests contract signings for newly built homes likely rose solidly during the month,\u201d Alexander said.Story continuesAlexander noted that the weekly volume in mortgage loan applications has been increasing substantially since bottoming in April. All should be positives for the housing market in the near term.HONG KONG, CHINA - 2020/05/11: Multinational sport clothing brands Adidas and Nike logos seen at a store in Hong Kong.
