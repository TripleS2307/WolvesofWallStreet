For many employers, the answer seems to be yes.\u201cA couple of us [at Mercer] were talking about what\u2019s the tipping point? At what point can an employer not go back?\u201d said Mary Ann Sardone, a partner at Mercer. \u201cThere is a permanence now that we\u2019re in the fall talking about this.\u201dBack in March when employers sent their (mostly white-collar) workers home, the feeling among many companies was that it would be temporary. But the pandemic\u2019s severity convinced companies and employees to invest in new protocols, home-office equipment, and try fresh ideas.Man doing telework and reconciling family life\u201cCompanies made return plans and have halted, changed, and pushed them out,\u201d said Sardone. \u201cNow there is a permanence that I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be able to unwind.\u201dIn Mercer\u2019s most recent employer survey of 819 respondents, 83% of employers indicated they would provide flexibility at a greater scale post-pandemic. One in three anticipate having 50% or more of the workforce remote post-Covid, compared to one in 30 pre-pandemic, a 900% change.The flexibility, companies said, was mostly about where the work is done; but also 72% reported expecting flexibility around hours and scheduling, and 49% reported flexibility around how work gets done, as companies have quickly adopted new technology (see: Zoom, Cisco Webex, telehealth) by necessity.Story continuesWhile a lot of the changes are designed to help parents, who have to juggle childcare duties, Sardone said flexibility is emerging for companies that need other shift times filled and are able to work with employees who may prefer non-standard hours as well.\u2018Too much opportunity\u2019 not to do thisThe increased flexibility, which appeals to what employees want, is by no means a favor to them. Employers are very enthusiastic too.Movers unload a truckload of belongings as the Lilly family move into their new home, Tuesday, July 21, 2020, in Washingtonville, N.Y.

(AP Photo/John Minchillo)That\u2019s because, Sardone says, flexibility presents \u201ctoo much opportunity\u201d for companies not to provide it.\u201cThe obvious kind of opportunity is expanding your talent pool,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere you might have been a high cost location, now you have the ability to tap into labor markets anywhere within reason.\u201dGetting labor is a huge benefit, but it\u2019s not the top reason employers are citing. According to the survey, 76% of companies cited higher engagement and productivity for supporting these policies.\u201cWhat I was most surprised at was how bullish employers are around flexibility,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was a pretty compelling stat.\u201dFor companies that have changed the back-to-office plans multiple times, providing flexibility to employees also gives companies agility and flexibility themselves. While companies can\u2019t really lower office costs too much (multi-year leases are tough to get out of if you\u2019re not at the end of them), companies can and have been investing in technology that makes where and when the work is done matter less.\u201cWhere you may have cost savings for infrastructure, you may need to have investment in tech to make remote working work,\u201d said Sardone.Fresh new challengesThe new normal, great for many companies and employers as it may be, isn\u2019t without its challenges.In Mercer\u2019s most recent employer survey, 83% of employers indicated they would provide flexibility at a greater scale post pandemic. (Getty Images)Sardone said big companies with significant investment in their headquarters or ones that provide generous perks, like free food, a gym, childcare \u2014 often campus-like tech firms \u2014 will have to think creatively about how to retain talent that especially values these aspects of company culture.But it\u2019s general culture in a remote environment that will be a hurdle companies have to adapt to. There\u2019s no general rule or guideline, Sardone said, because every workplace is so different. Each will have their own challenges in recreating their formulas digitally.\u201cMuch of culture is centered on face time and human interactions,\u201d she said. \u201cHow do you replace that?\u201dHowever, the key obstacle so far, Mercer has found, is managers.\u201cA lot of our clients are finding that is the biggest obstacle: the manager and their ability and capacity \u2014 it comes from having to lead and manage differently and it requires training,\u201d she said.Working primarily online requires a different set of skills and managers and employees alike need different levels and means of support. As the ways work gets done change, so do myriad adjacent parts of the machine, companies are finding.
