America\u2019s woes come as markets are being whipsawed between data suggesting the economy has stabilized, and a stream of data suggesting more people are falling prey to the virus.On Thursday, the Sunshine State \u2014 a domestic epicenter \u2014 reported its worst day yet in hospitalizations and deaths, while Arizona recorded its highest number of cases in nearly a week. Meanwhile, New York saw hospitalizations creep up for the third straight day, just as the state begins the next phase of its reopening.Meanwhile, average citizens are desperate for some semblance of normalcy \u2014 even as fears grow of a second COVID wave that could lead to renewed restrictions on public life.\u201cThe high-frequency data suggest renewed fears about the coronavirus are starting to weigh on consumption even in states that haven\u2019t moved to reimpose restrictions, reinforcing our view that the pace of the economic recovery will slow over the next few months,\u201d wrote Andrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics on Thursday.With a rollback of reopening plans occurring in coronavirus hotspots like Arizona, California, Florida and Texas, \u201cits therefore not a huge surprise that the recovery in economic activity in these states has started to tail off,\u201d Hunter said.\u201cBut the data also show a clear leveling off in the rest of the country too, despite other states not reimposing restrictions and some even continuing to loosen them,\u201d he added.Coronavirus cases are surging in southern U.S. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)Internationally, the news abroad wasn\u2019t much more encouraging. Hong Kong and Tokyo both set single day records for COVID-19 cases, while India \u2014 one of the largest international hotspots outside of Brazil \u2014 reported a jump of nearly 25,000 new diagnoses, bringing its five-day total to around 100,000.Story continuesWith the virus strengthening its hold on the global economy, attention has shifted toward methods of transmission and treatments to mitigate the spread.Amid widening criticism of its handling of the crisis, the World Health Organization on Thursday took a step closer to acknowledging the role of airborne spread, saying the virus can be transmitted via air during medical procedures that generate aerosols \u2014 added that spreading in other indoor settings was not entirely out of the question.That means \u201cshort-range\u201d transmission in certain indoor venues like cafes, restaurants, churches and gyms \u2014 especially when they are crowded and poorly ventilated \u2014 \u201ccannot be ruled out,\u201d the WHO said.The WHO, \u201ctogether with the scientific community, has been actively discussing and evaluating whether [COVID-19] may also spread through aerosols in the absence of aerosol generating procedures, particularly in indoor settings with poor ventilation,\u201d the agency said. Earlier this week, the organization acknowledged \"emerging evidence\" of airborne transmission.While several key theories have gained traction, the WHO added that \u201cthe proportion of exhaled droplet nuclei or of respiratory droplets that evaporate to generate aerosols, and the infectious dose of viable [coronavirus] required to cause infection in another person are not known, but it has been studied for other respiratory viruses.\u201dBig Pharma\u2019s date with CongressAnd amid escalating hopes of finding a viable vaccine, a Congressional committee will hold a hearing on July 21 with companies that are thick in the race for a cure. It will include testimony from officials at AstraZeneca (AZN), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Merck (MRK), Moderna (MRNA) and Pfizer (PFE), all of whom have leading vaccine candidates in play.\u201cThe industry is in an unprecedented race and working at the fastest speed ever even imagined to get to the point where we will understand the degree to which a vaccine can actually prevent a covid-19 virus infection,\u201d David Dodd, chairman and CEO of GeoVax, told Yahoo Finance on Thursday.\u201cSo we\u2019re racing to do that [and] it\u2019ll probably be early 2021, maybe a little bit later, before we know we have a vaccine that's safe and effective and durable,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are the 3 components that are absolutely critical.\u201dAccording to Department of Health and Human Services Secrteary Alex Azar, the world\u2019s largest economy may have tens of millions of experimental vaccine doses at its disposal by fall \u2014 and could scale up quickly to hundreds of millions by the turn of the year."}]}
