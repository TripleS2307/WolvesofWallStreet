Then the COVID-19 pandemic changed everything.In the beginning of 2020, Trump frequently touted the United States\u2019 economic strength \u2014 pointing to the unemployment rate below 4% and a stock market setting records. \u201cAmerica is now the hottest economy anywhere in the world,\u201d he said in January.Throughout his first term, Trump has taken full credit for the U.S. economy, ignoring the economic growth of the President Obama years.In 2017, with a Republican U.S. House of Representatives and Senate, Trump signed his signature tax cuts into law.\u201cI consider this very much a bill for the middle class and a bill for jobs,\u201d he said as he signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. \u201cJobs are produced through companies and corporations and you see that happening. Corporations are literally going wild over this.While in office, Trump has publicly clashed with CEOs and businesses whose policies he doesn\u2019t like. He\u2019s gone after Amazon, Twitter, GM and many others. Most recently, he called for the boycott of Ohio-based tire manufacturer Goodyear. He repeatedly attacked Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and pressured the Fed to cut interest rates.Trump declared himself \u201ca tariff man\u201d and used the tariffs as a negotiating tactic, often despite opposition from many within his own party and the business community. \u201cI love properly-put-on tariffs,\u201d he said earlier this month in Ohio.....I am a Tariff Man. When people or countries come in to raid the great wealth of our Nation, I want them to pay for the privilege of doing so. It will always be the best way to max out our economic power. We are right now taking in $billions in Tariffs. MAKE AMERICA RICH AGAIN\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2018Trump made good on a 2016 campaign promise to negotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. The newly branded United States Mexico Canada Agreement (or USMCA) earned the support of labor groups and Corporate America alike.Story continuesIn January, he also signed the Phase 1 trade deal with China, but only after a trade war that resulted in tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in goods that hurt U.S. businesses and farmers.FILE - In this Wednesday, Jan. 15, 2020, file photo, U.S. President Donald Trump, right, signs a trade agreement with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, in the East Room of the White House, in Washington. China\u2019s government welcomed an interim trade deal with Washington and said Thursday the two sides need to address each other\u2019s \u201ccore concerns.\u201d (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)Roughly seven months later, the United States\u2019 relationship with China is as rocky as ever. Trump frequently blasts the Chinese government over its handling of the coronavirus.\u201cI don't want to deal with them now. With what they did to this country and to the world, I don't want to talk to China right now,\u201d said Trump earlier this month.As the coronavirus continues to plague the United States, voters will judge Trump on his handling of the virus he downplayed for months. More than 170,000 Americans are dead, the unemployment rate is at 10.2% as millions remain out of work, and small businesses are going under as the wealthiest nation in the world continues to be battered by the virus.Boosted by trillions of dollars in stimulus, U.S. stocks have bounced back from their March lows. Trump insists his administration is handling the virus well, often using the stock market as a measure of success.The president is making the case that he is the only candidate who can bring the economy back, but Democrats argue the United States can\u2019t afford four more years of Donald Trump.Jessica Smith is a reporter for Yahoo Finance based in Washington, D.C.
