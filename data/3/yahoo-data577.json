Apple\u2019s historic run has been all the more impressive given the fact that it only passed the $1 trillion mark two years earlier in 2018, and reached $1.5 trillion just two months ago.Apple CEO Tim Cook arrives to the global premiere for Apple's \"The Morning Show\" at the Lincoln Center in the Manhattan borough of New York City, U.S., October 28, 2019. REUTERS/Eduardo MunozApple\u2019s new pricing reduces its overall impact on the price-weighted Dow, moving it down from the most influential spot when it was trading at about $500 to the middle of the pack. That makes UnitedHealth Group the new most influential stock on the Dow followed by Home Depot, and pushing Apple below the likes of Microsoft and McDonald\u2019s.But as Yahoo Finance\u2019s Brian Cheung explained in his recent edition of \u201cYahoo U,\u201d that doesn\u2019t mean anything for Apple\u2019s own market value. That\u2019s because while the price of a single share is lower, the split created more individual shares.Calculate the company\u2019s market cap based on the new price and number of shares, and you\u2019d get the same amount you\u2019d have gotten if the stock didn\u2019t split and shares stayed at their higher price.Analysts agree Apple\u2019s future is brightWedbush analyst Dan Ives points to even greater potential growth in Apple\u2019s future, specifically in the next 12 to 18 months. That growth, Ives said in a recent research note, will come from as many as 350 million of Apple\u2019s 950 million global iPhone users who are ready to upgrade to Apple\u2019s upcoming iPhone 12.That device, which is widely expected to be Apple\u2019s first 5G-capable smartphone, could play especially well in China, Ives said, with the region potentially making up as much as 20% of iPhone 12 sales.Story continuesAll of this depends on consumer sentiment during Apple\u2019s launch period. And with unemployment numbers still high, and stimulus talks in Congress stalled, it could be difficult for many consumers to justify spending hundreds of dollars on a new smartphone at this time.Still, Apple has spent much of its time in the past few years ensuring that it isn\u2019t as dependent on iPhone sales as it once was. To that end, the firm has dramatically increased revenue from its Services division, adding subscription options including Apple Music, Apple TV+, and Apple Arcade.In its most recent quarter, that business saw revenue of $13.12 billion compared to iPhone revenue of $26.4 billion. Revenue for Apple\u2019s other businesses, which include iPad, Mac, and Accessories range from $7 billion to $6.4 billion.With the new stock split, Apple could see a raft of new investors, hoping to get in just before it launches its next line of products in September.Got a tip?
