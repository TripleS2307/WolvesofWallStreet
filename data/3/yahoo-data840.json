Warner Bros. said in a press statement that the studio \u201cwill share a new 2020 release date imminently.\u201d But the move is a blow to movie theater chains, many of which had planned to begin cautious reopening in order to show \u201cTenet\u201d and \u201cMulan,\u201d Disney\u2019s next big live-action remake which has been pushed from March 27 to July 24 to Aug. 21, and now, given the Warner Bros. move, could certainly get pushed again. (Disney had no comment.)\u201cTenet\u201d and \u201cMulan\u201d were set to be the first two blockbusters post-lockdown, and theaters had hung their hopes on the films. Both movies had budgets of over $200 million.Disney (DIS) CEO Bob Chapek even said on an earnings call in May that Disney expected to \u201cget a pretty good idea\u201d of whether Americans were ready to go back to the movies \u201cbecause there's a competitive movie that opens one week before our film,\u201d a reference to \u201cTenet.\u201dBut then in June, Warner Bros., which is owned by AT&T (T) pushed \u201cTenet\u201d to July 31, leaving \u201cMulan\u201d up first. That salvo prompted an apparent game of chicken between the studios not to be the first to put out a big release amid the pandemic\u2014especially considering the optics of doing so at a time when COVID-19 cases are hitting a new peak in the U.S.Hollywood filmmaker Christopher Nolan spotted shooting his next film 'Tenet' near Taj Hotel, Colaba, on Sept. 17, 2019 in Mumbai, India.

On June 26, Disney delayed \u201cMulan\u201d to Aug. 21. Three days later, AMC pushed its planned reopening to July 30 to match the August release dates of \u201cTenet\u201d and \u201cMulan.\u201dStory continuesNow \u201cTenet\u201d won\u2019t come out in August, and if \u201cMulan\u201d gets pushed past August, AMC likely won\u2019t open on July 30. Disney\u2019s \u201cThe Personal History of David Copperfield,\u201d an indie from Searchlight (formerly Fox Searchlight before the Disney-Fox deal) starring Dev Patel in the title role, is currently set for an Aug. 14 theatrical release, but could plausibly end up going straight to Disney+.AMC can\u2019t weather lockdown much longer: the chain in July got an infusion of $300 million in debt financing from Silver Lake Partners to narrowly avoid bankruptcy\u2014for now.Indoor movie theaters will soon have to decide whether to re-open some locations in states with fewer cases of the virus\u2014before they have any new blockbusters to lure moviegoers. (Drive-in theaters across the country helped \u201cStar Wars: The Empire Strikes Back\u201d become the No. 1 movie at the box office last week.)Meanwhile, fans wonder whether Warner Bros. could just release \u201cTenet\u201d for digital streaming, skipping theaters altogether. Rich Greenfield, media analyst with LightShed Partners, suggests in a research note this week that WarnerMedia could put the movie on HBO Max as the \u201cbattering ram WarnerMedia needs vs. Amazon and Roku.\u201d But Christopher Nolan is unlikely to allow that. His movies are made to be seen on big screens, and \u201cTenet,\u201d like \u201cDunkirk,\u201d was shot in IMAX format.Instead, Variety reports that Warner Bros. may release \u201cTenet\u201d overseas before the U.S. Studio chief Toby Emmerich says the film will not be treated \u201clike a traditional global day-and-date release.\u201d Doing so would carry two risks: Nolan\u2019s film has been marketed with great secrecy, and releasing it in other markets first would likely result in a flood of spoilers online; it would also make the film a symbol of America\u2019s failure to contain the virus.\u2014Daniel Roberts is an editor-at-large at Yahoo Finance.
