The primary fault here lies in the POTUS and Congress for not handling the pandemic properly,\u201d Sara Goldrick-Rab, professor of sociology and medicine and founding director at the Hope Center for College, Community, and Justice at Temple University, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWith a real lockdown in spring, we wouldn\u2019t be here right now.\u201dFreshman students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill discuss their frustrations with housing on August 18, 2020 in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. (Photo: Melissa Sue Gerrits/Getty Images)The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill started classes for just a week before it made the decision to shut down on Monday after a \u201csignificant rise\u201d in COVID-19 infections among its students.\u201cWe all saw this coming,\u201d student newspaper The Daily Tar Heel\u2019s editorial board wrote in an opinion piece.Many colleges initially planned to open campuses for in-person classes, betting on the fact that the coronavirus wouldn\u2019t massively disrupt campus safety. But by the beginning of August, that number had dwindled considerably \u2014 though hundreds of schools pushed forward with campus re-openings.Goldrick-Rab stressed that students should not be blamed for any outbreaks.\u201cPeople are people \u2014 they congregate,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s the job of government and public health experts to structure the situation so they can\u2019t or aren\u2019t at risk when doing so.\"Story continuesAs of July 30, more than 690 college planned for bringing students back to campus for fall classes. (David Foster/Yahoo Finance)\u2018The university seems to practically want people to get sick\u2019Fraternity and sorority activities, as well as parties unrelated to Greek life, seem to be potential hotspots.At Oklahoma State University, 23 members of a sorority house tested positive for coronavirus. At the University of Washington, 15 out of 25 frat houses contained the virus, affecting 165 students at least.At Ball State University in Indiana, one student who lives beside a frat house said that she\u2019s noticed four parties since she moved in next to them two weeks ago.\u201cThe main reason it bothers me is because my college \u2026 has a horrible plan in terms of COVID prevention, and most responsibility has been placed on students,\u201d she told Yahoo Finance. \"I recognize that we\u2019re all adults and are all old enough to be responsible, but the university seems to practically want people to get sick.\u201dA student studies in an open-air seating area on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on August 18, 2020 in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.(PHOTO: Melissa Sue Gerrits/Getty Images)The junior journalism-graphics major, who chose to be anonymous for fear of retribution from the frat house, added the the largest party involved around 30 to 40 people gathering. The university did not respond to request for comment.On the UNC Greensboro campus, 19-year-old political science major Laura Comino said that parties, recruiting events, and other events involving potentially close contact are still a reality.\"I live in an apartment building that's owned by the university, and the first thing I saw moving in was a billboard that says coronavirus is real with a poop emoji,\u201d Comino said (photo below). \u201cAnd it makes me feel [like]: Well, if you feel that you have to put up those billboards and ... if my professors have to wear masks while they lecture, is it really safe for us to be on campus?\u201d(PHOTO: Laura Camino)Comino considered moving off campus, but decided against signing a lease after considering the uncertainty of whether the school would be open for long.\u201cI feel like I'm an intruder and I really shouldn't be here,\u201d she added.At the University of North Georgia, a video circulated on social media revealing hundreds of people at an off-campus party. At the same time, 18-year-old University of Georgia students Maggie Mitchell and Zainub Ali are trying to figure out how they would avoid losing more than $3,000 if they move out of their apartments.\u201cClasses start on the 20th \u2026 and I honestly am not positive if some of my classes are going to be in-person because a lot of my professors still haven't reached out,\u201d Mitchell said, adding that the entire situation has been \u201cvery stressful.\u201dStudents wear protective masks as they wait in line at a testing site for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) set up for returning students, faculty and staff on the main New York University (NYU) campus in Manhattan, New York City, New York, U.S., August 18, 2020. REUTERS/Mike Segar\u2018We have enough information about what this is and how it spreads\u2019There are colleges that haven\u2019t bungled the fall semester.Goldrick-Rab cited Michael Sorrell, president of Paul Quinn College, a historically Black university in Texas, as an example of reopening done right while some college leaders \u201cput money over safety of their students, staff, and faculty.\u201dSorrell, who made the call to skip in-person classes in July, told Inside Higher Ed that preventing the spread of coronavirus on campus was too onerous a task.\"We have enough information about what this is and how it spreads,\u201d he said of the decision. \u201cOn top of that, I think it\u2019s fascinating people acted as if they didn\u2019t know their own student populations. How does anyone purport to police the social engagements of 18- to 25-year-olds?\u201dDear Higher Ed:There is absolutely no way to consistently control, regulate, police - or whatever term you choose - the social engagement of 18-25 year olds on most college campuses. You have to know that. That is a big reason why in-person learning cannot work right now.\u2014 Michael Sorrell (@michaelsorrell) August 18, 2020A lack of funding for public education, Goldrick-Rab noted, forced colleges to choose between public safety and avoiding bankruptcy since schools make a significant portion of their incomes through housing and food.\u201cThey are leaning on those areas to balance their budgets \u2014 at the publics that\u2019s because of state defunding,\u201d she said, adding that schools without sizable endowments \u201care deciding to close only after realizing they have no choice.\u201d\u2014Aarthi Swaminathan is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering education.
