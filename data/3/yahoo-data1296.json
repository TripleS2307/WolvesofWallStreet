Google contends that a victory for Oracle would stifle the ability of developers to create new and innovative applications, like those that measure your heart rate.\u201cGinsburg in particular has been the strongest voice on the court in favor of intellectual property owners,\u201d Tyler Ochoa, a professor of law at Santa Clara University School of Law and an expert on copyright law, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cIt would have been very easy to predict that she likely would have voted in favor of Oracle, and without her on the court, that\u2019s one less vote in favor of Oracle, and it makes it somewhat more likely that Google will prevail.\u201dU.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is seen during a group portrait session for the new full court at the Supreme Court in Washington, U.S., November 30, 2018. REUTERS/Jim YoungOn Oct. 7, the first week of its fall term, the high court will hear Google v. Oracle, which Google has referred to as the \u201ccopyright lawsuit of the decade.\u201d The dispute centers on the Java platform, which Oracle acquired when it bought Sun Microsystems in 2010.In the long-running lawsuit, Oracle claims Google violated copyright law by using the Java language\u2019s APIs to build Android, the world\u2019s most popular operating system for mobile phones. But Google countered, in a brief asking the high court to overturn an appeals court\u2019s decision in favor of Oracle, that its use of the APIs in Android constituted \u201cfair use\u201d that was not subject to copyright protection.Story continues\u2018Profound consequences for innovation\u2019The case has drawn an unusual amount of attention, attracting dozens of amicus briefs from professors, trade groups, advocacy groups, and fellow tech giant Microsoft (MSFT) \u2014 which came out in support of Google and noted that the issue presented by the case has \u201cprofound consequences for innovation in today\u2019s computer industry.\u201d The appeals court ruling in Oracle\u2019s favor, Microsoft said, \u201cthreatens modern paradigms of software development.\u201dOracle CEO Safra Catz delivers a keynote address during the 2019 Oracle OpenWorld on September 17, 2019 in San Francisco, California.

(More recently, the government expressed its support for Oracle in a separate matter \u2014 its partnership with the Chinese social media sensation TikTok.)While it\u2019s rare that Ginsburg would come down on the same side as the Trump administration, intellectual property lawsuits tend to be less politicized than other cases like, for example, those related to abortion or the Affordable Care Act. Ginsburg was known for having a \u201cdeep understanding\u201d of copyright law and respect for holders of copyrights, according to Barbara Lauriat, a senior lecturer on intellectual property law at King\u2019s College of London.With Ginsburg gone, Google v. Oracle could end with a 4-4 tie. In that case, the lower court\u2019s ruling for Oracle would stand but would not have precedential effect \u2014 in other words, it would not be the law of the land. This was the case back in 1996, in another dispute that involved the extent of software copyright. In that case, Lotus v. Borland, Justice John Paul Stevens recused himself and the case was tied, meaning it set no national precedent.That could very well end up happening with the Google-Oracle case, Lauriat noted, adding, \u201cWe could have history repeating itself.\u201dErin Fuchs is deputy managing editor at Yahoo Finance.See also:Microsoft lost its best chance to be the \u2018cool\u2019 tech companyOracle\u2019s Tik-Tok won gives it a chance to prove it can take on Microsoft and AmazonYour internet bill might be too high \u2014 here\u2019s how to save moneyFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and reddit."}]}
