The Senate Banking Committee\u2019s top Republican, Mike Crapo of Idaho, has clarified that he would like to see the Fed do more with its Main Street Lending Program.Crapo has urged the Fed and the Treasury to ramp up lending to small- and mid-size businesses, writing to Fed Chairman Jay Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in late July that they need to \u201cquickly expand\u201d the pipeline of emergency loans.George Selgin, director of the Cato Institute\u2019s Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives, said that Senate Republicans are mixing up its message on a policy response.\u201cDo we want to give these firms more money or not? If people can\u2019t agree on that \u2014 that\u2019s a fundamental issue,\u201d Selgin told Yahoo Finance.Story continuesMain Street Lending ProgramAlthough the Fed\u2019s emergency lending facilities cover a wide range of financial markets, Congress has been particularly fixated on the Main Street Lending Program.The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act birthed the $454 billion appropriation and directed the Fed to set up a program that \u201csupports lending to small and mid-sized businesses.\u201d The Treasury gave the Fed $75 billion to support the loans and after months of figuring out how to establish the facility, the Fed finally unveiled the program \u2014 but to little fanfare.As of Sept. 3, the facility had lent only $1.2 billion of the $600 billion in capacity that the Fed claims it could lever up to (using the Treasury equity investment). The Fed has repeatedly emphasized that the loans are not grants.Crapo has advocated for revising the Fed\u2019s EBITDA requirements for loan eligibility, arguing that companies in industries with weaker cash flow may be unable to access loans.Sen. Pat Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania, agreed that an asset-based standard may work better for the program. But in a hearing focused on the Main Street Lending Program on Wednesday, Toomey expressed doubt over the usefulness of the Main Street loans in supporting companies and industries through the entire recovery process.\u201cI think we have to ask ourselves whether this is the appropriate program to do it, and I would suggest it\u2019s not,\u201d Toomey said.The debate comes as the economy continues to work through a recovery; the unemployment rate has fallen but remains at 8.4% and data from S&P Global Market Intelligence reports that 470 companies have gone bankrupt so far in 2020 \u2014 more than any comparable period since 2010.Selgin said the ideological divide over the degree of support for small- and mid-size businesses needs to consider the role of fiscal policy, adding that paring back the Fed powers would be fine \u201cif Congress were willing to put up the money that it still feels [is] necessary.\u201dEven if passed, the GOP proposal likely faces a challenge from the Democratically controlled House of Representatives, which had previously floated a $3.5 trillion package.Brian Cheung is a reporter covering the Fed, economics, and banking for Yahoo Finance.
