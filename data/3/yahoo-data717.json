The investment bank lifted its outlook on the industrials and utilities sector on Wednesday, citing a host of reasons to get long in a space that had fallen out of favor amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201cIndustrials should benefit from improving global economic growth and potential infrastructure spending while Utilities\u2019 dividend yield relative to the level of interest rates is near a 25-year high,\u201d writes Goldman\u2019s Arjun Menon. Goldman is looking for 5.6% global GDP growth in 2021, which would be vastly improved from the 5% plunge expected this year.The Dow Transports have come on strong.Menon adds, \u201cImproving global economic growth and low interest rates should also be tailwinds to select cyclical and defensive pockets within the equity market. Within cyclicals, stocks that are most positively correlated with global economic growth should see their businesses normalize faster than companies that are more tied to the domestic economy. Among defensives, low interest rates mean total cash return yields will likely be a key determinant of performance through the remainder of this year.\u201dGoldman retained its overweight recommendation on information technology, citing attractive fundamentals. It continues to hold bearish views on health care, real estate, energy and materials.Only until recently have more cyclical areas of the market begun to catch bids. So if anything, Goldman\u2019s upgrade lends validity to a move in markets that hasn\u2019t gotten a ton of attention. Prior to Wednesday\u2019s session, the Dow Jones Transportation Average had risen for 10 straight sessions. The index has quietly outperformed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite this past month (see chart above), according to Yahoo Finance Premium data.Story continuesNot everyone on Wall Street is sold just yet on Goldman\u2019s call.\u201cWe want to see if it\u2019s more sustainable. If you look at historical cycles, once the economy truly starts to recover it is all about getting cyclical \u2014 or the stocks that got beaten down the most during the decline. They tend to rally. Normally we would have seen it by now. Because it\u2019s such a unique recession, we haven\u2019t seen it yet. So eventually, yes, it will be the big trade probably over the next 12 to 18 months,\u201d Ned Davis Research chief U.S. strategist Ed Clissold told Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade.Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
