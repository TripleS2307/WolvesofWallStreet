The former vice president leads in national opinion polls.His plan would cost $775 billion over a decade and be paid for by rolling back tax breaks for real estate investors and tightening enforcement of the existing U.S. tax code.As a first step, the plan would send federal aid to state and local governments to keep childcare programs and other public services operating.Ultimately, the plan would seek to create 3 million jobs in the healthcare and education sectors, while bolstering the workforce overall by 5 million by allowing people who were taking care of children or relatives to rejoin the labor force.As part of the proposal, Biden pledges to provide all 3-year-old and 4-year-old children access to free preschool, which the campaign says would save parents thousands of dollars a year in childcare costs.\u201cThis is fundamentally an economic plan,\u201d said a campaign aide who requested anonymity in order to discuss details of the proposal. \u201cThis is a core pillar of Joe Biden\u2019s jobs and economic recovery agenda.\u201dBiden previously released proposals aimed at boosting U.S. manufacturing and building clean-energy infrastructure projects as the country continues to reel from a pandemic that has killed more than 140,000 in the United States and resulted in a net loss of almost 15 million jobs.(Reporting by James Oliphant; Editing by Peter Cooney)"}]}
