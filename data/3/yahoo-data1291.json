When approved, they \u201cwill receive an initial obligation of three weeks of needed funding,\u201d according to the FEMA guidelines. Any extra after that will be decided on a week-by-week basis until the funds deplete.\u201cIt all depends on whether or not there's enough money in the disaster relief fund,\u201d Michele Evermore, a senior policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project, told Yahoo Money.US President Donald Trump signs executive orders extending coronavirus economic relief, during a news conference in Bedminster, New Jersey, on August 8, 2020.

For instance, Iowa\u2019s Gov. Kim Reynolds this weekend requested $4 billion for those affected by the recent derecho storm in her state. The request was approved by the president.\u201cThey're applying for FEMA aid and it's the exact same pot of money that's being used for employment insurance benefits,\u201d Evermore said. \u201cI imagine this will happen more than once in the next month.\u201dThe disaster relief fund has more than $70 billion. Under Trump\u2019s memorandum, up to $44 billion is available for unemployment benefits. But this sum can also be used for aid if a disaster occurs. If the total amount in the fund dips below $25 billion, any remaining money can be used only for disaster relief, not unemployment benefits.Read more: Here\u2019s what you need to know about unemployment benefits eligibilityAfter the states get approved for funding, \u201cit can take several weeks\u201d for the extra benefit to be distributed, according to Evermore.This comes as more than 28 million Americans have lost the extra $600 in weekly unemployment benefits under the CARES Act at the end of July and have since seen a drop in benefits ranging from 52% to 72%, according to an analysis by Evercore ISI.Story continuesUnemployed Americans see a drop in their unemployment benefits between 52% to 72% without the extra $600, according to an analysis by Evercore ISI. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)Which states have committed to paying the benefits?So far, seven states have been approved to receive unemployment funding: Arizona, Colorado, Iowa Louisiana, Missouri, New Mexico, and Utah. Arizona is the only state that has received the funding already.\u201cArizona has actually already received the money that they're paying out in benefits,\u201d Evermore said. \u201cI'm not sure what they're doing in Arizona. What they might have done is set up their own side system last week to pay a benefit and they're just getting that reimbursed.\u201dTo apply for the benefits, states must put together a memorandum with FEMA, showing they have the ability to administer the funds and certifying they have a match that works.States have two options for matching the benefit. One option allows states to count $100 in unemployment benefits they are already paying out to recipients as the extra $100 described in Trump\u2019s memorandum. The second option is for states to find funds to provide an additional $100.Yahoo Money sister site Cashay has a weekly newsletter.South Dakota is the first state to decline the additional benefits. The state governor cited that the state has recovered most of the jobs lost due to COVID-19, and that it has the lowest insured unemployment rate in the nation.The insured unemployment rate shows what percent of the labor force is currently collecting Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefits and leaves out those collecting benefits like Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) that 10 million Americans are receiving.\u201cIt's really hard to get an Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefit in South Dakota,\u201d Evermore said. \u201cThey don't have the lowest unemployment rate, but they have the lowest insured unemployment rate.\u201dDenitsa is a writer for Yahoo Finance and Cashay, a new personal finance website.
