An analysis by Yahoo Finance found a range of nationwide polls that month which asked some version of the \u201cwho do you trust to do a better job on the economy\u201d question.Biden was ahead or tied with Trump in almost all of them. A July 19 Fox News poll had it at 44% for Biden and 43% for Trump (within the margin of error). A July 15 Quinnipiac poll gave Biden a \u201cslight lead\u201d on the issue: 50% to 45%. All that after Trump had built his re-election campaign largely around his economic acumen. Other polls found similar results with the two candidates often tied on the economy (each outfit asks the question a bit differently).Fast forward to this month. Biden has maintained his edge on who people say they\u2019ll actually vote for but the gap has narrowed and that shift has been the most pronounced on economic questions.An Aug. 17 CNN poll made waves showing the Biden/Harris ticket with just a 4-point lead overall. It also showed a clear deficit for Democrats on the economy. Trump led by 8 points \u2013 53% to 45% \u2013 when respondents were asked about the economy and which candidate \u201cwould better handle that issue if they were elected President.\u201dFormer vice-president and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden at the end of the third day of the Democratic National Convention.

Tanden says her party\u2019s convention \u201cis a real opportunity for a lot of speakers to describe why a Biden-Harris administration will actually improve the country and improve the economy and keep people's public health safe.\u201dIn response to questions about the president\u2019s rebound on the economy, the Trump campaign\u2019s deputy national press secretary, Courtney Parella, pointed to \u201cthree straight months of record job growth with 9.3 million jobs created in just three months.\u201d Prior to the gains in May, June, and July, employers cut 20.5 million jobs as the pandemic took hold.Story continuesParella added that Biden \u201cembraces the far-left\u2019s socialist manifesto\u201d on things like taxes and China.\u2018COVID is the economy and the economy is COVID\u2019The Democrats Wednesday night\u2019s convention program included a section on \u201ca more perfect economy,\u201d capped off by a speech from Sen. Elizabeth Warren. The Democrats allocated a sizable chunk of the 10 p.m. hour to the issue, although Thursday\u2019s headlines have largely been reserved for the speeches that followed from Barack Obama and Kamala Harris.Jim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at the center-left group Third Way, told Yahoo Finance that the polling deficit can be overcome. \u201cI'd say my advice to Democrats is: COVID is the economy and the economy is COVID,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just would have to tie those two things together at all times.\u201dThe coronavirus question is clearly better terrain for the Biden campaign. The CNN poll mentioned above \u2013 which found Trump ahead on the economy \u2013 showed the president down by 9 points (43% to 52%) when the same respondents were asked who would better handle the response to the coronavirus outbreak. Other polls have shown similar Biden advantages.\u201cWe have a demand problem in the economy right now,\u201d Tanden said. \u201cThe first step is to get the virus contained.\u201dPresident Donald Trump awaits the arrival of Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi outside the West Wing on Thursday. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)The questions of \u2018issue ownership\u2019Polling experts often talk about the concept of \u201cissue ownership,\u201d which boils down to the different issues that voters typically associate with a party.Democrats traditionally take ownership when the questions turn to things like the social safety net, health care, and whether the candidate \u201ccares about people like you.\u201d Biden has commanding leads on all these fronts.Republicans traditionally take ownership when the topics turn to law and order, security, and the military. Trump \u2013 like most Republicans \u2013 is indeed polling stronger on these issues, if not ahead in many cases.Some polling experts think of economic questions as a traditional GOP strength but it\u2019s far from universal in recent history.\u201cGo back and look at Bill Clinton,\u201d said Robert Shapiro, a polling expert and professor at Columbia University. Clinton oversaw a booming economy and considerable support from voters on the economy.On Trump, he said, \u201cpeople are differentiating his misbehavior, his bad choice of words, his bullying and so forth, and they separate that out from this performance on the economy.\u201d That's why \u201che's always been doing better on the economy than in general.\u201dTrump\u2019s economic numbers have rebounded in August, but the improvement \u2013 so far at least \u2013 has not been enough to pull him too much closer to Biden on the horse race numbers.RealClearPolitics shows a Biden lead in every national poll since April, and currently gives him a 7.6-point edge over Trump on who people say they\u2019re planning to vote for.Ben Werschkul is a producer for Yahoo Finance in Washington, DC.Read more:Biden's tax plan: Eyes on the 1% and corporations like AmazonTerry McAuliffe on why \u2018business should be happy that Joe Biden is coming in\u2019Michigan\u2019s governor on whether Biden has her state sewn up: \u2018I don't buy it for a second\u2019Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit."}]}
