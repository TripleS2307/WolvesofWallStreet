Netflix is the \u201cN\u201d in \u201cFAANG,\u201d after all. But co-founder and co-CEO Reed Hastings says Netflix has a key advantage over competitors: a singular focus.In an interview with Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer, Hastings pointed out that while boundlessly deep-pocketed firms like Amazon and Apple are pushing further into the entertainment business, they aren\u2019t singularly dedicated to content.\u201cYou know, they're doing a lot of things that are interesting, but we're focused on being a great entertainment company,\u201d he said, referring to Amazon and Apple. \u201cWe have the advantage of a single focus, this is all what we are about. And we work really hard to continue to be the best in the world at it.\u201dHastings spoke to Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer in an episode of \u201cInfluencers with Andy Serwer,\u201d a weekly interview series with leaders in business, politics, and entertainment.A good decade for Netflix, and a boost from the coronavirusAnd Netflix has exploited that focus to dramatic affect. The company had the best performing stock of the last decade \u2014 climbing an outrageous 3,700%, far beyond its competitors.Reed Hastings, co-founder and CEO of Netflix, gestures during an event of the Fundacion Telmex Mexico Siglo XXI (Telmex Foundation Mexico XXI Century) in Mexico City, Mexico, September 6, 2019. REUTERS/Edgard GarridoIt\u2019s also been a massive beneficiary of the global lockdowns caused by the novel coronavirus. The company added nearly 16 million global subscribers in the first quarter of the year, as people locked down in their homes \u2014 a 23% jump from the same quarter the prior year. The momentum continued into the spring, when the streaming giant added another 10.1 million global users for the second quarter.Netflix\u2019s stock price has climbed along with its user base. On March 19, just before statewide shutdowns began rolling out across the U.S., Netflix was trading at $332.03 per share. At the close of markets on Sept. 10, it was trading at $480.67.Formidable competitorsStill, Amazon and Apple have been producing appealing content of their own. And with Amazon Prime Video available for $8.99 per month, or included with a Prime subscription, and Apple TV+ just $4.99 per month, they\u2019re able to easily undercut or match Netflix\u2019s entry-level price of $8.99. Subscribers pay $15.99 for a premium Netflix subscription.Story continuesWhat\u2019s more, Amazon has proven that it has what it takes to make not just award-winning content, but content that can penetrate the zeitgeist. Look no further than the likes of \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d \u201cThe Man in the High Castle,\u201d and \u201cThe Boys.\u201dApple\u2019s Apple TV+ service., meanwhile is available for free for 12 months when you purchase certain new Apple products.

And then you know, for again, for about 15 bucks a month you get amazing content.\u201dGot a tip?
