U.S. hotels have lost more than $46 billion in booking revenue since mid-February, according to the American Hotel & Lodging Association (AHLA). In May, U.S. hotel profit fell by 105% vs. May 2019. The industry is projecting a 50% drop in revenue for 2020 overall. As of July 30, more than half of the open hotel rooms in the U.S. were sitting empty.\u201cThe effects have been about 10 times worse than [after] 9/11,\u201d Best Western CEO David Kong told Yahoo Finance this week.But now many Americans are at last beginning to venture out and (cautiously) travel\u2014mostly in the form of summer road trips\u2014and in many cases, they will choose between hotels and Airbnb houses.Kong makes the case that hotel chains are safer and cleaner than Airbnbs right now, thanks to the AHLA\u2019s \u201cSafe Stay\u201d program, which establishes uniform room cleaning protocols.\u201cAll the major hotel brands have implemented that,\u201d says Kong. \u201cAnd people should feel very safe and secure and comfortable staying at major hotels. That\u2019s a little different than Airbnb, which is not regulated and also does not provide the same reassurance.\u201dKong\u2019s comments come just as Airbnb on Wednesday filed its IPO papers with the SEC, even after its revenue fell 70% in Q2 and its valuation has been cut to $18 billion from $31 billion.Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky told NPR\u2019s \u201cHow I Built This\u201d podcast earlier this month that Airbnb\u2019s bookings in July were \u201cat or above last year\u2019s levels... nobody knows if this is pent up-demand or not, but we're around last year's levels all around the world.\u201dOf course, it behooves Kong to say this about a competitor, one that is about to go public. And Airbnb did announce in April an \u201cenhanced cleaning initiative\u201d for hosts, \u201cinformed by the CDC published standards... and leading experts such as Dr. Vivek Murthy, former Surgeon General of the United States.\u201dStory continuesBut to Kong\u2019s point: Airbnb hosts operate independently of one another, and are not beholden to any third party governance apart from the possibility of a traveler lodging a complaint with Airbnb over cleanliness.Housekeeper sprays sanitizing spray in a room of the Costa Baja hotel on July 30, 2020 in La Paz, Mexico. (Photo by Alfredo Martinez/Getty Images)Despite his cleanliness claims, Kong gives Airbnb a lot of credit as a competitor. \u201cAirbnb has had an impact on our industry since it came into being,\u201d he says. \u201cThey had very good marketing campaigns... They made it sound like fun to stay at homes rather than hotels. In the major cities, there have been different reports that the impact is anywhere from 3% to 10%.\u201dWhen Airbnb does debut on the public markets, its competitive threat to traditional hotel chains is sure to be a focal point.Kong, for his part, says that Best Western has seen a recovery since Memorial Day Weekend, but he remains \u201creally concerned about the future, because fall is coming, and that\u2019s traditionally when leisure business slows down dramatically and is replaced by meetings and convention business, and as we all know, this pandemic has dramatically compromised that segment. And then winter is traditionally a very slow period for the hotel industry.\u201d\u2014Daniel Roberts is an editor-at-large at Yahoo Finance and closely covers tech.
