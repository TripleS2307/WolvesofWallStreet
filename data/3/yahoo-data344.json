Pew Research data released this week show that at least 65% of Americans have adopted the near constant use of personal protective equipment (PPE).However, social distancing and the use of masks in public have become a source of contention among those who feel it violates their personal freedoms.In a series of interviews, doctors on the front lines in states where COVID-19 infections are exploding lamented the controversy in stark terms. They argue that mixed messages from mayors, governors and President Donald Trump are making it harder for people to appreciate the need for masking \u2014 especially as infections among younger citizens jump sharply.\u201cHonestly the politicization of science is one of our incredible societal downfalls. Science should not be politics,\u201d Dr. Hilary Fairbrother, a Houston emergency medicine physician, told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday. The Lone Star state is in the throes of a record number of cases that threatens to overwhelm health systems in major cities like Dallas and Houston.Fairbrother said the debate has become a Hobson\u2019s choice that lacks nuance, between those who want to \u201cclose down the entire world for at least 3 years until there is no coronavirus left in any corner of the planet,\u201d and others who are unconcerned about rising casualties.\u201cThere\u2019s no middle ground, there\u2019s no common sense or application of good science,\u201d she added. \u201cI beg people to start listening to scientists, and stop listening to politicians on all things coronavirus.\u201dStory continuesThere are over 2.3 million coronavirus cases in the U.S. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)\u2018A very different culture\u2019When the outbreak first led to mass restrictions on public life, some experts cautioned that Americans \u2014 accustomed as they are to constitutionally protected freedoms \u2014 were ill-prepared to accept how a raging pandemic would affect their quality of life.Those warnings have been proven prescient, as quarantine fatigue and protests against social injustice have led many to abandon anti-coronavirus protections designed to bend the curve of new infections.Many of the states now on the outbreak\u2019s front lines are struggling to balance individual rights with the mandates of a public health crisis, and falling short of the mark. Citizens, as well as investors, are banking on the idea that the latest surge of infections won\u2019t lead to a renewal of restrictive stay-at-home orders that crushed the global economy.\u201cI\u2019m not a constitutional scholar but this is what happens when you try and use federalism at the science level,\u201d said Dr. Murtaza Akhter, an assistant professor in the University of Arizona\u2019s Department of Emergency Medicine. The Grand Canyon State has nearly 60,000 cases and around 1500 deaths, and has been the center of a raucous public debate over mask-wearing in public.\u201cThe fact that people are still saying \u2018this is America, do what you want\u2019 that\u2019s fine from a legal or constitutional perspective, but from a public health and science perspective that\u2019s a terrible idea,\u201d Akhter said.\u201cWe have a very different culture here. There\u2019s no other country I know of in the world that debates masks,\u201d Akhter added. \u201cPeople don't even debate seatbelts anymore... but to debate masks during a pandemic is so utterly ironic that it's hard to comprehend.\u201dAkhter, who accused Arizona\u2019s governor of \u201cpassing the buck\u201d on using face masks, said the coronavirus \u201cdoesn\u2019t know state, city borders or national borders, it transcends all borders and all people. So the problem with having some people wearing masks and others not wearing them, is that the threat [of spreading] is still going to be there.\u201dIn Houston, where hospital capacity is nearing a breaking point, the dire situation has become an empirical study in how a lack of policy coordination can lead to dire consequences. Texas Governor Greg Abbott has come under fire for downplaying the need for masks, and allowing mayors to make their own calls for a mandate.\u201cThe biggest concern is that we\u2019re going to lose a handle on the situation,\u201d Cedric Dark, an assistant professor at Texas\u2019 Baylor College of Medicine, told Yahoo Finance. He was critical of Abbott\u2019s decision to reopen the economy in May, despite an earlier suggestion that the state could corral a COVID-19 surge.After the reopening, \u201cthose cases started going up, not only linearly but exponentially,\u201d Dark said.\u201cUnless we battle it back now, we\u2019re going to be forced to shut everything down [again]...I think people need to realize it. We need to dial it back and go back to where we were in Phase 1,\u201d the physician added.Javier David is an editor for Yahoo Finance.
