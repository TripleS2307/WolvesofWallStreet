When added to existing inequities, the strain of student loans is \u201creinforcing social stratification and segregation across neighborhoods,\u201d the report stated.The data \u201chighlights how student debt is increasingly a racial and economic justice issue,\u201d SBPC stated in an email to Yahoo Finance.(GRAPHIC: Student Borrower Protection Center/June 2020)Debt distress more prevalent on non-white neighborhoodsThe SBPC research noted that borrower distress is \u201cheavily concentrated\u201d in neighborhoods populated by mostly Black and Latinx people.The researchers found that in D.C., six of the eight neighborhoods where student loan debt is growing the fastest are populated mostly by minorities.That matches existing data: While median debt balances in some of the whitest neighborhoods (such as Adams Morgan and Foggy Bottom) in D.C. decreased by 30% over the last decade, debt balances in several majority-Black neighborhoods such as Brookland and Deanwood grew by as much as 217%.Latio Cosmos, who recently graduated from Seattle University with a degree in public affairs, participates in the Juneteenth Freedom March and Celebration on June 19, 2020 in Seattle, Washington.

And the three neighborhoods where student loans saw a delinquency rate lower than 5% are at least 75% white, the authors noted.Story continuesThe same issue presents itself in D.C.: In Chevy Chase and DuPont Circle, delinquency rates on student loans are around 1-2%. In Congress Heights (94% non-white), the delinquency rate is 35%.(GRAPHiC: Student Borrower Protection Center/June 2020)The findings reveal an irony present within higher education, the authors concluded.\u201cWhere higher education once stood as a promised gateway to the middle class, the reality is much bleaker,\u201d the authors stated. \u201cThe disparities in the student loan market rival outcomes borne of the most predatory redlining tactics perpetrated by unscrupulous lenders. This cost is uniquely borne by borrowers of color, particularly Black and Latinx borrowers \u2014 all incurred simply because they chose to pursue the American Dream.\u201d\u2014Aarthi is a writer for Yahoo Finance.
