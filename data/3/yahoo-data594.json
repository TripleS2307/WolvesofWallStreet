Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy said the exclusion likely reflects the challenges in adding a company of Tesla's size to the index.Bets against Tesla's stock have also increased slightly over the last month, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners.On Tuesday morning, short interest in Tesla was $25.03 billion, with about 8.10% of its outstanding shares shorted.Tesla's recent stock rally has been driven by its blockbuster quarterly results and on bets it would be added to the S&P 500, which would trigger massive demand for its shares from index funds that track the benchmark.(Reporting by Subrat Patnaik, additional reporting by Munsif Vengattil and Noor Zainab Hussain in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta, Aditya Soni and Krishna Chandra Eluri)"}]}
