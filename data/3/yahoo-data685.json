This cohort has been among the winners of the \u201cwork from home\u201d phenomenon that\u2019s defined the coronavirus era.U.S. data continues to show resilience, with construction spending nearly flat in July, but with the prior month revised sharply higher. Meanwhile, the manufacturing sector continues to rebound, with the ISM Manufacturing Index hitting its highest levels since August 2018. New orders jumped during the month, but the employment component remained in recession territory \u2014 in line with still fragile labor market.Benchmarks closed out a monster August by notching their best month in at least 20 years, bolstered by ultra-accomodative Federal Reserve policy, moderating coronavirus infections and rising optimism for a COVID-19 vaccine that may backstop economic growth.A formidable string of consecutive winning sessions carried the Dow over 7% higher during August \u2014 its best monthly showing since 1986. The S&P 500 Index also saw its best month since 1986, while a brisk rally in tech stocks propelled the Nasdaq to its best monthly performance since 2000, representing a nearly 10% gain.All told, stocks are now deeply entrenched in a new bull market, less than 6 months after a vicious sell-off sparked by the COVID-19 outbreak obliterated all of the Trump era gains.Story continuesAccording to Goldman Sachs, \u201cwhile equities have never been as expensive since the Tech bubble, based on a 24-month [price/earnings basis], the equity risk premium is close to an all-time high, suggesting that equities have rarely been as attractive relative to bonds.\u201dAdditionally, July\u2019s high-frequency economic data broadly outperformed Wall Street\u2019s estimates, the latest being robust personal income and spending data released on Friday. Taken together, economists now believe that third quarter growth could be \u201ceven boomier\u201d than prior estimates, JPMorgan Chase said on Friday.Traders have been encouraged by Fed policy that continues to encourage risk appetite, and the COVID-19 outbreak that has shown signs of tapering off in the Sun Belt region \u2014 which until very recently had been a domestic epicenter of new infections. Additionally, encouraging developments in the race for a vaccine have given the market reasons for hope.\u20144:03 p.m. ET: Stocks start September on a high note as S&P 500, Nasdaq set new closing highsHere were the main moves in markets as of 4:03 p.m. ET:S&P 500 (^GSPC): +26.35 (+0.75%) to 3,526.66Dow (^DJI): +215.74 (+0.76%) to 28,645.79Nasdaq (^IXIC): +164.21 (+1.39%) to 11,939.67Crude (CL=F): +$0.29 (+0.68%) to $42.90 a barrelGold (GC=F): -$1.80 (-0.09%) to $1,976.80 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): -2.1 bps to yield 0.6720%\u201412:10 p.m. ET: Stocks creep to session highs in quiet sessionHere were the main moves in markets as of 12:10 p.m. ET:S&P 500 (^GSPC): 3,512.36, +12.05 (+0.34%)Dow (^DJI): 28,510.69, +80.64 (+0.28%)Nasdaq (^IXIC): 11,895.52, +120.06 (+1.02%)Crude (CL=F): $43.10, +$0.49 (+1.15%)Gold (GC=F): $1,989.60, +$11.00 (+0.56%)10-year Treasury (^TNX): flat to yield 0.695%\u201410:15 a.m. ET: Construction spending all but unchangedHigh-frequency data has been surprising to the upside, but July\u2019s construction spending was one of the few outliers. Commerce Department data showed that outlays on private projects were nearly cancelled out by a swan dive in public construction. That said, June\u2019s data was sharply revised higher.\u201410:00 a.m. ET: Manufacturing rebound continuesThe ISM manufacturing index inched up in August, to 56.0 from 54.2, in line with most data points that suggest the U.S. recovery is on firm footing and the highest in about a year.However, economists have flagged a couple of cracks in what would otherwise be a silver lining. Andrew Hunter at Capital Economics notes that:... the recovery in production is badly lagging the stronger turnaround in spending, with the result that inventories are now looking very lean. That points to further gains in production in the months ahead and, unusually for this stage of the cycle, probably upward pressure on goods price inflation too.The improvement was driven by a further jump in the new orders index to a 16-year high of 67.6, from 61.5. The production index also saw a further rise to 63.3, from 62.1, consistent with manufacturing output growth of nearly 10% in 3m/3m annualized terms. That said... The ISM report suggests the recovery in employment continues to lag behind, with that sub-index rising to only 46.4, from 44.3, but that is probably because employment never fell as sharply as output in the first place, and therefore has less ground to recover.Admittedly, with the non-manufacturing index having already risen above 58 in July, the ISM surveys suggest that the manufacturing sector continues to lag behind. But with durable goods consumption already more than 10% above its pre-pandemic level and inventories now unusually low \u2013 the ISM manufacturing inventories index fell further in August to a record low \u2013 production should continue to rebound at a solid pace over the next few months.\u20149:35 a.m. ET: Stocks open mixed, tech resumes rallyHere were the main moves in markets as of 9:35 a.m. ET:S&P 500 (^GSPC): 3,499.61, -0.70 (-0.02%)Dow (^DJI): 28,349.38, -80.67 (-0.28%)Nasdaq (^IXIC): 11,832.50, +57.05 (+0.48%)Crude (CL=F): $42.93, +$0.32 (+0.75%)Gold (GC=F): $1,998.30 per ounce, +$19.70 (+1.00%)10-year Treasury (^TNX): +2.5 bps to yield 0.7160%\u20148:25 a.m. ET: Zoom, the other stock investors loveThe pandemic era has turned Zoom (ZM) into a must-have on virtually every computer/mobile device, and the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings report reflects this. A monster quarter saw the company beat estimates by a mile and hike its annual revenue forecast by more than 30%, on the heels of converting more free users into paid subscribers.Zoom\u2019s stock, which closed up nearly 9% on Monday, is rallying by a staggering 38% in the pre-market.\u20148:00 a.m. ET: Tesla eyes $5 billion share offeringTesla Inc CEO Elon Musk takes off his coat onstage during a delivery event for Tesla China-made Model 3 cars in Shanghai, China January 7, 2020. REUTERS/Aly SongInvestors can\u2019t seem to get enough of Tesla\u2019s (TSLA) stock (which hit a record on the same day the stock split), so the House that Elon Musk built is offering them more of what they crave. Tesla will raise up to $5 billion in a share sale that will be led by Wall Street\u2019s main brokers.The news comes just a day after the company\u2019s successfully split its stock 5-1.
