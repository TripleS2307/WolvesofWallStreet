Borrowers had to self-certify that they need the loan due to economic uncertainty and that they needed the money to cover payroll or other eligible expenses.\u201c...Reliance on applicant self-certifications can leave a program vulnerable to exploitation by those who wish to circumvent eligibility requirements or pursue criminal activities,\u201d said the GAO.The report also found that confusing guidance \u201chas increased the likelihood that borrowers may misuse loan proceeds or be surprised they do not qualify for full loan forgiveness.\u201d (According to the SBA, businesses must spend at least 60% of the loan for payroll in order for it to be forgiven.)Jovita Carranza, Administrator U.S. Small Business Administration, testifies as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin looks on, during a Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship hearing to examine implementation of Title I of the CARES Act, Wednesday, June 10, 2020 on Capitol Hill in Washington. (Kevin Dietsch/Pool via AP)The GAO recommends SBA develop a plan to address PPP risks, and put it into action in order to protect the program\u2019s integrity and address potential fraud.\u201cBecause SBA had limited time to implement up-front safeguards for the loan approval process and assess program risks, ongoing oversight will be crucial,\u201d said the GAO. \u201cSBA has announced efforts to implement safeguards after loan approval but has provided limited information on how it will implement these safeguards.\u201dThe Treasury Department and SBA have said they would review loans larger than $2 million, but the GAO said as of June 15 it had not received any information about how or when the agencies plan to conduct those reviews.Story continues\u201cFurther, SBA had not informed us of any specific oversight plans for the more than 4 million loans of less than $2 million, including how it would identify which loans to review and the number of reviews planned,\u201d said the report.The GAO report also found that more than 1 million dead Americans received a coronavirus stimulus payment totaling over $1.4 billion.SBA failed to provide critical informationThe watchdog said the Small Business Administration has failed to provide information \u201ccritical to our review, including a detailed description of data on loans made.\u201d\u201cMost agencies were generally able to provide GAO timely access to information for this report while executing their responsibilities during this unprecedented national crisis. In this regard, they have shown that it is not only possible but imperative to cooperate in a meaningful way with oversight of the trillions of dollars of public money appropriated in the COVID-19 relief laws as they carry out their responsibilities,\u201d the GAO said in the report.The GAO said it continues to work with SBA officials to get the data and other information.The Administrator of the Small Business Administration Jovita Carranza speaks during the daily briefing on the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, in the Brady Briefing Room at the White House on April 2, 2020, in Washington, DC.

While the decision satisfied some Republicans, many Democratic lawmakers say it\u2019s not enough transparency.\u201cI frankly think if you sign up for a taxpayer dollars \u2014for a loan-to-grant \u2014the fact that you\u2019ve received that loan-to-grant should be public. That\u2019s how we manage to report back to the American people that we\u2019ve spent their money wisely,\u201d said Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) in an interview with Yahoo Finance on Wednesday.On Thursday, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) and Rep. Katie Porter (D-CA) introduced legislation to require SBA to release data on all PPP loans.\u201cLet\u2019s be clear: all data on borrowers receiving PPP loans must be made publicly searchable, online, and regularly updated,\u201d said Harris in a statement.The Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis will hold a hearing with the GAO on Friday.\u201cToday\u2019s GAO report comes as our nation faces the grim reality that the Trump Administration\u2019s policies have failed to contain the coronavirus outbreak,\u201d Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-SC), the chairman of the subcommittee, said in a statement.\u201cGAO has also sounded the alarm on the Administration\u2019s efforts to stymy legitimate oversight by withholding \u2018critical\u2019 information and preventing GAO from completing its work. This obstruction must end,\u201d said Clyburn.Jessica Smith is a reporter for Yahoo Finance based in Washington, D.C.
