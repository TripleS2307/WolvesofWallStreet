But we\u2019re looking at a multiplying, ripple effect on that because for every 100 airline jobs, [there] are about 300 other jobs that are supported. Those are the folks that work at the news stands. Those are the folks that work in the airports at restaurants, in the hotel industry \u2014 so massive loss in the airline industry, but great, great economic harm all around, to come.\u201dThe union, among other labor representatives, has requested a 6-month extension of the CARES Act relief that would provide enough funding to continue the Act\u2019s moratorium on involuntary furloughs.Story continuesSenate Republicans unveiled a scaled-back coronavirus relief package on Tuesday, but Congress has made little headway in negotiating another stimulus bill.In addition to service cuts, Carlson said the industry is vulnerable to economic shortfalls that will come from its inability to quickly get furloughed workers back up and running when passenger traffic rebounds.James Carlson speaks to Yahoo Finance's The First Trade.\u201cIt\u2019s not like workers that work in supermarkets, for example, where if you get called back to work you can just come back to work,\u201d Carlson said, explaining that airline and airport staff must undergo renewed background checks, drug and alcohol testing, and training that can take up to two months.\u2018We need Congress to do their jobs\u2019Despite bipartisan support for additional aid, IAMAW is concerned that time is running out.\u201cAirlines and the unions agree, but nobody can seem to get it done,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cWe need Congress to do their jobs, and get it done, because if they don't, we're going to have a major problem on our hands.\u201dAsked whether the union would support a measure for stimulus funds that would maintain industry jobs for fewer than 6 months, Carlson said he believes that 6 months is the appropriate amount of time to allow for the potential adoption of a COVID-19 vaccine that could spur passenger demand.Since July, major U.S. airlines have sent \u201cwarn notices\u201d to staff both to offer voluntary leave options such as temporary furloughs and early retirement, as well as put staff on notice of potential involuntary layoffs.American Airlines (AAL) announced it could cut up to 19,000 jobs if no additional funding is received from the federal government. Delta Air Lines (DAL) has said it may have to furlough nearly 2,000 pilots. United Airlines (UAL) said it would lay off around 16,000 workers.According to Reuters, the airline reached a tentative agreement with its pilots\u2019 union to avoid pilot furloughs.Read more:Delta, American, United end change fees in an effort to get Americans flying againAlexis Keenan is a reporter for Yahoo Finance and former litigation attorney.Follow Alexis Keenan on Twitter @alexiskweed."}]}
