Speaking to Yahoo Finance, Amazon\u2019s Head of Worldwide Sustainability Kara Hurst said the move was yet another step to use the e-commerce giant\u2019s \u201cscale for good\u201d as it sets aggressive targets to become carbon neutral by 2040.\u201cThis is where the future is going, this is where our products and services are needed, and the fund is another signal on the investment that we\u2019re willing to make,\u201d said Hurst, on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Ticker.The Climate Pledge Fund will invest in companies across multiple sectors, though its initial focus will be on transportation and logistics; energy generation, storage, and utilization; manufacturing and materials; circular economy; and food and agriculture, Amazon said.The fund is the latest step by the Seattle-based company to reduce its carbon footprint amid explosive growth in its e-commerce and cloud computing business. Last September, the company established the Climate Pledge, aiming to reach its goal of carbon net zero by 2040, a decade ahead of the carbon reduction goals set forth by the Paris Climate Agreement.In a statement Tuesday, Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said the money would from the fund would go to \u201cvisionary entrepreneurs and innovators\u201d helping companies reduce their carbon footprints.\u201cCompanies from around the world of all sizes and stages will be considered, from pre-product startups to well-established enterprises,\u201d Bezos said. \u201cEach prospective investment will be judged on its potential to accelerate the path to zero carbon and help protect the planet for future generations.\u201dJust last week, Amazon announced Verizon Communications (VZ), the parent company of Yahoo Finance, Infosys (INFY), and Reckitt Benckiser Group (RBGLY) will also be joining the Climate Pledge.Amazon\u2019s latest sustainability report highlights the challenges the company faces, juggling sustainability with global growth. While the company\u2019s carbon intensity, the amount of carbon emitted per unit of energy consumed, dropped 5% in the last year, Amazon still increased its carbon footprint by 15% in 2019. That came on the back of net sales that increased 22%.Story continues\u201cThat\u2019s a good early indication. As we\u2019re growing as a business, we\u2019re still decarbonizing while we grow,\u201d Hurst said.Amazon has already announced 91 renewable energy projects around the world, putting the company on path to run on 100% renewable energy by 2025, five years ahead of its 2030 target. It has also set out to slash the carbon footprint for its shipments by 50% in that timeframe. Hurst said the company\u2019s sustainability efforts have eliminated 33% of waste out of Amazon packaging since 2015, through its program Frustration Free Packaging, eliminating the use of 1.5 billion boxes.Rows of Amazon Prime delivery vans are stored in the lots at the Cox Automotive Inc.

The corporation announced earlier this week it will furlough hundreds of workers here and more at it's other locations around the country due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

We\u2019ve expanded that and really driven in what we call ship in own container, when we don\u2019t put an Amazon overbox over a product so it might come to you with just a label on it,\u201d Hurst said.Concerns about environmental waste have only grown amid the COVID-19 pandemic and stay-at-home measures that led to a surge in online sales and deliveries. In March alone, the heigh of the pandemic in the U.S., Amazon\u2019s website saw 2.5 billion visitors, a 65% jump from the same period last year, according to online research company Comscore. Revenue in the first-quarter jumped 26%.Amazon has faced increasing pressure from employees to set more aggressive targets on climate. Earlier this year, more than 350 employees, part of Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, violated their communications policy to raise concerns about the company\u2019s business with oil and gas companies.Hurst said the company aims to reach carbon neutral by 2040, in part through carbon offsets.\u201cWe don\u2019t see this as an \u2018either or situation,\u2019 but a \u2018both and,\u2019\u201d Hurst said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a number on exactly what we think we\u2019ll need over the next 20 years, but we\u2019ll focus primarily right now and for the short term on decarbonizing our own company.\u201dAkiko Fujita is an anchor and reporter for Yahoo Finance.
