In return, Delta agreed not to furlough employees, if necessary, until October 1.Delta says it had $15.7 billion in liquidity at the end of Q2, with an option to borrow an additional $4.6 billion from U.S. taxpayers.However, the air carrier posted total adjusted revenue of $1.2 billion, representing a staggering 91% dive from the comparable year-ago period, as Delta was forced to shave capacity by 85%. Even still, the company intends to join other air carriers by spending more on anti-coronavirus cleaning protocols.Meanwhile, passenger traffic was down 93% in Q2 versus the comparable year-ago period. As a result, Delta intends to retire its fleet of MD 88, MD 90, 777 and 737-700 aircraft.The airline cut its total operating expenses by $5.5 billion during the quarter, as more than 40,000 employees took voluntary leaves of absence protected by the CARES act deal. Delta also parked more than 700 aircraft, which helped it cut its average daily cash burn from $100 million to $43 million. In June it fell to $27 million.Story continuesAirline recovery slowing downLike other major air carriers, Delta has resorted to extraordinary measures in order to survive coronavirus lockdowns. Last week, United Airlines scaled back plans to add 25,000 flights to its schedule by the end of August. United (UAL) also warned it may have to lay off upto 36,000 employees.Bastian told Yahoo Finance last month it planned to add just 1000 flights by the end of August, and would do all it could to avoid layoffs, adding that the \u201ctelltale sign\u201d will arrive on October 1.\u201cThat's when the restrictions around furloughs will come off and my goal, at Delta, is to avoid furloughs in any way we possibly can,\u201d Bastian said.Passenger traffic at the nation's airports continued to improve last week, but the TSA says that improvement grew at a slower pace, 8%, than the prior two weeks when it grew 12%. Overall traffic through TSA checkpoints was down 73% year over year.Meanwhile, a resurgence in coronavirus infections hasn\u2019t helped at all. Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth told clients in her most recent note that slowing demand \u201cis indicative of...recent upticks of COVID-19 in select states.\u201dBastian reiterated his warning that Delta will be a smaller airline post-pandemic. \u201cGiven the combined effects of the pandemic and associated financial impact on the global economy, we continue to believe that it will be more than two years before we see a sustainable recovery.\u201dThe company\u2019s stock has been more than halved over the last year.
