Arizona on Wednesday saw another 1,795 positive cases after adding a record 3,591 on Tuesday. In Texas, Houston Mayor Sylvestor Turner said that the city\u2019s intensive care units were at 97% of capacity, according to a Twitter post from a Houston city councilwoman.Meanwhile, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced Wednesday that travelers to New York, New Jersey and Connecticut coming from Covid-19 hot spots would be subject to a 14-day quarantine.\u201cThe latest coronavirus news is not positive for the stock market which was betting the worst of the pandemic recession was behind us,\u201d Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist for MUFG Union Bank, said in an email. \u201cAll the hopes of investors looking for a better economy to improve the bottom lines of companies shut down in the recession have been dashed. Forget about the fears of the virus coming back in the fall, the number of new cases and hospitalizations in states like Arizona, Texas, and Florida says the threat is happening right now.\u201dThe increases in new cases also came in states that comprise major portions of overall economic activity to the country, based on gross domestic product (GDP). Neil Dutta, head of economic research at Renaissance Macro Research, pointed out in a note Wednesday that California, Texas, Arizona and Florida together contribute 30.3% of US GDP.Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said during an appearance before the House Energy and Commerce Committee Tuesday that the \u201cnext couple of weeks are going to be critical\u201d in containing the virus in states in the South and West where surges have appeared.Story continuesStill, state and local officials have so far largely tabled the idea of shutting down their state economies again, with Texas Gov. Greg Abott saying that a new lockdown would be the last option. Fauci also added during his testimony that states might not require going back into \u201can absolute lockdown\u201d to contend with the latest rise in cases.Despite the uncertainty around the virus, stocks still closed higher at the end of the regular session Tuesday, helped in part by optimism over a coronavirus vaccine and some improving economic data. And investors have continued to bet on increased stimulus from policymakers to boost the economy in the face of the pandemic, with the Washington Post reporting Tuesday that President Donald Trump supported another round of direct checks to taxpayers.Still, concerns over the trajectory of economic activity have mounted as the coronavirus pandemic continues. The International Monetary Fund on Wednesday downgraded its global growth forecast for 2020 to -4.9% from -3.0% in April, marking the institution\u2019s lowest estimate in the history of is forecasts.\u20144:02 p.m. ET: Dow drops 708 points after California, Florida report daily records for virus casesHere were the main moves in markets as of 4:02 p.m. ET:S&P 500 (^GSPC): -80.83 (-2.58%) to 3,050.46Dow (^DJI): -709.06 (-2.71%) to 25,447.04Nasdaq (^IXIC): -222.20 (-2.19%) to 9,909.17Crude (CL=F): -$2.53 (-6.27%) to $37.84 a barrelGold (GC=F): -$7.70 (-0.43%) to $1,774.30 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): -2.5 bps to yield 0.6840%\u20143:24 p.m. ET: Apple adds Houston to list of cities with renewed store closures following coronavirus spikeApple (AAPL) said on Wednesday it is re-closing seven stores in Houston, Texas due to the city\u2019s recent jump in coronavirus cases.

While analysts believe hospitalizations and deaths are the best metric for judging the path to a recovery, growing COVID-19 diagnoses is underscoring how the world\u2019s largest economy has failed to control the outbreak \u2014 and a rally that some think has defied gravity could be in trouble.\u20149:31 a.m. ET: Stocks open lowerHere were the main moves in markets as of 9:31 a.m. ET:S&P 500 (^GSPC): -22.33 points (-0.71%) to 3,108.96Dow (^DJI): -232.93 points (-0.89%) to 25,923.17Nasdaq (^IXIC): -26.26 points (-0.26%) to 10,104.59Crude (CL=F): -$0.53 (-1.31%) to $39.84 a barrelGold (GC=F): -$8.60 (-0.48%) to $1,773.40 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): +1.1 bps to yield 0.72%\u20149:01 a.m. ET: IMF downgrades global growth expectations, with recovery \u2018projected to be more gradual than previously forecast\u2019The International Monetary Fund (IMF) slashed its expectations for global economic activity this year and said it anticipated negative growth for every global region for the first time in the history of the forecasts.The IMF sees 2020 global economic activity contracting by 4.9%, the institution\u2019s steepest contraction estimate ever. In April, the IMF projected a 3% contraction in global economic activity. US growth is expected to drop by 8.0%, versus the 5.9% drop anticipated as of April\u2019s forecast.\u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a more negative impact on activity in the first half of 2020 than anticipated, and the recovery is projected to be more gradual than previously forecast,\u201d the IMF said in its World Economic Outlook report.\u20147:29 a.m. ET Wednesday: Stock futures dropHere were the main moves in markets as of 7:29 a.m. ET:S&P 500 futures (ES=F): 3,097.5, down 21 points or 0.67%Dow futures (YM=F): 25,809.00, down 211 points, or 0.81%Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): 10,161.00, down 35 points, or 0.34%Crude (CL=F): -$0.82 (-2.03%) to $39.55 a barrelGold (GC=F): +$9.40 (+0.53%) to $1,791.40 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): +0.9 bps to yield 0.719%\u20147:01 a.m. ET Wednesday: Weekly mortgage applications for home purchases fall for the first time in 10 weeksAn index tracking mortgage applications for home purchases dropped by a seasonally adjusted 3% week on week for the period ending June 19, the Mortgage Bankers Association said Wednesday. This marked the first weekly decline after nine consecutive weeks of gains.However, the index was still 18% higher than the same week a year ago on an unadjusted basis.Mortgage applications for refinances fell 12% from the prior week, but held 76% higher than the same week a year ago.\u201cEven with high unemployment and economic uncertainty, the purchase market is strong. Activity has climbed above year-ago levels for five straight weeks and was 18% higher than a year ago last week,\u201d Joel Khan, MBA\u2019s associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting, said in a statement. \u201cOne factor that may potentially crimp growth in the months ahead is that the release of pent-up demand from earlier this spring is clashing with the tight supply of new and existing homes on the market. Additional housing inventory is needed to give buyers more options and to keep home prices from rising too fast.\u201d\u20146:05 p.m. ET Tuesday: Stock futures little changed to slightly lowerHere were the main moves at the start of the overnight session for U.S. equity futures, as of 6:05 p.m. ET:S&P 500 futures (ES=F): 3,116.25, down 2.25 points or 0.07%Dow futures (YM=F): 26,001.00, down 19 points, or 0.07%Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): 10,195.75, down 0.25 points, or 0.00%NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MAY 26: The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) stands in lower Manhattan on the first day that traders are allowed back onto the historic floor of the exchange on May 26, 2020 in New York City.
