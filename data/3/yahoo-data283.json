And as soon as you increase the amount of wood that can catch fire, the fire will come back again.\u201dKass added that in terms of coronavirus, lockdown policies \u201cdecrease the amount of burn that it can go through. And if we keep the virus at a low burn, keep socially distanced and keep people apart enough \u2014 not to stop businesses from moving forward, but to keep the fire from catching \u2014 then we can start to see a sustainable burn that also allows us to exist in a reasonable economy. So please, don\u2019t think this virus has gone anywhere. It hasn\u2019t. We\u2019ve just quieted it down so that we can move forward.\u201dA family enjoys a campfire at the Huttopia Sutton glamping ground in Quebec, Canada, on August 14, 2019.

They didn't have the decreasing number of cases. They didn't have the tracking and tracing in place.\u201dMaking things more difficult, the White House has given conflicting guidance. Vice President Mike Pence reportedly told governors to explain to their citizens that increased testing is why there are more cases of coronavirus popping up.\u201cThe president often talks about embers,\u201d Pence said, according to the New York Times, adding that \u201cdespite a mass increase in testing, we are still averaging roughly 20,000 cases a day, which is significantly down from six weeks ago.\u201dThere are over 2 million coronavirus cases in the U.S. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)And ahead of Trump\u2019s campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, this weekend, Pence claimed that Oklahoma has flattened its curve of coronavirus cases, despite the fact that the state experienced its highest case total this past weekend.Several governors pushed for re-openings, citing the economic impact that shutdowns were having on small businesses. And many of the states\u2019 residents ignored restrictions and reopened anyways.\u201cIf this is how people want to live their lives\u2026 this is the path they're choosing,\u201d Kass said, \u201cwhich is to say that if we are not waiting for the data and we're just opening up because we're tired of this virus, we're going to continue to see spikes and hospitalizations, you know, hit up at a time when we're going to have to somehow react or just let more people get sick and die.\u201dBeachgoers take advantage of the opening of South Beach on June 10, 2020 in Miami Beach, Florida. (Photo by Cliff Hawkins/Getty Images)Why social distancing worksData has shown that social distancing rules and face masks work.According to a study by Nature Research, stay-at-home orders and other shutdowns likely prevented about 60 million coronavirus cases just in the U.S.\u201cIt\u2019s not that the virus is weaker,\u201d Kass said. \u201cIt\u2019s that we\u2019re better at addressing it. Think about the idea of our resources. Part of the reason we stayed home in the first place was not to overwhelm our health care system. It wasn\u2019t to say that we had a fixed number of treatments and we would stop treating people. But we really needed to keep our system going forward.\u201dKass cited an incident at a hair salon in Missouri, in which two hairstylists who were symptomatic exposed 140 people but \u201cnone of whom got sick, because everybody was wearing masks.\u201dOwner of Saint Germain Hair Salon in Washington, DC, Franck Rihouey wears a mask as he trims Joe Poux\u00d5s hair on May 29, 2020. (Photo by JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images)According to medical journal The Lancet, the risk of coronavirus transmission without a mask is 17.4%. When wearing an N95 respirator or face mask, the risk drops to 3.1%.And although many people are relying on vaccine development to bring stability back to society, the earliest that one would be available is likely not until 2021 at the earliest. Even if that\u2019s the case, it would be an extremely quick timeline compared to other vaccines.People wear protective face masks in Murray Hill during the coronavirus pandemic on May 30, 2020 in New York City.

So we need to do things that are smart.\u201d This means wearing masks, washing hands, respecting social distancing, and helping communities move forward in a sustainable manner.\u201cThe optimism is that we know that works,\u201d Kass added. \u201cAnd if we do it, we should be able to move forward consistently. We can open businesses and offices in ways that are socially distant but sustainable if we ask people to wear masks and expect it from them.\u201dAdriana is a reporter and editor covering politics and health care policy for Yahoo Finance.
