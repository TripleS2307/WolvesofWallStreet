Check.-Tabs closed? Check.-All other family members off-line? (\u201cNo, Dad, I have a call!\u201d) Not so check.And then regardless of how successful that process is, my video calls are invariably marked by blurriness, delays, freezing and interrupted audio. It makes me look and sound bad. And unprofessional, which is a problem because like 42% of Americans, I\u2019m working from home these days.A car drives past a sign advertising high-speed internet service near Starkville, Miss. In classrooms, access to laptops and the internet is nearly universal. But many students struggle to keep up from home because of the cost of internet service and gaps in its availability. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)I\u2019m hardly the only person suffering from inadequate internet of course. While the Federal Communications Commission likes to say that 21.3 million Americans, (or 6.5% of the population), don\u2019t have broadband internet, a recent study by Broadband Now shows the actual number is more like 42 million. (Intuitively, that FCC number is low. Just ask yourself how many people you know have issues with broadband.)What exactly constitutes high speed internet these days? Good question. Certainly download speed of 1,000 megabits per second (Mbps)\u2014or a gigabyte\u2014is fast. And according to a story by my former colleague, David Pogue, for CBS News: \u201cThe average download speed today [in the U.S.] is around 133 Mpbs. And what the FCC defines as broadband for downloading is 23 Mbps. It's not very fast.\u201dGot that right David.I have my own definition of high-speed internet though: Two people, (or heaven forbid three), in one household, doing unimpeded video calls simultaneously without having to close tabs and applications. How many Americans have that? Not as many as the FCC thinks. Am I being whiney? No. This isn\u2019t about birthday calls to grandma (although they\u2019re important too), this is about work, school and other critical communication like telemedicine. That\u2019s important.At my house in Georgetown, Maine, (a town coincidently cited in David Pogue\u2019s piece) my ISP, Consolidated Communications, one of the nation\u2019s larger providers with some 4 million customers, delivers to me through copper line DSL, what it says is 15 Mbps down (to the house) and 3 Mbps up (to the network.) But when I do speed tests (just Google speed test and click the blue button) I get 12 down on a good day, and more often 9, and 1 or less up. I should point out that this is when I connect to my router with an ethernet cable. (Remember those?) So, yes I mostly work tethered.Story continues(A side note here: \u2018up,\u2019 didn\u2019t used to be a big deal because generally speaking the largest amounts of data would come \u2018down\u2019 to your house\u2014streaming movies for instance. Video calling during COVID-19 has greatly increased the need for \u2018up\u2019 functionality, which actually first picked up years earlier when people began watching security video of their homes when they were on vacation.)And speaking of COVID-19, that\u2019s what really brought the digital divide, (which of course has always existed), to my attention. And in fact put me on the other side of it.First I left my apartment in New York with its 20 Mbps to 30 Mbps speed (now slower because of everyone WFH in my building), came to Maine in late March and right off embarked on a mad scramble to coax more capacity out of my connection (pleading calls to Consolidated Communications, asking neighbors for pointers, trying out different equipment.) But the real issue wasn\u2019t me per se, it was our team and trying to connect all of them from their different locations. As we began broadcasting live from team members' homes, we quickly realized broadband was our biggest problem.All that opened my eyes, but it was just the beginning.I noticed that I wasn\u2019t the only one with slow broadband up here, when I went by the town hall and saw some kids huddled on the cold pavement near the front door of the office. What were these young people doing? Their homework. The digital divide was staring me right in the face.I also noticed that bad broadband was a normal topic of conversation, like the weather. There were stories of elected officials having to go to neighbors\u2019 homes to use slightly better WiFi for official business. Or a neighbor having to rent an office in town to use the internet. Or a Consolidated Communications employee telling a neighbor there is nothing he can do and the company is based far away and doesn\u2019t care. Or another neighbor who says \u201cthe name \u2018Consolidated Communications\u2019 is because they consolidated all the bad stuff into one place.\u201d (A competitor, Redzone Wireless, has a worse reputation in this town.)But wait there\u2019s more. In late May my younger daughter graduated from college and started her first full-time job. From this house. coordinating internet use became a critical feature of daily life, until she gave up and moved to Boston for a while to try her luck with the WiFi down there. (So much for attracting young people to the state with the oldest population in the U.S.)\u201cThe thing everyone should understand about the current broadband crisis is that it would\u2019ve been fairly normalized usage in a few years anyway,\u201d says Ernesto Falcon, senior legislative counsel at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \u201cCoronavirus increased demand by only 30% or 40%; it\u2019s not like double or triple usage.\u201dBut that acceleration has further exposed the yawning gap. \u201cIt\u2019s a fundamental dividing line of inequality in America,\u201d says Falcon. \u201cYou can\u2019t participate in the economy or society at large without sufficient access.I bet you can guess who\u2019s getting left behind.\u201cIt predominantly hits communities of color and rural communities the hardest,\u201d Falcon says.According to an Alliance for Excellent Education report released in June, some 31% of Black families don\u2019t have high-speed internet. (It\u2019s even worse for Native American families.) Some 44% of households with an income of less than $25,000 don\u2019t have broadband. And the study shows that in over a dozen states including Texas, Indiana and Missouri over 25% of the population has no or slow internet. According to the International Telecommunication Union, the U.S. ranks 24th (after Greece!) in fixed-broadband subscriptions per capita. Again, that means working, studying or seeing a doctor from home is next to impossible.Richest country in the world we\u2019re talking about here.I understand that you may have free market inclinations and I respect that, as in, \u2018If these people want WiFi they should get jobs and work hard to pay for it. Electricity isn\u2019t free in this country either.\u2019 Ah but here\u2019s the difference between electricity\u2014or even water\u2014and broadband. If you can afford some sort of home in America, it often comes with a water hook up and electricity, and if so, it\u2019s the same water (Flint notwithstanding) and electricity that the richest Americans get. With broadband, if you live in a place with underperforming internet, it doesn\u2019t matter what you can afford to pay, there\u2019s nothing you can do. And kids learning from home without fast internet are at a distinct disadvantage versus those living in an area with real broadband.If the Founding Fathers had envisioned the internet, this is not the way they would want it to work.Start treating broadband \u2018the same way we treat any infrastructure\u2019As far as my situation in Maine, I asked Rob Koester, senior vice president of consumer product at Consolidated Communications and he acknowledged the difficulties of serving communities like mine. Yes, COVID-19 has changed the consumption patterns significantly, he said. and it\u2019s tough to really improve service because, \u201cthe ROI just isn\u2019t there,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt can cost $1,000 to $1,500 to bring fiber to a customer\u2019s home and probably double that in rural areas.\u201dAnd I get that. The economics don\u2019t work. Koester told me to mitigate that, Consolidated has been doing public/private partnerships for towns like mine, such as a project he worked on in Chesterfield, New Hampshire, population 3,500, which now has broadband speeds of up to 1,000 Mbps. \u201cThe total cost of the project is $4.3 million, with Consolidated putting up $2.5 million of its own money and the town bonding another $1.8 million,\u201d according to the Brattleboro Reformer.\u201c[The ISPs] are private companies and we recognize that,\u201d says GeDa Jones Herbert, a special counsel focused on education at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which sent a letter calling on 20 internet service providers to address lack of access and affordability among Black students. \u201cIt comes back to the concept of corporate social responsibility. We\u2019re not asking these companies to become nonprofits and throw out their business models. We\u2019re not asking them to pour in endless resources and go out of business. We are asking them, as you\u2019re profiting and we know you are, make a commitment to benefit all.\u201dDitto for millions of Americans living in farm country and on Indian reservations too.Bottom line No. 1: Broadband for all is expensive and complicated to implement. Bottom line No. 2: It\u2019s also absolutely essential and government needs to step up.And prioritize.It\u2019s ironic isn\u2019t it, that politicians are so focused on the foibles of Big Tech, when most of the problems those companies engender are irrelevant to huge swaths of the population. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to focus on things like privacy,\u201d says Katie Jordan, senior policy advisor at the Internet Society, a group that advocates for expanding internet access worldwide. \u201cThe congressional members see issues with tech companies right in front of their eyes. If you\u2019re sitting on Capitol Hill and have access to the internet, maybe every now and then it\u2019s slow, but then you go back to living your entire life online. It\u2019s hard for them to imagine life for someone who hasn't had that access.\u201dBut isn\u2019t that the very core of being a public servant?\u201cWe need to start treating this the same way we treat any infrastructure: water, roads, electricity. Government has to be involved,\u201d says Falcon of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \u201cLots of legacy owners will oppose the transition. But they have to accept the transition has already happened. Most countries, including China, have adopted fiber efforts. We will see the world where average Chinese citizens have a 100 gigabit connection and we\u2019re struggling with one one-thousandth of the speed. It will take years. The longer we wait to start, the more behind we are.\u201dNot surprisingly, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, aren\u2019t waiting. Both have endeavors to beam broadband from a system of satellites that have been greenlit by the FCC, Musk\u2019s is called Starlink from his SpaceX business\u2014which reportedly will offer speeds of some 610 Mbps\u2014while Bezos\u2019 is called Project Kuiper, which is connected to Amazon and not directly to his space company, Blue Origin. Both though are acknowledged to be smaller scale solutions better for rural areas, at least for now.In the meantime, before these two (and the rest of Silicon Valley) completely take over our economy, millions of us could sure use some bipartisan help to get online.
