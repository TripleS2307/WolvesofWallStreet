James arrived at the 15% number because Black Americans make up close to 15% of the U.S. population (or around 50 million Americans).\u201cThe best way to get money into these Black communities is through Black-owned businesses,\u201d she said in a recent interview with Yahoo Finance.Within two weeks, fashion startup Rent the Runway and beauty retailer Sephora committed to the pledge. The 15 Percent Pledge has a three-pronged approach: taking inventory, ownership and action. According to James, if Target (TGT) and Amazon\u2019s Whole Foods and ShopBop (AMZN) join Sephora in this 15% commitment, it could lead to a $15 billion infusion into the Black community via Black-owned businesses.James said she\u2019s been having fruitful conversations with executives at Target, and she\u2019s added a mix of high fashion and big box retailers to her dream list of sign-ons: Net-a-Porter (CFRUY), Walmart (WMT), Barnes & Noble, Home Depot (HD) and Saks Fifth Avenue.\u201cI think people wanted an actual thing they could really do and get behind. There\u2019s been a huge groundswell. We have almost 100,000 people who signed the petition,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are customers at these retailers...who are excited and really wanting and demanding they take the 15 Percent Pledge.\u201dJames said she is working on a seal that businesses could use to denote that they are Black-owned, and added that she is also calling on consumers \u201cto look in our closets, own shelves, own refrigerators and check for Black-owned businesses.\u201dStory continuesAfter posting about the campaign on Instagram, she started meeting with various executives at Sephora, who worked over the weekend to determine whether they could meet the 15% goal.In this Friday, Oct. 23, 2009 photo, shoppers visit a Sephora boutique inside a J.C.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan)Sephora is the \u201cperfect [retailer] to kick this off,\u201d James said, underscoring that it\u2019s \u201cnot just [about] bringing the brands on, but making sure they're [being supported] in a meaningful way.\u201d James said she plans to work with Sephora over the next few years.Scale is criticalThese commitments are symbolic and may be materially impactful, but the issue creates a major hurdle for entrepreneurs to fulfill orders \u2014 even with the promise of a pledge.\u201cThat\u2019s something we really addressed early on with Sephora, and Sephora brought to us as well. It costs a lot of money to be in all the doors of Sephora. So for us, we're really going to have to start also connecting with VCs and making sure that they are looking at the brands that these businesses are trying to scale. That\u2019s absolutely critical,\u201d James noted.Only 1% of venture capital dollars go to Black startup founders. And the number of Black VC dealmakers in 2018 fell to 1%, according to The Information.As a Black entrepreneur who bootstrapped Brother Vellies, James has firsthand experience trying to build a brand from scratch.\u201cI created Brother Vellies with $3,500 dollars at the flea market in the Lower East Side. We\u2019ve gone on to sell millions of dollars of shoes. I\u2019m lucky that has happened, but it\u2019s been without VC support. So I think we also need to start asking ourselves why these VCs aren\u2019t looking at Black-owned businesses and calling for that to change,\u201d she said.Melody Hahm is Yahoo Finance\u2019s West Coast correspondent, covering entrepreneurship, technology and culture.
