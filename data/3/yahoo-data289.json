REUTERS/Mike Segar TPX IMAGES OF THE DAYIn recent days, homelessness and crime have soared, and a number of wealthier residents have fled the city for other locations, particularly as continuing stiff restrictions take a heavy toll on public life.Governor Andrew Cuomo announced on Wednesday that the city would reopen indoor dining at partial capacity, a number of gymnasiums \u2014 which just reopened last week \u2014 are filing suit to allow group classes to resume. It underscored tensions between business owners being deprived of their livelihoods, and public officials moving to prevent more spreading.\u201cDespite New York\u2019s success in containing the coronavirus, unprecedented numbers of New Yorkers are unemployed, facing homelessness, or otherwise at risk,\u201d the letter said.\u201cThere is widespread anxiety over public safety, cleanliness and other quality of life issues that are contributing to deteriorating conditions in commercial districts and neighborhoods across the five boroughs,\u201d it added.In a post on Twitter, de Blasio said his goal was a partnership to \u201crebuild a fairer, better city\u201d \u2014 but put the onus partly on the federal government. On Thursday, a measure to pass a stripped down stimulus bill, which would have included aid to states and localities, faltered in the U.S. Senate. Efforts to forge a consensus have become mired in election year politics and partisan squabbling.Story continues\u201cLet\u2019s be clear: To restore city services and save jobs, we need long term borrowing and a federal stimulus \u2014 we need these leaders to join the fight to move the City forward,\u201d the mayor tweeted.Since the COVID-19 crisis first slammed into the city back in March, and forced widespread business closures, New York has slowly recovered from being a global epicenter of the outbreak.Still, grim headlines about residents fleeing New York have amplified growing concerns about the city\u2019s tax base and finances, while raucous protests in the Big Apple\u2019s formerly bustling streets stoke new fears about its fraying social fabric.Meanwhile, New York City may be forced to lay off tens of thousands of city workers, a microcosm of the nationwide jobless crisis that\u2019s thrown millions out of work. In April, de Blasio warned the city was facing a tax revenue deficit of over $7 billion in the wake of the outbreak.The Partnership\u2019s business leaders called for a \u201ca strong, consistent message that our employees, customers, clients and visitors will be coming back to a safe and healthy work environment. People will be slow to return unless their concerns about security and the livability of our communities are addressed quickly and with respect and fairness for our city\u2019s diverse populations.\u201dJavier David is an editor for Yahoo Finance.
