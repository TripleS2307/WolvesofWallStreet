The near-fourfold increase in Tesla\u2019s stock made it the second-best performer in the Nasdaq 100 after Moderna (MRNA), and rocketed Tesla\u2019s market capitalization to nearly $300 billion to make it the world\u2019s most valuable automaker. Shares of Tesla rose more than 2% in late trading, as of 4:28 p.m. ET.Heading into the report, investors honed in especially on Tesla\u2019s bottom line to see whether the company would eke out a profit based on GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles). The company pulled off a fourth consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability, making the stock eligible to be considered for inclusion in to the S&P 500 \u2013 a milestone which would broaden the pool of potential investors into Tesla\u2019s stock.\u201cOur operating profit improved in Q2 despite challenging circumstances,\u201d Tesla wrote in its earnings release. \u201cPositive impacts included lower operating costs due to a temporary reduction in employee compensation expense, a sequential increase in regulatory credit revenue and deferred revenue recognition of $48M related to a Full Self Driving (FSD) feature release.\u201d\u201cThese positive contributions were offset by significant costs related to factory shutdowns, as well as a sequential increase in non-cash SBC [stock-based compensation] expense primarily attributable to $101M to 2018 CEO award milestones,\u201d Tesla added.Story continuesA Tesla Model 3 car is displayed during the Tesla China-made Model 3 Delivery Ceremony in Shanghai.

However, many investors and individual analysts expected the company would post a profit after Tesla reported better than expected deliveries earlier this month.Tesla said in early July that it delivered 90,650 vehicles in the three months ending in June, after delivering about 88,400 in the first quarter of the year. The sequential increase came even as Tesla grappled with a nearly two-month closure of its factory in Fremont, California \u2013 the company\u2019s only car-making facility in the US. The factory, closed in March as virus-related shutdowns swept California, came back online in mid-May.Despite the temporary pause in US production, Tesla doubled down on its goal of delivering at least 500,000 vehicles this year. Tesla first introduced that target in January this year, saying at the time before the global pandemic that it expected deliveries \u201cshould comfortably exceed 500,000 units.\u201d\u201cWe have the capacity installed to exceed 500,000 vehicle deliveries this year, despite recent production interruptions,\u201d Tesla said in its Wednesday update. \u201cWhile achieving this goal has become more difficult, delivering half a million vehicles in 2020 remains our target.\u201dTesla\u2019s newly ramped facility in Shanghai offered some respite as the pandemic overtook the US during the second quarter. While Tesla did not break out Q2 production or delivery figures by geography, the company. said the Model 3 has \u201creceived a strong reception in China.\u201dTesla added that construction for Model Y lines at the Shanghai factory is \u201cprogressing as planned,\u201d and first deliveries are expected in 2021.This post is breaking.
