Earlier this week, markets sold off after White House Trade Adviser Peter Navarro told Fox News America\u2019s trade deal with China was \u201cover.\u201dNavarro and President Donald Trump have since walked back those comments, but the underlying strains are likely to remain front and center.\u201cTrump is holding on to this Phase One trade deal and it's because he knows what it's going to do to the markets if it blows up,\u201d Ian Bremmer, founder & president of the Eurasia Group told Yahoo Finance\u2019s On the Move.While the president may be holding on to the message the deal is still on, Bremmer warned some in his own circle are not sold.\u201cThe advisors I\u2019ve spoke to in the White House, including some very senior ones, are telling me that on balance, they think the deal will not last through the election. But it's very close,\u201d he added.President Donald Trump, left, meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a meeting on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan, Saturday, June 29, 2019. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)Not Just About TradeBremer is hardly alone in thinking the Sino-American accord is on the ropes. In a research note to clients on Friday, Capital Economics chief U.S. economist Paul Ashworth linked Trump\u2019s waning electoral fortunes to his saber-rattling at China.The president \u201chas taken an increasingly belligerent stance toward China in his recent public appearances, albeit aimed mostly at China\u2019s coronavirus response rather than trade relations. The further behind in the polls he falls, the more he is likely to fall back on bashing China to shore up his support,\u201d Ashworth wrote.\u201cThe upshot is that we doubt the Phase One trade deal will survive intact until the election in November,\u201d he said, adding that the chances of China fulfilling its own obligations under the accord are \u201cclose to zero now.\u201dStory continuesAccording to Ashworth, \u201cat some point it will be too tempting for Trump to try and boost his support by unilaterally withdrawing. Whether Trump would impose additional tariffs is unclear, however.\u201dEurasia\u2019s Bremmer told Yahoo Finance that a host of factors other than COVID-19 and trade are making U.S. China relations \u201cworse on almost every front.\u201dFrom the South China Sea to Taiwan and Hong Kong, fights between the two superpowers are breaking out on almost every front, Bremmer noted. \u201cYou cannot look at an issue between the US and China right now that is moving in a good direction there.\u201dThe rising Tensions will also likely be at the front of voter\u2019s minds when they head to the polls in November, something Bremmer says the President is very aware of.\u201cTrump clearly understands that a hard line on China is particularly useful to distract from his own missteps around coronavirus. And blaming the Chinese and even using racist terminology for Coronavirus itself is part of that strategy. He knows what he's doing,\u201d the analyst added.Kenneth Underwood is a senior producer for Yahoo Finance.
