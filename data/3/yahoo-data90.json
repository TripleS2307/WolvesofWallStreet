In fact, he has tweeted about the market more in the last year than during any stretch of his presidency.On Monday, as stocks reversed some of the losses from last week, he tweeted \u201cup BIG today.\u201d On Tuesday, during a Fox news appearance, he promised \u201canother good day today.\u201dTrump weighs in on the market frequently, but he prefers to do it when stocks are rallying, and especially when they\u2019re in record territory. But he\u2019ll also mention the market when stocks are falling \u2013 usually to assign blame for any downturn to his political enemies.New Stock Market high! I will never get bored of telling you that \u2013 and we will never get tired of winning!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 16, 2019Using the helpful Trump Twitter Archive, Yahoo Finance isolated over 200 stock market tweets sent by the president since he took office. These are messages that mention stocks or 401(k) accounts specifically. Tweets just about the economy and his economic record were not included.This narrow universe of tweets \u2013 within the 22,500+ he has sent since Inauguration Day \u2013 provides a window into how Trump approaches an issue which advisors reportedly say the president views as both the most important barometer of the economy and central to his re-election campaign.David Foster/Yahoo FinanceTellingly, over half of Trump\u2019s stock market tweets have come in just the last 15 months.Who gets blamed on the down daysTrump has a range of villains at the ready for days when the market is in the red. The media is a favorite target. Earlier this month he blamed Fox New polls \u2013 which had just showed him down in the key states of Wisconsin, Arizona, and North Carolina \u2013 as the reason for the decline.On Labor Day, after the market had fallen hard for two straight days, Trump promised big returns ahead as \u201cwe\u2019re, hopefully, rounding the final turn in the pandemic.\u201dStory continuesDo you notice that any time Fake News Suppression Polls are put out, like @FoxNews, the Stock Market goes DOWN. We are going to WIN!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 3, 2020Over the course of his presidency he\u2019s also blamed other parts of the media like cable news channels and correspondent Brian Ross, formerly of ABC news, for a down market.The Democrats \u2013 and specifically their impeachment efforts \u2013 have been another favorite target. The market was riding high last December before the emergence of the coronavirus and the president claimed \u2013 without evidence \u2013 that the market would be \u201ceven better\u201d if it wasn\u2019t for the \u201cthe horror show that is the Radical Left.\u201dThe Federal Reserve has historically been the third main target. Trump repeatedly criticized the central bank in 2019 for raising interest rates and, in his view, holding back the stock market.If the Fed would cut, we would have one of the biggest Stock Market increases in a long time. Badly run and weak companies are smartly blaming these small Tariffs instead of themselves for bad management...and who can really blame them for doing that? Excuses!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 30, 2019During this year\u2019s pandemic-induced recession, the Fed has cut interest rates to zero and the president has responded largely with praise for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. \u201cI called up Jerome Powell, and I said, \u2018Jerome, you've done a really good job,\u2019\u201d Trump said in March adding \u201cI'm very happy with the job he did.\u201d\u2018They will make you very poor, FAST!\u2019Since the 2020 presidential race heated up in July, most of the president\u2019s tweets about the market have focused on Joe Biden, whom he calls part of the \u201cradical left.\u201dTrump has repeatedly claimed that his administration is all that\u2019s standing in the way of an epic economic collapse. In a typical recent tweet, the president said that a Biden victory would mean \u201c[m]arkets would crash and cities would burn.\u201dIn fact, the president\u2019s economic fear-mongering has little basis in fact. Recent Democratic and Republican administrations have been good and bad for investors in about equal measure. Biden was also perhaps the most market-friendly candidate to emerge out of the crowded Democratic primary and he has even made significant inroads among Wall Street donors.If you want your 401k\u2019s and Stocks, which are getting close to an all time high (NASDAQ is already there), to disintegrate and disappear, vote for the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats and Corrupt Joe Biden. Massive Tax Hikes - They will make you very poor, FAST!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 6, 2020Trump\u2019s record on the stock market is actually about average and he\u2019s well off the pace of some of his predecessors. Forbes recently ranked modern presidents by stock market performance: Bill Clinton was number one, Barack Obama was second, and Trump was eighth.On the broader economy, Trump has been on the defensive as Democrats now often note that there are fewer jobs in the U.S. today than when he took office in 2017. Biden is also polling close to Trump on who would do a better job on the economy, with some recent polls finding \u201cvoters are split 50-50\u201d.\u2018Stock Market starting to look very good to me!\u2019During his time in office, Trump has publicly forgotten about the stock market for stretches when there\u2019s no good news to report. In the early part of 2018, it appears that nearly 4 months went by without a presidential tweet about the market as S&P 500 returns during that period were decidedly mixed. Once the market got back into record territory, a flurry of tweets followed.It was a bit different in February and March of this year. The S&P 500 dropped over a thousand points as the coronavirus pandemic and recession took hold. As equities dropped off a cliff, Trump tweets became less frequent but they didn\u2019t stop. At one point, he even came close to recommending people buy stocks.The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 24, 2020The market, as it turned out, had a lot further to fall in the weeks that followed, but it has since recovered. During the downward stretch, Trump blamed the media for the falling markets and touted the rare days when the market was up.In recent days, journalist Bob Woodward released tapes withTrump discussing how he intentionally downplayed the crisis despite having evidence to the contrary.\"I wanted to always play it down,\" he said on March 19 as stocks neared their bottom. \"I still like playing it down, because I don't want to create a panic.\"\"He didn't want to cause a panic, Why?\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked Thursday as Washington wrestled with this latest scandal. She quickly followed up with a rhetorical: \u201cbecause of the stock market?\"Ben Werschkul is a producer for Yahoo Finance in Washington, DC.Read more:The US has lost jobs since Trump took office, but so have many other countriesBiden\u2019s top economic priority isn\u2019t what you thinkWhite House on jobs: \u2018The numbers are going to slow\u2019 but we\u2019re in a \u2018durable recovery\u2019Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit."}]}
