Because we're going to be, by the election and the end of the year, we're going to be north of 300,000 deaths, because about 1,000 people are dying a day from this terrible pandemic.\u201dThere are more 6 million confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S. and over 184,000 deaths. Those numbers are expected to keep growing, at least until there is a COVID-19 vaccine widely available.Confirmed coronavirus cases. (David Foster/Yahoo Finance)Saving 70,000 livesA model from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) found that if 95% of people in the U.S. began wearing masks every time they were outside their homes, the number of projected deaths from coronavirus by December would drop 49%. That would save nearly 70,000 lives.Mask use could save 70,000 lives. (Chart: IHME)The lack of a federal mask mandate is one of the criticisms that the Trump administration has received regarding their response to the pandemic as the president largely left it up to the states to decide how to approach the virus. (President Trump has also opted out of wearing a face mask in most public settings.)\u201cI'm a surgeon,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cI wear a mask all the time. And I don't like wearing a mask outside, but we have to do it now. And people are getting tired of it, and when they do, they let their guard down, and that's when people become infected.\u201dCampbell reiterated that the primary issue \u201cis you don't know if you can get a mild case or you're going to get a severe case or you're going to die, and you don't know that. It could be young people. It could be old people. They said first, older people over 65, but now, people are teenagers, younger kids, 20's, 30's, who get the infection and they actually die.\u201dStory continuesPeople protest against mandates to wear masks amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Austin, Texas, U.S., June 28, 2020.

There are reportedly more than 20,000 cases of coronavirus among college students and staff across the country. The University of Iowa alone has over 1,000 confirmed cases.A student walks to her dorm as her belongings are being brought in by professional movers in Medford, MA on Aug. 27, 2020.

Ryan/The Boston Globe via Getty Images)\u201cNow, what has happened is those outbreaks in Arizona and Texas and Iowa over the weekend were 79% of the tests that were done in Iowa, right, were positive,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cNow, when you have, when the virus is going crazy like it is in Iowa right now, right? That's what you got, and that's where we're not even testing enough people. It should be more people we should be testing.\u201dAccording to Campbell, it comes down to three things that have become clear throughout this pandemic.\u201cIt's the masking, the social distancing, we're watching as that actually works,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd what has happened in the country is that at first there was an outbreak in New York and New Jersey and the Northeast and then on the West Coast and then everything got shut down, the numbers went down. But what happened was as the country started opening up, the things started happening and the virus started doing what it does. It spreads.\u201dAdriana is a reporter and editor covering politics and health care policy for Yahoo Finance.
