It\u2019s literally as if Charles Lindbergh had a baby with Joe McCarthy and that baby was Donald Trump and grew up to become the president of the United States.\u201dUS President Donald Trump arrives for the Independence Day events at Mount Rushmore National Memorial in Keystone, South Dakota, July 3, 2020.

We will teach our children to cherish and adore their country so that they can build its future. Together, we will fight for the American Dream, and we will defend, protect, and preserve American way of life, which began in 1492 when Columbus discovered America.\u201dThe message of the Republican PartyMuch of this is due to the sweeping social justice reform taking place across the U.S.Companies have changed their logos, sports teams like the Washington Redskins are seriously considering name changes, and monuments and flags dedicated to Confederate leaders are being removed.\u201cIn every age, there have always been those who seek to lie about the past in order to gain power in the present,\u201d Trump said in his speech. \u201cThose that are lying about our history, those who want us to be ashamed of who we are, are not interested in justice or in healing. Their goal is demolition. Our goal is not to destroy the greatest structure on Earth, what we have built: The United States of America.\u201dStory continuesBut according to Scaramucci, this is not the direction that the Republican Party should be headed, despite most Republican politicians in office still supporting Trump.They name teams out of STRENGTH, not weakness, but now the Washington Redskins & Cleveland Indians, two fabled sports franchises, look like they are going to be changing their names in order to be politically correct. Indians, like Elizabeth Warren, must be very angry right now!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 6, 2020\u201cWhat is the message of the Republican Party?\u201d Scaramucci said. \u201cWhat is the framework? Let\u2019s say I landed from Mars and say \u2018give me a pitch on these two parties. I\u2019m going to join one of them.\u2019 What is the message of the Republican Party today? It\u2019s a very, very dark message.\u201dTrump\u2019s speech also singled out the media, a frequent target of his.\u201cLet me also say a word to those in the media who falsely and consistently label their opponents as racists, who condemn patriotic citizens who offer a clear and truthful defense of American unity,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s what our people are doing. We want a clear and faithful defense of American history and we want unity.\u201dUS President Donald Trump applauds as he attends Independence Day events at Mount Rushmore in Keystone, South Dakota, July 3, 2020. (Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images)His speech was met with applause and praise from some in the Republican Party, while Democrats sharply rebuked it.\u201cThis is the biggest schism in the Republican Party since the Gerry Ford/Ronald Reagan schism,\u201d Scaramucci added. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to defeat Donald Trump to rebirth that party and I hope I can be a part of that over the next four months.\u201d\u2018A systemic danger to society\u2019Part of Trump\u2019s rhetoric could be due to the fact his polling numbers against his Democratic opponent Joe Biden have been decreasing over the last few months. Many have attributed it to his administration\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.And although Trump had been trailing Hillary Clinton prior to his November victory, Scaramucci described it as \u201ca very, very different situation this time.\u201d\u201cPeople are saying like Michael Dukakis, he could come back,\u201d Scaramucci said. \u201cIt\u2019s a potential catch-up situation for him. He did the same thing in the Access Hollywood situation. He was down 13% going into the last month of the election and won the election. I think this is very different. You have 3.5 years of data, you have 130,000 Americans dead from a mishandling of a pandemic. You\u2019ll likely have over 200,000 people, if you look at the modeling, who will have died by November 3rd.\u201dDemocratic presidential candidate, former Vice President Joe Biden holds up a mask as he speaks during a campaign event in Wilmington, Delaware. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)Scaramucci, who has endorsed Biden, will be part of a group campaigning against Trump to explain why he is \u201ca systemic danger to society.\u201d But he still described the current president as \u201clike a prize fighter.\u201d\u201cHe's not somebody you're going to beat in a judge's score card,\u201d Scaramucci said. \u201cYou have to knock him through the ropes into the first or second ring where people are sitting if you want to beat President Trump and that's something we have to work together to do.\u201d\u201cBut if he wins again,\u201d he continued, \u201cit's not clear to me that's good for the markets. There will likely be more racial unrest, more social unrest. He's dividing the country. He's not a person that wants to unite the country. Just look at the rhetoric. He's a red tribal leader.\u201dAdriana is a reporter and editor covering politics and health care policy for Yahoo Finance.
