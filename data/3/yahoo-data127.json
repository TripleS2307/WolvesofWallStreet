But with sellers slow to re-enter the market because of the nationwide lockdowns and demand higher than ever, the U.S. has become an even more competitive market, said Corcoran.\u201cWhen the buyers in many of the states that are restricted are allowed to come out and actually look at houses, they\u2019re going to make a lot of purchases very quickly. So even in states where you have excess inventory, it\u2019s going to be gobbled up,\u201d Corcoran told Yahoo Finance.For the week ending June 13, inventory was down 27% compared to last year, according to Realtor.com. Inventory hit a 25-year low in December 2019, with moderate improvement at the beginning of 2020. But it plunged when the pandemic hit the U.S. in mid-March and sellers pulled their homes off the market, according to an analysis by Odeta Kushi, deputy chief economist for First American Financial Corporation, a a Santa Ana, California-based provider of title insurance, settlement services and risk solutions for real estate transactions.FILE - In this Feb. 26, 2020, file photo, visitors look toward the \"Painted Ladies,\" a row of historical Victorian homes, in front of the San Francisco skyline from Alamo Square Park in San Francisco.

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File)The coronavirus forced Americans to work from home and redefined how Americans see their home. Some Americans are now looking for new homes with bigger yards, home offices and more square footage, after spending months in lockdown. Studies also show that more buyers are now looking to the suburbs for their next home, according to Redfin.\u201cEverybody\u2019s reassessed the concept of home, and what that creates is the desire for change. And when you have change, you have a rising housing market,\u201d said Corcoran.Plus, mortgage rates hit an all-time low this week, incentivizing even more buyers into the market. Mortgage applications hit an 11-year high for the week ending June 12, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.Story continues\u201c[There are] giveaway prices in the mortgage market where money is so cheap it\u2019s almost like you\u2019re embarrassed to say you don\u2019t have a mortgage anymore. There\u2019s so much incentive there,\u201d said Corcoran, who noted that tightened lending restrictions are the one negative.\u2018Explosion of prices\u2019When more people want a product than the market can supply, the price goes up. Home prices already rose to an all-time high before the pandemic, as homes in the U.S. sold for an average $384,900 in the first quarter of 2020 \u2014 well above highs before the Great Recession, which reached an average of $322,100 in its peak, according to the Federal Reserve of St. Louis.With heightened demand, homes in the U.S. could get even more expensive this summer, according to economists.\u201cI think you\u2019re going to see an explosion of prices, really,\u201d said Corcoran. \u201cPrices are going to continue to go up, when the buyers in many of the states that are restricted are allowed to come out and actually look at houses, they\u2019re going to make a lot of purchases very quickly.\u201dSarah Paynter is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
