Furman is a Democrat who was chair of the Council of Economic Advisers. Holtz-Eakin is a Republican who was director of the Congressional Budget Office and chief economic adviser to John McCain during his 2008 presidential campaign.Biden\u2019s alternative business tax would be a new 15% tax on \u201cbook income\u201d for companies with more than $100 million in annual income. Book income is the profit or loss public companies report to shareholders, and it\u2019s often higher than the income they report to the IRS. That\u2019s because public book income doesn\u2019t take into account the many complex tax deductions companies often use to lower their tax bill. Amazon, for instance, reportedly paid no tax in 2018, even though it turned a $10 billion profit.Isn\u2019t it reasonable to make profitable companies pay some minimum amount of tax? Not necessarily. \u201cIt's a terrible idea, for two reasons,\u201d Holtz-Eakin says. \u201cNumber one, you shouldn't have a tax system and an alternative tax system. You should have one tax system that you believe raises revenue in a fair and efficient fashion. The second is, there's a reason there's a difference between taxable income and book income. And a lot of it has to do with the use of legal tax deductions you set up in the first one. It makes no sense whatsoever.\u201dDemocratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden boards his campaign plane at New Castle Airport in New Castle, Del., Thursday, Oct. 8, 2020., en route to Arizona. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)If the Republican economist opposes Biden\u2019t alternative business tax, the Democratic economist must support it, right? Nope. \u201cAlternative minimum taxes are always an admission that your tax system has failed,\u201d Furman says. \u201cI'd always rather fix the tax system as a whole. Better would be, get rid of the loopholes that give rise to the problem in the in the first place.\u201dStory continuesThe most lucrative tax breaks for businesses include depreciation of equipment, tax credits for research and adjustments for income tax paid overseas. Congress established these tax breaks mainly to incentivize things that ought to be good for the economy overall, such as higher spending on equipment and on research that could generate innovation and boost job growth. The 2017 Republican tax cuts enhanced some of these tax breaks, while also cutting the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. There are also tax breaks that benefit specific industries, including many for real-estate developers like Donald Trump.Business taxes way downBusiness taxes have plunged as a source of federal revenue. The post-war high was in 1952, when business taxes generated 32.2% of federal revenue. That fell to 12.5% by 1980, and it\u2019s been under 10% every year since 2016. The 2017 tax cuts lowered corporate tax proceeds to just 6.1% of federal revenue in 2018 and 6.6% in 2019.Biden wants to raise the business tax rate from 21% to 28%, which is plausible. But he seems to have adopted the alternative minimum tax idea from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who proposed it last year during her own presidential campaign. Warren, like Sen. Bernie Sanders, was trying to generate or tap into outrage over flourishing businesses that aren\u2019t necessarily sharing the wealth with workers. Biden has clearly embraced some liberal ideas to expand his support among the party\u2019s left wing.But if you think companies enjoy too many tax breaks, it\u2019s better to pare down or eliminate the tax breaks than to layer another taxation scheme atop the original one, to capture money that\u2019s legally escaping. Tax experts call this \u201cbroadening the base,\u201d or maximizing the number of entities that pay tax. A simpler tax code with fewer provisions is almost always better than a complex one with various provisions meant to offset each other, because there are fewer loopholes for high-paid tax experts to exploit.There\u2019s no shortage of ideas for making corporate taxes fairer, simpler and more efficient. The Congressional Budget Office regularly publishes a long list of options for cutting spending and increasing revenue, including several possible reforms to the corporate tax code, such as repealing tax breaks for energy companies, ending a tax break related to low-income housing and changing the deductibility of some business expenses. The Brookings Institution published a 352-page paper earlier this year outlining numerous shelters and tax breaks Congress could eliminate to raise more corporate revenue. If Biden wins in November, he could end up pursuing some of those, and perhaps obviate the need to pursue his shakiest tax idea.Rick Newman is the author of four books, including \u201cRebounders: How Winners Pivot from Setback to Success.\u201d Follow him on Twitter: @rickjnewman.
