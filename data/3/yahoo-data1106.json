As part of a coalition called \u201cStop Hate for Profit\u201d organized by the NAACP and the Anti-Defamation League, among others, nearly 100 companies have hit pause on advertising during the month of July \u2014 the latest being Coca-Cola (KO).In an interview with Yahoo Finance, Benioff once again blasted Facebook for being \u201cthe new cigarettes. It\u2019s addictive. It\u2019s not good for you. They are after your kids.\u201d He pointed to Messenger Kids, Facebook\u2019s product for children that functions as a free video and messaging app that can be controlled by parents.The outspoken tech CEO first made the cigarettes comparison at the 2018 World Economic Forum, months before the Cambridge Analytica scandal surfaced.In a statement issued Friday, Facebook defended itself by saying it spends \u201cbillions\u201d on content moderation, and works with experts to promote online safety.\u201cWe know we have more work to do, and we\u2019ll continue to work with civil rights groups...and other experts to develop even more tools, technology and policies to continue this fight,\u201d it added.However, Benioff charged that Facebook\u2019s policies imply that \u201ctheir highest values are not truth and trust, that they don\u2019t really care what the quality is of their content on their platform.\u201dHe added: \u201cThat\u2019s amazing to me. And you know, if your company values are not about truth, the highest value and most important thing to you in the business world, is not about trust, I don\u2019t have a lot of time for that. That\u2019s amazing.\u201dFacebook\u2019s ad dollars squeezedFacebook Chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies in front of a projection of a \"Zuck Buck\" at a House Financial Services Committee hearing examining the company's plan to launch a digital currency on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., October 23, 2019. REUTERS/Erin Scott TPX IMAGES OF THE DAYThe \u201cStop Hate for Profit\u201d campaign asked companies to pause advertising, the bulk of Facebook\u2019s revenues, during July, as a way to crack down on the social network\u2019s policies governing hate speech. Among those suggest changes for the social network is automatically removing ads from content labeled as misinformation or hate, and letting advertisers know their ads ran by such content.Story continuesSome big names have come on board, including The North Face, Patagonia, and Yahoo Finance\u2019s parent company Verizon (VZ), all hitting pause on advertising next month. Late Friday, Coke made the decision to suspend all social media ad spending for at least 30 days, pending a wider strategy review.\u201cSo this is a moment in time where all of us have to ask that question for our companies. Number one, what are our most important values? What are the values?\u201d Benioff told Yahoo Finance.\u201cBut when we look at a company like Facebook or other social media, where we\u2019re getting news and information, and it might not be accurate, or we might be being misled, or there might be misinformation... we\u2019ve got to come back to truth and trust,\u201d the billionaire added.Benioff and his wife also own Time magazine, which he purchased in 2018. He emphasized that news publishers and social media have a responsibility to give the public \u201ctrue information\u201d \u2014 especially with a pandemic roiling society.\u201cOtherwise, you\u2019re going to end up with more sick people, who wants that?\u201dJulia La Roche is a Correspondent at Yahoo Finance.
