(PHOTO: Paul Hennessy/NurPhoto via Getty Images)Negotiations related to a new coronavirus stimulus bill are stalled after President Trump attempted to address the situation with an executive order and three memos signed on Saturday.\u201cI got an email last night \u2014 I get one almost every day \u2014 with a teacher,\u201d Pringle said, \u201cand you can feel the tears in their eyes when they\u2019re writing it to you\u2026 all saying, I cannot put my students in this place, where they are unsafe, and I feel unsafe as well.\u201d\u2018Throwing our schools and our families into chaos\u2019The CARES Act, passed in March, allocated schools around $17 billion through three main funds: The Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund (ESSER), the Governors Emergency Education Relief Fund, and the Education Stabilization Fund Discretionary Grants.As of August 8, less than 4% of the ESSER funds have been drawn down by states, the Education Department informed Yahoo Finance. And 17% of the governors\u2019 fund, in comparison, has been sent to districts.Part reason for why so much money is being unspent is bureaucracy. Education Week noted that the aid isn\u2019t sent as a check to districts\u2019 bank accounts but instead routed through states, which slows down the process.The U.S. has now passed 5 million coronavirus cases. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)Another issue slowing down the process is a dispute over whether private schools are getting funds meant for public schools.Story continuesIn Indiana, the Office of Management and Budget Director Cris Johnston told WBOI about a third possible reason for the bottleneck: \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to make a big transfer before the end of our fiscal year and then have differing guidance come out from the federal government that said, \u2018No, you can\u2019t use the money this way.\u2019\u201dMoney aside, Pringle noted that many schools have yet to form a coherent strategy to handle re-openings and mitigate transmission of the infectious coronavirus.\u201cIf they do not have infection rates in their communities that are low,\u201d Pringle said, \u201cand have been low for two weeks\u2026 if they don\u2019t have the materials and masks and PPE\u2026 if they cannot socially distance or sanitize or ensure they have a plan when, not if, but when a student gets sick or an educator gets sick\u2026 [reopenings are] throwing our schools and our families into chaos.\u201dAarthi Swaminathan is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering education.
