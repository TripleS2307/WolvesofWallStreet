(USA-HEALTHCARE/TEXAS REUTERS/Jessica Rinaldi)The Kaiser Family Foundation has estimated that at least 27 million Americans so far have lost their employer-sponsored health insurance as a result of layoffs from the coronavirus pandemic.Under the ACA, also known as Obamacare, certain people can enroll in health care coverage after major life events, such as losing a job and therefore losing employer-sponsored health insurance. The enrollment period typically lasts for 60 days after a \u201cqualifying event.\u201d An nationwide SEP would open that to all Americans.\u201cWith the knowledge that people had in November or December when open enrollment was taking place, they might have said, \u2018Well, I\u2019m healthy. I\u2019m not at risk. I can\u2019t afford insurance anyway,\u2019\u201d Cox said. \u201cSo their decision was to go without health insurance then, but obviously a couple of months later, the world changed around them very quickly.\u201dCoronavirus cases are increasing in the Sun Belt region. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)\u2018Millions of individuals are at risk of not being able to afford health care\u2019In an open letter to Congress on June 17, several CEOs and health care experts such as Andy Slavitt, the former acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, a former health care adviser under the Obama administration, called on Congress to open a one-time nationwide SEP.Story continues\u201cWe are calling on you to use this existing system to support millions of Americans who need it now,\u201d they wrote. \u201cUnfortunately, current requirements to qualify for existing SEPs create friction that gets in the way of Americans enrolling in new coverage or coverage for the first time \u2014 you have the power to remove it.\u201dPresident Trump has the authority to declare an SEP in states that have a federally-run Obamacare marketplace, which is all but 12 states \u2014 California, Colorado, Connecticut, D.C., Idaho, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington \u2014 and Washington D.C.U.S. President Donald Trump participates in a coronavirus briefing with health insurers in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, U.S., March 10, 2020. REUTERS/Leah Millis TPX IMAGES OF THE DAYIn March, the Trump administration decided against creating a nationwide SEP, instead promising a \u201ccash payment\u201d to hospitals that treated uninsured patients for coronavirus. But this doesn\u2019t extend to individuals who need health care for other issues and don\u2019t have the insurance to cover it.\u201cWith over 40 million Americans now likely unemployed and nearly 30 million Americans already uninsured headed into this pandemic,\u201d the letter stated, \u201cmillions of individuals are at risk of not being able to afford health care in the time they need it most.\u201dThe case for and against an SEPBoth Cox and the group who wrote the letter to Congress argued that the 60 days \u2014 the length of special enrollment periods for individuals with qualifying events \u2014 isn\u2019t enough time to sign up.\u201cHaving a broader special enrollment period that just anyone who wants to come in and qualifies can come in would make it so that there\u2019s less paperwork and fewer hurdles to go through in order to get coverage,\u201d Cox said. \u201cSome of those hurdles can be paperwork. If you\u2019re going through one of the more traditional special enrollment opportunities, you would have to demonstrate your job loss or demonstrate your coverage loss or demonstrate your move, which might be difficult for people who are going through a lot of changes in such a chaotic time right now.\u201dJustin Huang helps a client sign up for a health insurance program under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in the Chinatown neighborhood in Chicago, Illinois. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The open letter asked Congress to ensure that there be an SEP that lasts at least eight weeks, \u201cif not through the end of the calendar year,\u201d remove qualifying event documentation so that Americans can easily and quickly apply, and use existing Obamacare technology so that they don\u2019t have to wait to get their coverage.Critics of a nationwide SEP noted that enrollment periods are limited to specific times of the year in order to disincentivize people from waiting until they get sick to sign up for coverage.Cox argued that an SEP is also \u201cfor the people who aren\u2019t losing their jobs, who made a decision not to get health insurance before, that they should be able to reconsider that decision now.\u201dA man looks over the Affordable Care Act (commonly known as Obamacare) signup page on the HealthCare.gov website in New York. (REUTERS/Mike Segar)The letter to Congress noted that no one can enroll in coverage until the next open enrollment period, which is in November 2020, and the coverage wouldn\u2019t go into effect until January 2021. A nationwide SEP would make insurance available as the coronavirus pandemic worsens in the U.S.\u201cWe urge the White House and Congress to use existing government systems and simply open up enrollment to any American who needs coverage now,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThere is only upside for our country, its citizens, and the health of our nation.\u201dAdriana is a reporter and editor covering politics and health care policy for Yahoo Finance.
