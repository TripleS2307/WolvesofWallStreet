Growth accelerated into August, with sales up approximately 20% for the first three weeks of the third quarter.Hormel\u2019s fiscal third-quarter net sales of $2.38 billion represented a quarterly record, as ongoing strength in its retail business was supplemented by a pick-up in its foodservice business as restaurants and other businesses reopened.

He added, however, that \u201cthe magnitude of additional recovery in the foodservice industry, the performance of the entire food supply chain and the state of the broader economy remain highly uncertain.\"JM Smucker posted top- and bottom-line results that also topped expectations, with adjusted earnigs of $2.37 per share well above the $1.68 expected.
