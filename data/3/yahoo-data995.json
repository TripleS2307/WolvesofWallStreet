I do think it's the beginning of a turning point. And the question will be, can we sustain this effort over time?\u201dThe top Obama official says that the protests and demonstrations have been \u201cincredibly positive,\u201d with people of all races, backgrounds, and ages participating.\u201cI also think that those demonstrations have yielded results right away,\u201d she said, citing the appointment of Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison to the George Floyd case and the increased severity of charges against the officers.\u201cThat's the kind of swiftness that I think people know resulted from the pressure. We've seen cities around the country already ban the chokehold, states do the same. The federal government is looking at a bipartisan bill at police reform -- something you would not have imagined six months ago.\u201d\u201cSo I think those positive changes have actually encouraged protesters to continue this effort, recognizing that their pressure is yielding results.\u201d\u2018Patterns and practices\u2019 of discriminationIn the Obama administration, Jarrett also served as the president\u2019s point person in the White House on criminal justice reform, including police reform efforts.She explained that law enforcement changes at police departments around the country will need to come primarily from local governments themselves.Michelle Artiaga of Los Angeles takes a picture of herself on Hollywood Blvd. a day after a large protest march there, Monday, June 15, 2020, in Los Angeles.

(AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)\u201cThe federal justice department could do more to both support reforms within local law enforcement agencies and also look at whether there are patterns and practices of discrimination, as they did in the justice department of President Obama during his administration,\u201d she explained.Story continues\u201cAnd if there are patterns and practices, then take those agencies to court, have a court order supervise how those reforms are done.\u201dJarrett described these moves as \u201ccarrots and sticks,\u201d referring to both rewards and punishments that could be \u201cprovided at the federal level.\u201dIn her role, Jarrett helped craft the White House\u2019s initiatives on criminal justice reform, including increased commutations of sentences for people jailed for drug offenses, as well as moves to reduce mass incarceration and \u201cbanning the box,\u201d which helped job applicants with a criminal record gain employment.But despite these moves, Jarrett said she doesn\u2019t support renewed efforts to \u201cdefund police,\u201d and instead called for \u201csmarter funding\u201d of police departments.\u201cIf somebody breaks into your home, you're going to call 9-1-1,\u201d she said. \u201cLet's be smart about this. Let's be thoughtful about it. And let's engage with the community, because what you really want, is an integrity to the system so that the residents buy into it.\u201d\u201cThere are road maps out there, like the 21st century policing task force that was created under President Obama that has been continued under the umbrella of the leadership conference,\u201d she continued.\u201cThese are the steps that make for a stronger bond of trust between police and communities of color.\u201dThough Obama made strides in the areas of criminal justice reform, many have criticized his administration for not doing enough. But Jarrett says the president and his attorneys general had \u201cvery aggressive\u201d agendas.President Barack Obama, joined by Vice President Joe Biden, left, and Senior White House Adviser Valerie Jarrett, right, speaks during a Democratic Governors Association Meeting in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on the White House campus in Washington, Friday, Feb. 19, 2016. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)\u201cI will say, we pushed Congress hard to reform the mandatory minimums for nonviolent drug offenders,\u201d she said.\u201cAnd we had 80 votes, which, again, is unprecedented to see the Senate come up with that kind of a coalition. One person, Mitch McConnell... refused to bring it to a vote. So I think we could have gotten more done if we had simply been able to move the agenda forward.\u201dDisputing TrumpJarrett had harsh words for President Trump, calling his assertion that he\u2019s \u201cdone more for black people\u201d than any other president a \u201cridiculous statement.\u201d\u201cThe unemployment rate for the African-American community started coming down as a result of the steps that President Obama did to right our economy back in 2009,\u201d she said. \u201cPresident Trump has benefited from those steps and created the spur that got our economy going in the right direction.\u201d\u201cAnd the health disparities, which were intended to be addressed under the Affordable Care Act, he has been in court trying to repeal.\u201d\u201cSo you look at the economic indicators, if you look at the health imperative, if you look at the language that he uses\u2026 I can't imagine why he would think anyone would believe what he is saying,\u201d said Jarrett. \u201cAnd if you look at the polling in terms of his standing in the African-American community, that speaks for itself as well.\u201dKristin Myers is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
