All Americans have a responsibility to protect themselves, their families, and their communities,\u201d CDC director Robert Redfield said in a statement last week.As mask-wearing has become politicized and transmission continues, several states have been seeing spikes in coronavirus cases and have had to reverse reopening orders.In the absence of a unified government ruling of mask-wearing, many retailers and big businesses are taking it upon themselves to keep their employees and customers safe and requiring people wear face coverings in-store, regardless of whether local regulations do so.After Walmart, Target, and others announced the requirement recently, many others have followed.People wearing facemasks sit outside a Walmart store in Washington, DC on July 15, 2020.
