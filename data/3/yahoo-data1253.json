You wouldn't guess that the Dow is [near] an all-time high.\u201dSince the March 23 low, the Dow has rallied more than 44% even as the coronavirus pandemic has disrupted the economy and businesses, causing tens of millions to file for unemployment. Still, despite the gloomiest predictions, major benchmarks have entered a new bull phase.According to Galloway, \u201cthis index has gone from something that represents America, which it does not, and people will portray it as, as something that's a proxy on the economic well-being of the top 10%,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, it is totally disarticulated from the underlying economy or the health of our nation.\"On Monday after the market close, the index announced plans to retool its portfolio. In the press release, S&P Dow Jones said the changes \"help diversify the index by removing overlap between companies of similar scope and adding new types of businesses that better reflect the American economy.\"The shift was prompted by Apple's (AAPL) recent decision to split its stock by four-for-one Currently, the iPhone maker makes up 12% of the Dow, but the new stocks will help counterbalance Apple\u2019s move, which will cut the index\u2019s tech weighting.Story continuesBut Galloway said the Dow\u2019s move was \u201cmore spectacle than historic.\u201d He noted that the changes only have an impact on specific companies, because certain funds buy and sell names based on inclusion in the Dow or other indices.\"Long term, I don't think it's much of an impact on the companies themselves or the markets,\" he added.Julia La Roche is a Correspondent for Yahoo Finance.
