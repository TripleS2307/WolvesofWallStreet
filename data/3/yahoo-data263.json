But if successful, Moderna\u2019s candidate would be the first product the company gets to market, as well as the first vaccine using its proprietary mRNA technology.And company officials on Wednesday voiced optimism about some level of dampening the effects of the virus, especially as new diagnoses soar worldwide \u2014 and continues unchecked in the United States.The final phase of the trials, set to begin July 27, will better inform on the vaccine\u2019s effectiveness.CEO Stephane Bancel told analysts on a call Wednesday that discussions have only just begun of how the vaccine is likely to be distributed. Via Operation Warp Speed, U.S. officials have set an ambitious timeline to begin production on a candidate this year.While no specifics were given, Bancel said the federal government would be in charge. \u201cWe see partnering with government as very important...it's not up to private company to make that decision,\u201d he added.Coronavirus cases are continuing to rise outside of New York. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)The biotech\u2019s stock has skyrocketed since late February, when its partnership with the National Institute of Health began to test a vaccine candidate. The company hit a record high of $88 per share, surpassing the May 18 high, $87 per share, when Moderna announced positive interim results for the phase 1 trial.Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said the U.S. is likely to have a vaccine ready for distribution this year. Meanwhile, officials at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recently said they are confident a vaccine will be ready by winter, if not sooner.Story continuesThe optimism spurred by Moderna\u2019s news comes as the global pandemic continues to hamper the economic recovery in the U.S. The country has now topped 3.4 million cases, while global cases climb past 13.3 million.A surge in the Sun Belt has made America a global epicenter, with states like Arizona, Texas, Florida and California facing strains on health systems and relentlessly surging in case counts. In San Antonio, freezer trucks are lining up to hold bodies of the dead, as the hospitals run out of room\u2014raising the spectre of New York City\u2019s struggles, as it faced a similarly grim phase during the peak of its outbreak.The political class is increasingly falling victim to the virus, with Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt announcing he tested positive for the virus, following last week\u2019s disclosure from Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms.CDC chief backs masksMeanwhile, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Robert Redfield twaded into the growing domestic political debate over public masking. Redfield endorsed what many experts have already advocated for months \u2014 wearing a mask helps to prevent further spreading.Redfield\u2019s remarks came as Walmart, the country\u2019s largest employer, said it would mandate face coverings for employees and customers starting Monday.\u201cWe are not defenseless against COVID-19,\u201d he said, adding that the virus could be under control in two months with universal adoption.\u201cCloth face coverings are one of the most powerful weapons we have to slow and stop the spread of the virus \u2013 particularly when used universally within a community setting. All Americans have a responsibility to protect themselves, their families, and their communities,\u201d Redfield said.His comments come just as the White House has ordered hospitals to bypass the CDC, and instead submit case numbers directly to it, according to new guidance from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).The move has experts worried it could be used for political reasons, a shift away from science-based guidance that the U.S. sorely needs.Yahoo medical contributor Dr. Dara Kass said on Twitter the move is unhelpful to the response.\u201cAs far as I can tell the federal government wants to control the data that tells us how we are doing but not give us the resources to actually do well. Am I missing something?\u201d she said.Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, who served in the Trump administration, also criticized the Trump administration\u2019s move.\u201cThey have the scientific expertise to cull this data in a way that no other agency does,\u201d Gottlieb said of the CDC."}]}
