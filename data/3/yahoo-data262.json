Twitter shut down services to \"verified\" accounts on the platform, which are often high-profile and represent a spam risk. The attack resulted in takeovers of several high-profile accounts, including those of Bill Gates, Democratic candidate Joe Biden, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.Karim Hijazi, CEO of Prevailion, a cybersecurity firm that monitors hacks, told Yahoo Finance that the takeover has serious implications that should concern many in the cyber and intelligence communities.The financial damage was limited \u2013 the scam on Wednesday resulted in at least 12.5 bitcoin being sent to the wallet address shared in the spam tweets, which comes out to about $114,500 at the current bitcoin price \u2014 but it could have been worse.Bill Gates' account was taken over on July 15th. (Screenshot of Twitter from Area 1)\"The amount of damage they could have done could have been dramatic,\" said Hijazi. \u201cI think the greater scenario is what else could they have conceivably done? They could have put out a huge disinformation campaign about organizations, companies, public sector organizations that could have taken a huge tumble. A lot of folks relied on Twitter as a means of understanding where things are at any given moment.\u201dAlex Hamerstone, practice lead at cybersecurity firm TrustedSec, echoed Hijazi. \u201cThis could have been much worse in many ways,\u201d he told Yahoo Finance.A theory that Hijazi and others have is this was just the beginning of something, which could be related to the upcoming election.Story continues\"One of the theories here is that this was a test, not an attack,\u201d he said.The hackers\u2019 coordination with a Twitter employee or insider suggests an especially sinister angle for threats beyond typical methods like spear phishing \u2014 where tailored emails designed to convince someone to give up their credentials \u2014 and exploitations of computer weaknesses.Though some have speculated that it appeared not to be a state actor given the low-level of damage, no details about who perpetrated the attack have been reported.-Ethan Wolff-Mann is a writer at Yahoo Finance focusing on consumer issues, personal finance, retail, airlines, and more.
