The fact that it\u2019s being done at all amid the COVID-19 pandemic that has shut major sports (and bowling alleys across the country) down is impressive.The PBA Tour returned to the TV airwaves in late May with strict social distancing protocols, explains Edison.\u201cWhat you\u2019ll see is between eight and 10 to 12 bowlers total. You\u2019ll never see more than two bowlers on a lane at the same time. There\u2019s no sharing of any resources. Everybody on the set and the crew is wearing masks. Temperature checks are done when you come in. And we\u2019re just taking health and safety really seriously. It\u2019s the number one priority right now,\u201d Edison said on Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade.Also a priority is making the game more entertaining for people to watch at home. Utilizing her background in marketing and entertainment, Edison has unveiled new TV events since the tour\u2019s return such as \u201cStrike Derby\u201d where players race to throw as many strikes as possible in a specified time. Another has been a shootout type of event pitting the sport\u2019s top bowlers \u2014 male and female \u2014 against one another.Edison is also working on an event that utilizes the sports legends such as Walter Ray Williams Jr. (the sport\u2019s Babe Ruth) and the current crop of strike throwers.PORTLAND, ME - MARCH 30: Terrence Robinson of Gray shakes PBA player Walter Ray Williams Jr.'s hand after winning against the pro during the PBA Xtra Frame Maine Shootout at Bayside Bowling in Portland, ME on Monday, March 30, 2015.

Edison was quickly installed as CEO after serving as Bowlero Corp.\u2019s chief customer officer. Media giant Fox expanded its relationship with the Tour in October 2019, giving it prime placement on its sports channel FS1 and Fox. The Fox deal \u2014 and others Edison is working on \u2014 could meaningfully up the prize money for the athletes (who make far less than other sports).Story continues\u201cWe did two special events in June. Over half of those viewers watched it for the first time. So we\u2019re exposing bowling to a new generation, a new audience. That\u2019s really the goal. We have changed a lot. What you\u2019re seeing on TV is that dynamic, sexy version of bowling that has never been around before. Our partners at Fox have been really, really supportive,\u201d Edison says.And as for that high game of 135, Edison is focused on reimagining her game as well.\u201cI\u2019m a recreational bowler. I just got a new ball. I just got new shoes,\u201d she says. I\u2019m hoping to break my high of 135.\u201dBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
