So if you add on capacity restrictions, new safety and service protocols, it's really tough for a restaurant to make it.\u201dOpenTable data, which comes from a fraction of the nearly 60,000 restaurants around the globe, shows a modest recovery for establishments in some U.S. cities as states have allowed restaurants to open dining options. Unsurprisingly, when most of the country initiated lockdowns back in March and April diners plummeted 100% year-over-year, but have since nationally recovered to about only a 65% drop relative to last year.\u201cIf you look at the individual restaurants that are open, they\u2019re filling every table they put out there,\u201d Hafner said.That only makes worrying spikes of coronavirus cases in some parts of the country even more problematic if they threaten more restaurants from either reopening or with seating-capacity limits. In Maine, for example, indoor bars won\u2019t be reopening as quickly as planned. In Louisiana, occupancy limits for many establishments were recently extended. If that trend continues, more restaurants barely staying above water might shutter.Luckily for smaller restaurants, when it comes to support from those patronizing restaurants in their community, diners seem to be favoring local restaurants over big chains, according to Hafner.Story continues\u201cIn general, people are choosing to go to smaller, local restaurants than big chain venues,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we are seeing some shifts there.\u201dZack Guzman is the host of YFi PM as well as a senior writer and on-air reporter covering entrepreneurship, cannabis, startups, and breaking news at Yahoo Finance.
