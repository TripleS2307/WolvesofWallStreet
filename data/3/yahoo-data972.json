But she cautioned that the rebound could prove more difficult than some investors anticipate, even amid apparent progress in the development of a coronavirus vaccine.\u201cThe stock market is factoring in a fairly smooth ride to that recovery,\u201d says Pennington, who leads the financial advisory firm Edward Jones, which serves seven million clients in the U.S. and Canada with $1.3 trillion in assets. \u201cWe don't think it's going to be quite that smooth.\u201d\u201cWe're asking investors and our clients to buckle up a little bit,\u201d she adds. \u201cBe ready for a bit of a bumpy ride.\u201dOptimism about the recovery softened last week when more than one million Americans filed for unemployment benefits, an uptick from the week before and a threshold that analysts expect claims to reach again when figures are released on Thursday.The recovery slowed last month after a record-setting jobs surge in May and June. The unemployment rate fell to 10.2% in July but remained well above the low single-digit marks seen before the pandemic. Meanwhile, Q2 U.S. GDP fell by a staggering 32.9% quarter over quarter, annualized.But Pennington said the strong pre-coronavirus economic performance at the outset of the year gives investors confidence that the U.S. can return to such levels of production soon.\u201cThe stock market looks backwards just a little bit and says, \u2018The economy was pretty strong,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cThe stock market is now looking forward \u2014 the stock market is always forward looking \u2014 to a recovery of the economy.\u201dThe recovery will take hold later this year but won\u2019t ramp up until next year, she said.Story continues\u201cProbably beginning in the fourth quarter, a little bit of it is already begun,\u201d she adds. \u201cThen really picking up speed and 2021.\u201dEdward Jones Managing Partner Penny Pennington appears on \"Influencers with Andy Serwer.\"Pennington spoke to Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer in an episode of \u201cInfluencers with Andy Serwer,\u201d a weekly interview series with leaders in business, politics, and entertainment.Some economic observers have noted that a return to pre-coronavirus levels of production may not be possible until the discovery and distribution of a coronavirus vaccine.There are 32 vaccines currently undergoing human trials, including eight candidates that have entered phase three trials involving thousands of test subjects, the New York Times reports. Last month, pharmaceutical companies Moderna (MRNA) and Pfizer (PFE) announced that each had begun phase three trials on a respective vaccine candidate.In addition to the market\u2019s expectations of an eventual economic recovery, the optimism may spring from apparent progress on coronavirus therapeutics and vaccines, Pennington said.\u201cYou might hypothesize that the stock market is also looking for treatments to COVID, maybe a vaccine,\u201d she says. \u201cI'm hoping that that's not pure hopeful conjecture \u2014 that it actually is on the way.\u201dRead more:Coronavirus vaccine 'possible' by winter: Top Harvard scientistBill Gates: We should be able to \u2018manufacture a lot of vaccines\u2019 next yearJump into stock market expecting rise 'a fool's errand': Billionaire investor David RubensteinMichael Dell: \u2018Not enough\u2019 progress on diversity in the tech industryRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"}]}
