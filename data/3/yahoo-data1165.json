The move followed a three-month industry shutdown that left the majority of workers furloughed or unemployed, and cost the industry billions.\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be returning to normal for a long time,\u201d SAG-AFTRA President Gabrielle Carteris told Yahoo Finance in a recent interview.\u201cPeople have to remember there is no such thing as entering back into work [completely] \u2018safe.\u2019 It will only be \u2018safer\u2019, so we\u2019ve worked with epidemiologists, scientists and the medical professionals to really talk about what that means,\u201d added Carteris, an alumna of the hit 90s drama, \u201cBeverly Hills 90210.\u201dThe key components of the reopening plan will include:Frequent COVID-19 testingClosed sets with no visitorsA 'zone system' to maintain social distancing measuresSanitation and disinfection practicesHollywood is reopening amid the coronavirus \u2014 with strict social distancing guidelines in place.Additionally, sets will have a designated health safety supervisor (and associated department) to take charge of the testing process and coordination.\u201cTesting is paramount for us,\u201d Carteris explained. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for the best test available [to give us] that high-percentage of correct results.\u201dYet, some critics say the plan is not conducive to smaller-budget productions like reality TV and documentaries, which could lack the infrastructure needed for tighter regulation.\u201cI know it\u2019s a challenge [but] they have to be regulated like that,\u201d Carteris said.\u201cMaybe if they are not able to fulfill those interests that are put out by the guidelines, they shouldn\u2019t be opening, but truly, a smaller production is not going to be as challenged because we will be able to work with those,\u201d she added.Carteris went on to explain how larger productions are of greater concern \u2014 noting that the number of background performers will most likely be limited due to \u201cpotential downsides\u201d and safety risks.Story continuesAnd as for those romantic kissing scenes? Well, they might just become a thing of the past. Carteris told Yahoo Finance that on-screen intimacy won\u2019t be \u201cas graphic\u201d as they\u2019ve been in recent years.\u201cI think we\u2019re going to go back in time a little bit to where people are able to use their imagination more,\u201d Carteris predicted.\u201cWe\u2019re going to find innovative ways to tell stories. You\u2019re still going to be gratified by the intimacy that\u2019s going to happen, but it will be shot differently, stories will be told differently,\u201d she continued.\u201cIn the end, we\u2019re storytellers \u2014 and this is an incredible opportunity to actually find different ways to tell [them],\u201d she added.Alexandra is a Producer & Entertainment Correspondent at Yahoo Finance.
