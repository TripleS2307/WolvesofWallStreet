It\u2019s the latest sign that bundling streaming apps with cell service is becoming table stakes for big telecoms.AT&T (T) now includes HBO Max in its Unlimited wireless plans. T-Mobile since 2017 has offered its subscribers \u201cNetflix on us,\u201d and has made the Netflix (NFLX) bundle a central part of its TV advertising. But Verizon has upped the ante by offering the full suite of Disney streaming apps, putting new pressure on the other telecoms to sweeten their bundles. (And AT&T owns HBO Max, so it\u2019s not quite the same as Verizon\u2019s pact with Disney, or T-Mobile\u2019s with Netflix.)NEW YORK CITY, UNITED STATES - 2020/02/20: American multinational telecommunications conglomerate, Verizon store logo seen in Midtown Manhattan.

Disney Chairman Bob Iger said on an earnings call in February that 20% of Disney+ subscribers came from the Verizon bundle\u2014will all of those subscribers stick around when their first free year is up? (Disney said earlier this month that Disney+ now has 60.5 million subscribers.)One obvious exception to the new telecom-streamer marriage is Amazon.You don\u2019t see any cell providers offering Amazon Prime Video for free, and you won\u2019t: Amazon (AMZN) still uses Prime Video to juice subscriptions for Prime (150 million subscribers as of January), and it doesn\u2019t need to give away Prime. The company does offer a Prime Video-only subscription for $9 a month, but doesn\u2019t break out how many subscribers choose that option, and it\u2019s likely negligible, since the appeal of Prime is the free shipping, and Video is viewed as an added bonus to that core Prime product.Story continuesIn a research note on Monday, Needham attempted to estimate the value of Prime and Prime Video, and concluded that Amazon Prime subscriptions are worth $200 billion (or about 13% of Amazon\u2019s total market cap right now), and Prime Video on its own is worth $40 billion (merely 2.6% of Amazon\u2019s market cap). Needham also cites a survey conducted by The Diffusion Group that concluded 80% of Prime subscribers pay for Prime primarily for the free shipping benefit, while just 20% pay for Prime for the media assets, like Prime Video, Twitch, or Amazon Music.Attendees visit the Disney+ streaming service booth at the D23 Expo, billed as the \"largest Disney fan event in the world,\" on August 23, 2019 at the Anaheim Convention Center in Anaheim, California. (ROBYN BECK/AFP via Getty Images)Prime Video has been the No. 2 most popular streaming platform during the pandemic, Needham finds, second only to Netflix. But because Amazon\u2019s own bundle includes so much, it\u2019s hard to compare Prime Video to Netflix, Hulu, Disney+ and the others in an apples-to-apples comparison.Apple, it appears, will soon be a better comparison to Amazon Prime, as Apple is reportedly preparing to offer a bundle that includes its TV, fitness, music, news, and gaming services.Of course, this game is far from winner-take-all: a Verizon Wireless customer who is happy to get the Disney streaming apps might also want Amazon Prime, and might also want some of those Apple services.So the chief question in the streaming wars will soon shift from: \u201cHow many different apps is the American TV viewer willing to pay for?\u201d to \u201cHow many bundles?\u201d\u2014Daniel Roberts is an editor-at-large at Yahoo Finance and closely covers streaming media.
