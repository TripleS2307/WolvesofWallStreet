And in areas where there are hotspots, remote and distance learning might need to be adopted for a certain amount of time.\u201dZais asserted that the \u201cresearch and science continue to suggest that it is safer, healthier, and better for students to be in school full time,\u201d stressing that to the department, \"it's not a matter of if it should be done, but rather how it must be done.\u201dPresident Donald Trump told reporters on Thursday that reopening schools is \u201ccritical to ensuring that parents can go to work and provide for their families.\u201d On Friday, Zais noted: \u201cThe urgency is real.\u201dU.S. President Donald Trump stands next to a U.S. map of reported coronavirus cases as he speaks about the administration's plan for reopening schools.

New York City and the Hawaii Department of Education both opted for a hybrid approach, with both in-person and remote learning.School districts Miami-Dade and Hillsborough, both in Florida, meanwhile, will both offer full in-person learning for all students.\u201cA majority of the nation right now actually has positivity rates that are less than 5%,\u201d which are \u201cnot inconsistent with their guidance,\u201d CDC Director Redfield noted to reporters on Friday.Epidemiologists generally agree that community spread of coronavirus cannot be controlled if the positivity rate of those tested is above 5%. On the call with reporters, CDC officials cited the 5% threshold for schools remaining open in a given locale.Professor Carol Dysinger of New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, conducts her final remote office hour for the graduate school's filmmaking students at her apartment in Brooklyn.

Students between the ages of 2 to 12 returned first, followed by older students.Students have their temperature checked in class at Yio Chu Kang Secondary School, as schools reopen amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Singapore June 2, 2020.

Two, implementation of the necessary safety measures to prevent virus spread in schools including physical distancing, masks, deep cleaning and ventilation. And, three, the resources to make this all happen.\u201dWeingarten continued: \u201cStudents across this country interact with hundreds of adults every day, including their educators, parents, grandparents and other caregivers, and allowing them back in schools to become potential hot spots of virus spread is, at this point, far too great a risk until caseloads go down and serious federal investments in safe and equitable reopening plans are made.\u201d\u2014Aarthi Swaminathan is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering education.
