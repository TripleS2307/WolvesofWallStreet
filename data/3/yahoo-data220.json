On buybacks, the nation\u2019s eight largest banks had previously committed to suspending share buybacks for the first and second quarters.Senior Fed officials said the Fed may consider additional stress tests and could extend the dividend and buyback restrictions depending on how the economy evolves.The Fed will also require the banks to resubmit and update their plans on capital distributions later this year.Fed Governor Lael Brainard was the lone member of the Fed who dissented against the restrictions, arguing that allowing banks to pay dividends at all \u201craises the risk they will need to tighten credit or rebuild capital during the recovery.\u201dFed Vice Chairman of Supervision Randal Quarles, the architect of the supervisory regime, insisted that the central bank could \u201ctake additional policy actions\u201d if needed.In this June 14, 2018, file photo, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell, left, and Vice Chair Randal Quarles listen during an open meeting in Washington. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen, File)V, U, or W?The stress tests, a key supervisory exercise beefed up after the 08-09 crisis, apply a theoretical \u201cadverse scenario\u201d to bank balance sheets to determine if the nation\u2019s largest firms have enough capital to survive a harsh economic downturn.The scenario, however, was announced before the COVID-19 crisis and modeled an unemployment rate spiking to 10% with real GDP falling about 8.5% from its pre-recession peak. Those figures pale in comparison to the 13.3% unemployment rate and likely double-digit GDP contractions inflicted on the U.S. economy by the coronavirus-induced shutdowns.Story continuesThe Fed added a \u201csensitivity\u201d analysis to its stress tests in which the central bank modeled the impact of a V-shaped, U-shaped, or W-shaped recovery with varying peak unemployment rates and peak-to-trough GDP changes.The central bank did not disclose firm-specific details on the scenario runs, but said \u201cseveral\u201d financial institutions would reach minimum capital requirements set by the Fed under U and W-shaped recoveries.The Fed reported that aggregate capital ratios for the industry would fall from 12% in the fourth quarter of 2019 to between 9.5% and 7.7% under the varying scenarios.\u201cThe results of our sensitivity analyses show that our banks can remain strong in the face of even the harshest shocks,\u201d Quarles said in a statement.The last-minute sensitivity analysis did not include planned capital distributions, which the Fed said would have resulted in a reduction in aggregate capital ratios of about 50 basis points.The Fed\u2019s regular stress test, however, did disclose firm-by-firm results and noted that none of the 33 financial institutions tested failed to fall below regulatory minimums set by supervisors.Under a new regulatory regime, the Fed will incorporate this year\u2019s stress tests results into new regulatory minimums using a \u201cstress capital buffer.\u201d Those buffers, which will be firm-calibrated, will be finalized in August.Brian Cheung is a reporter covering the Fed, economics, and banking for Yahoo Finance.
