Tech newcomers Snowflake (SNOW) and JFrog (FROG) also closed lower, amid a flood of initial public offerings (IPO) that traders are snapping up with abandon.The Dow also snapped a 4-day winning streak, reflecting how investors \u2014 who have bid up stocks relentlessly since late spring \u2014 are now rethinking prospects for a sharp economic rebound in the wake of a still raging COVID-19 pandemic and no immediate fiscal boost on the table.Along those lines, another 860,000 workers filed unemployment claims in the latest period, but that figure remained below 1 million for a third straight week. In a partly encouraging sign, continuing claims \u2014 a closely watched metric of the labor market\u2019s health in real time \u2014 fell below 13 million.However, new housing starts fell sharply last month, new data showed, a worrying harbinger that a hot housing market could be cooling despite record low interest rates.On Wednesday, the Fed signaled that near-zero interest rates would remain for at least the next three years, as the US economy continues to face risks around the ongoing pandemic. The Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s newly issued expectation for interest rates to remain near zero until at least the end of 2023.Fed officials upgraded their economic projections for this year, and now anticipate a shallower decline in real GDP and a lower unemployment rate by year-end versus their early-summer projections. Still, officials suggested that the quicker-than-expected early economic recovery could be jeopardized in absence of further fiscal stimulus.Story continues\u201cThe fiscal policy actions that have been taken thus far have made a critical difference to families, businesses, and communities across the country. Even so, the current economic downturn is the most severe in our lifetimes,\u201d Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in remarks Wednesday.\u201cIt will take a while to get back to the levels of economic activity and employment that prevailed at the beginning of this year, and it may take continued support from both monetary and fiscal policy to achieve that,\u201d the central banker added.Prospects of further support from Congress before the November presidential elections remain dim, however, especially after the Senate failed last week to advance another coronavirus relief package.\u201cWith U.S. interest rates locked at record lows for years into the future and the Fed holding back on incremental QE measures, the recovery path from here will depend on vaccine progress, virus dynamics, fiscal support, and presidential election politics,\u201d said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management.\u201cOur base case is continued reopening momentum, widespread vaccine availability by 2Q21, and an eventual compromise deal on US fiscal stimulus. The U.S. presidential contest may kick up some near-term volatility before its eventual resolution,\u201d he added.The expiration of the federal enhanced unemployment benefits has left tens of millions of Americans put out of work during the pandemic without additional support, with the lapse of these benefits expected to weigh on consumer spending and economic activity as a whole. The Commerce Department on Wednesday reported that retail sales growth slowed for a fourth straight month in August.\u20144:03 p.m. ET: Tech selling drags Nasdaq down in worst day in 5 sessions as Dow snaps 4-day winning streakHere were the main moves in markets as of 4:03 p.m. ET:S&P 500 (^GSPC): -28.48 (-0.84%) to 3,357.01Dow (^DJI): -130.40 (-0.47%) to 27,901.98Nasdaq (^IXIC): -140.19 (-1.27%) to 10,910.28Crude (CL=F): +$0.87 (+2.17%) to $41.03 a barrelGold (GC=F): -$15.60 (-0.79%) to $1,954.90 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): -0.3 bps to yield 0.6840%\u20142:05 p.m. ET: Bloomberg says TikTok/Oracle venture plans IPO within a yearReuters and Bloomberg report that the TikTok saga may end with the embattled viral video platform tapping the market in 2021.
