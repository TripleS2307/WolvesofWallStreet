While many economic, legislative, and social proposals have been made to eliminate the gap between white and Black Americans, some say that reparations is the only hope.By 1921, the Greenwood neighborhood of Tulsa, Okla., was a thriving black community. Dubbed the \u201cBlack Wall Street,\u201d the district featured restaurants, hotels, movie theaters, grocery stores, two newspapers, and more.\u201cIt was quite extraordinary,\u201d says folklorist and reparations scholar and author Kirsten Mullen. \u201cThere were probably few places like it in the southwest. It was held up at the time as a star.\u201dThough the name lends itself to a comparison with the street and financial center in New York, Mullen says it does not compare to \u201cthe volume and capitalization\u201d of New York\u2019s Wall Street.What\u2019s more, Greenwood wasn\u2019t the only \u201cBlack Wall Street\u201d in the United States. Black wealth was being created in neighborhoods around the country, in places like Durham, N.C., and Richmond, Va.But it wasn\u2019t long before these thriving black neighborhoods were noticed, and eventually destroyed.The Greenwood MassacreJust under 100 years ago, the Greenwood district was destroyed in an event that has been called the Greenwood massacre.After accusations of a sexual assault on a white woman, Greenwood was attacked. Stores and homes were looted, and hundreds died. The neighborhood was set on fire: from the ground, and from planes dropping incendiary devices from overhead.\u201cIn the wake of the violence, 35 city blocks lay in charred ruins, over 800 people were treated for injuries and contemporary reports of deaths began at 36. Historians now believe as many as 300 people may have died,\u201d states the Tulsa Historical Society and Museum.A memorial to Tulsa's Black Wall Street sits outside the Greenwood Cultural Center on the outskirts of downtown Tulsa, Okla.

(AP Photo/Sue Ogrocki, File)Mullen\u2019s research partner, economist William Darity said there has been a \u201clong American history of denying and destroying\u201d Black wealth.Story continues\u201cThere was a wave of these massacres from late 1800 until the 1940\u2019s,\u201d he explained. \u201cProsperous Black communities were essentially destroyed.\u201d\u201cIn the year 1919 alone, there were upwards of 35 or 36 of these massacres,\u201d he said.No progress madeBut, Darity and Mullen said, the racial wealth gap was already wide prior to the Tulsa massacre, and Black wealth has stayed \u201crelatively flat\u201d since.\u201cThe black curve looks relatively flat, and the white curve skyrockets upwards,\u201d Darity said.\u201cHistorical data reveal that no progress has been made in reducing income and wealth inequalities between black and white households over the past 70 years,\u201d according to a study from Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Examining data from 1949, the Minneapolis Fed found that \u201cincome has grown at a comparable rate for black and white households.\u201dBut, they noted, \u201cthis means that pre-civil rights era disparities have largely persisted.\u201d Over time, the \u201ctypical\u201d black household is \u201cpoorer than 80% of white households,\u201d the authors wrote.This is the result of \u201cthe cumulative effect of government policy in terms of action and inaction. The federal government never intervened to address these white massacres,\u201d said Darity.Simply put, the flatness of black wealth over time \u201cis the result of American public policy,\u201d he said.Darity noted that reliable data on black wealth only extends as far back as 70 years, but points to the Homestead Act of 1862 as the beginning of economic disparity between Blacks and whites in the country.At the end of the Civil War, while freed slaves were denied their promised 40 acres and a mule, he said, whites were given hundreds of acres of free land.Destruction of black wealthOver the course of the next century and a half, black communities were systematically destroyed through massacres or through the policy of urban renewal, that razed communities to make way for highways or luxury buildings and shops.In some instances, Mullen said, these public works projects were never even started.In the late 19th century, \u201cland was a major source of wealth,\u201d Darity said. \u201cParticularly for folks with middle-income status.\u201d By the 20th century that source of wealth changed \u2014 to homeownership.Denied access to land before the turn of the century, Black households were then subject to racist policies of redlining, contract buying, and land devaluation.While not the sole predatory policies that plagued the black community, these real estate-based discriminatory practices robbed and denied Blacks in the country of billions.Redlining ensured that Blacks couldn\u2019t purchase homes in white neighborhoods, systematically denying families mortgages, home insurance, or loans. The practice derived its name from the red line drawn on maps demarcating areas where African Americans lived. Banks would then justify the practice, deeming neighborhoods that had redlined at a \u201chigher risk\u201d for default.Division of opinions in Chicago.

The scam allowed a home seller to deny a buyer ownership of a home until the home was purchased in full. The buyer would first put down a large down payment, and then make high interest monthly payments. But until the home was purchased in full, the seller held the deed and could evict the buyer at any time. The buyer never accumulated equity in their homes, and no laws protected them.Once a home was purchased, many African Americans have found their assets to be routinely undervalued, despite structural characteristics and neighborhood amenities that are comparable to white-owned homes nearby.These practices were deemed illegal and discriminatory over 50 years ago with the Fair Housing Act, but the impact remains today.According to the Joint Economic Committee (JEC), \u201cmuch less than half (42%) of Black families own their homes, compared to almost three-quarters (73%) of White families.\u201dReparationsIn total, these policies over the last century and a half since the Civil War\u2019s end have had the cumulative effect of the depletion of Black wealth.The JEC has noted in their 2020 study that African Americans experience poverty and unemployment rates that are twice that of their white counterparts, lower life expectancies, and have less than one-tenth the median wealth of whites.But how to undo centuries of racist policies designed to prevent African Americans from accumulating wealth?Both Darity and Mullen, authors of the book \u201cFrom Here to Equality: Reparations for Black Americans in the Twenty-First Century,\u201d say that reparations is the only way.Without it, Darity paints a fairly bleak picture on the ability of African Americans to achieve equality. \u201cBlack Americans cannot eliminate the racial wealth gap with their autonomous actions, and with their existing resources,\u201d he said.And as President Trump plans to hold his political rally in Tulsa on June 20, the threads of the Greenwood Massacre carry through today.After Tulsa, \u201cwhatever momentum Black Americans were building that might have contributed to some closure of the wealth gap was immediately demolished,\u201d Darity said.Kristin Myers is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
