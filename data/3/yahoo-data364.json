But I think we\u2019ve made some progress over the last week.\u201d (Earlier on Wednesday, the president urged the Republican Party to \u201cgo for the much higher numbers.\u201d)On Thursday morning, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told Fox News that President Trump was \u201ccertainly willing to embrace the 1.5 trillion-dollar number that was put out in the last day or so.\u201d At another point, Meadows added: \u201cAt least let's use this $1.5 trillion new recommendation as a foundation for new negotiations.\u201dWhite House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows (L) disembarks from Air Force One with U.S. President Donald Trump at Miami International Airport on July 10, 2020 in Miami, Florida.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) \u2014 who was asked by reporters on Thursday about the president\u2019s push for higher numbers \u2014 didn\u2019t say whether he\u2019d support it.The push from the White House, however, may not actually be enough to move negotiations forward.\u201cDespite President Trump\u2019s comments yesterday, Senate Republicans are still not on board with an aid package anywhere near the size of the Problem Solvers\u2019 proposal,\u201d Sarah Binder, a professor of political science at George Washington University and senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, told Yahoo Money. \u201cPresident Trump and the White House would have to get their own party on board to have any realistic chance of pressuring Democratic leaders to further slim down the House-passed HEROES Act.\u201dSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., departs from the Senate Floor after a vote on Wednesday, Sept. 16, 2020.

(Photo By Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)The Democratic plan passed in May \u2014 the HEROES Act \u2014 was initially worth over $3 trillion but was later cut down to $2.2 trillion. The initial proposal Republicans introduced was worth $1 trillion but their more recent proposal \u2014 which was rejected in the Senate \u2014 was worth just $300 billion.Some of the issues with the $1.5 trillion middle-ground proposal may be the $500 billion it suggests allocating to state and local aid \u2014 a provision on which the two parties have previously disagreed on.\u201cWhen we look at state and local aid, that has been a major stumbling block,\u201d Meadows told CNBC on Wednesday. \u201cHopefully, that number is closer to the $250-$300 billion range. Still, at $500 billion, I would say that that is more than what we're seeing in terms of lost revenue.\u201dMeadows added the higher price tag of the middle ground proposal is not a \u201cshow-stopper\u201d and also called for $25 billion in a separate package to help airlines struggling amid the pandemic and resulting recession.Yahoo Money sister site Cashay has a weekly newsletter.Denitsa is a writer for Yahoo Finance and Cashay, a new personal finance website.
