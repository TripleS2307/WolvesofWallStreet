The protections for federally-held student loans were set to expire on September 30, as codified by the CARES Act, and will now extend until December 31, 2020.But that\u2019s not going to be enough, Ben Miller, vice president for postsecondary education at the Center for American Progress, told the House Education and Labor Committee.\u201cThere's little chance the economy will be in strong shape by then,\u201d Miller stated on Friday. \u201cHaving roughly 26 million borrowers all enter repayment during the holidays \u2014 it\u2019s an implementation disaster in the making.\u201dA graduate walks up to receive his diploma from U.S. President Donald Trump at the Hope for Prisoners Graduation Ceremony attended in Las Vegas, Nevada, February 20, 2020. (Photo: REUTERS/ Kevin Lamarque)Instead, Miller suggested \u201can approach that pauses payments for a full year and ties interest restarting to positive economic indicators would be much better.\u201d But it\u2019s unclear what action Congress will take in the new stimulus bill taking shape.In the meantime, borrowers are already seeing some implementation issues.Student loan startup Summer\u2019s co-founder and CEO Will Sealy told Yahoo Finance that he\u2019s seeing borrowers on the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program have difficulties getting their servicer to count the non-payments towards their loan forgiveness program. They\u2019re supposed to make 120 months of on-time payments before they can have the remainder of their loans forgiven.\u201cFedLoan Servicing has told borrowers they will not count payments until the forbearance is over,\u201d Sealy said. \u201cThis could delay that backlog and cause significant processing errors and delays this upcoming January.\u201dFedLoan\u2019s parent company, PHEAA, did not return request for comment.Story continuesDetails still scarce on executive orderThere\u2019s also uncertainty over what exactly the order means. It\u2019s been more than a week since the president told the Education Department to extend the pause, but details are still scare on how exactly the pause will work.For instance, the wording suggests that private student loans are unaffected by the executive action. It\u2019s also unclear if borrowers on PSLF could continue to count these months towards loan forgiveness and whether or not the memo extends the administration\u2019s previous policy of pausing the seizure of wages or tax refunds of Americans who defaulted on their federal student loans.(Graphic: David Foster)The last issue is important as a pause affects many people who are low-income or people of color, Miller asserted, and \u201cnow is not the time to start taking parts of borrowers paychecks.\u201dLoan servicers are standing by to get more details before they take any action, Scott Buchanan, executive director of the Student Loan Servicing alliance, a nonprofit that represents the servicers, told Yahoo Finance.\u201cAs soon as we get official guidance from the Department, we are prepared to move quickly to implement and work with borrowers on any changes,\u201d Buchanan said. \u201cWe expect that guidance very shortly.\u201dThe ED did not respond to a request for comment.And the ED\u2019s response, if it mirrors the executive order exactly, is likely to disappoint those like Miller, who emphasized simply that \u201con the student loan issue the executive order is it best an insufficient step.\u201d\u2014Aarthi is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering education.
