Each step of that process \u2014 starting with deadlocked negotiations \u2014 will require time.Meanwhile, the median decrease in unemployment benefits Americans will now see would range from 52% to 72%, according to an analysis by Evercore ISI provided to Yahoo Money.Unemployed Americans will see a drop in their unemployment benefits between 52% to 72%, according to an analysis by Evercore ISI.

The Democrat-controlled House of Representatives passed the $3 trillion HEROES Act, which would have extended extra UI benefits among other stimulus measures, through the end of the year. The Senate never considered the HEROES Act.Story continuesBy the time Congress actually began negotiating an extension in late July, it was already technically too late. Most states pay those benefits on weeks ending on Saturday or Sunday, so July 25 or July 26 was the last time jobless Americans got the extra $600.\u201cRepublicans just came to the table in the middle to the end of July to start the negotiations,\u201d Ajilore. \u201cThe question is what the Republicans and the White House were doing all the month of June and early July.\u201dYahoo Money sister site Cashay has a weekly newsletter.\u2018Outside of a pandemic, we would give them two years to conform\u2019On July 27, the GOP released a stimulus proposal calling for cutting the extra unemployment benefits to $200 a week through September and then ultimately transitioning to unemployment benefits that replace only 70% of wages.On Thursday, hours before Congress adjourned, Republican senators including Mitt Romney (R-UT) introduced an alternative unemployment benefits legislation allowing states to choose between reducing the unemployment benefits to an 80% wage replacement rate or gradually reducing the extra benefits to each month.Read more: Do you have to pay taxes on unemployment benefits?Carlos Ponce joins other demonstrators participating in a protest asking Senators to support the continuation of unemployment benefits on July 16, 2020 in Miami Springs, Florida. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Both Republican proposals suggest using a different approach to distributing the extra benefits \u2014 based on wage replacement rate \u2014 which would take months to reprogram due to the complexity of how different states calculate unemployment benefits.\u201cOrdinarily if we were to ask states to do something like that, outside of a pandemic, we would give them two years to conform,\u201d Evermore said about the wage replacement approach. \"That's how it usually works.\u201dSome Republican senators and President Donald Trump hinted at a short-term extension of the extra $600, but Democrats rejected that idea. Evermore said the temporary extension wouldn\u2019t have worked anyway.\u201cThe temporary extension that they were talking about,\u201d she noted, \u201cthat wouldn't kick in for a couple of weeks.\u201dDenitsa is a writer for Yahoo Finance and Cashay, a new personal finance website.
