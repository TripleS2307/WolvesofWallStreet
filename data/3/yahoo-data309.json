As of June 10, the Fed has taken on about $5.5 billion in corporate bond ETFs.The Fed plans on supplementing the secondary market purchases with purchases directly from issuers through a Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility, which is not yet live.Both facilities will be supported by $75 billion of equity from the U.S. Treasury, appropriated by Congress\u2019s Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The Fed says the support will allow the central bank to lever up the facility to be as large as $750 billion.The central bank says the tweak will allow the Fed to \u201csupport market liquidity and the availability of credit for large employers.\u201dthe exterior of the federal reserve building in washington, dcThe Fed had announced both facilities in late March to ensure that companies were still able to tap financing markets through the COVID-19 turbulence.The updated term sheet continues to require at least investment-grade ratings on any corporate debt purchased, with a carveout for \u201cfallen angels\u201d that fell to junk level after March 22. Any debt also must have a maturity of five years or less.-Brian Cheung is a reporter covering the Fed, economics, and banking for Yahoo Finance.
