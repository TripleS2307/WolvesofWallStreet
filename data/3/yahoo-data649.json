The picture is bleaker in the United States, where the unemployment rate sits at 11.1% as of June.The OECD, which counts the U.S. as one of its member countries, expects the U.S. unemployment rate to remain high at 10.4% in the fourth quarter of 2020.\u201cAs prospects of quickly finding new work will remain poor for many, some countries should extend unemployment benefit durations to prevent jobseekers from sliding too quickly into much less generous minimum income benefits,\u201d the OECD report reads.The report, describing the jobs crisis as \u201cfar worse than the 2008,\u201d comes as lawmakers in Washington continue to scramble for a \u201cphase 4\u201d package of further fiscal relief. In focus: whether or not Congress should extend the extra $600-per-week unemployment insurance set to expire at the end of this month.Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has argued that the bonus unemployment insurance should be extended if the viral spread will make it unsafe for people to go back to work. But some within the administration, such as Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia, have reportedly expressed disinterest in extending the benefits.Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Secretary-General Angel Gurria speaks during a press conference for the the Fourth 1+6 Roundtable Dialogue at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, Thursday, Nov. 21, 2019.

OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurr\u00eda said the deep unemployment, which has disproportionately affected women, young people, and low-income workers, is at risk of evolving into a \u201cfull-blown social crisis.\u201d\u201cMacroeconomic policies must remain supportive through the crisis to minimize the risk of a prolonged slump and a lost generation of young people whose labor market prospects are durably harmed,\u201d Gurr\u00eda said.Story continuesThe OECD report acknowledges the risks of a second wave and included a \u201cdouble-hit\u201d scenario in its economic forecasts. Under a single wave, the OECD forecasts U.S. real GDP growth of -7.3% in 2020 with a 4.1% rebound in 2021. But in a second wave, the OECD predicts U.S. real GDP growth of -8.5% in 2020 with a muted bounce-back of only 1.9% in 2021.For all OECD countries, the OECD expects a 7.5% contraction in real GDP for 2020 under a single-hit scenario but a 9.3% contraction for 2020 under a second wave.The OECD report said policymakers should target support \u201cwhere it is most needed\u201d and, in other cases, encouraging a return to work where possible. Getting it right could help countries minimize the damage, the OECD said.\u201cGet them wrong, and the consequences will be felt by many people for a long time,\u201d the report reads.Brian Cheung is a reporter covering the Fed, economics, and banking for Yahoo Finance.
