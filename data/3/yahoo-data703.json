We remain focused on serving them well now and expanding our set of global capabilities to serve them well in the future,\u201d he added.During the quarter, Walmart\u2019r revenue rose 5.6%, or $7.4 billion, from the same quarter a year ago \u2014 benefiting from its status as an essential business that remained open during the darkest days of the COVID-19 lockdown.The company\u2019s closely-followed comparable store sales in the U.S. jumped 9.3% in the quarter, \u201cled by strength in general merchandise and food.\u201d Online grocery pickup and delivery \u201ccontinued to experience all-time high sales volumes,\u201d the company said.Comparable sales for food increased high single-digits as shoppers continued to stock up on consumables, household cleaning products, and paper goods.At the end of the quarter, Walmart offered its online grocery pickup service at 3,450 locations and same-day delivery at 2,730 stores.The stimulus effectThe retail giant's strong quarter was led by buying booms in categories like grocery, health/wellness, and general merchandise.Still, there were some pockets of weakness. Walmart pointed out that comparable transactions declined 14% \u2014 impacted by what data analytics firm Placer.ai noted recently was softer store traffic.Story continuesAfter a steep drop in April, Placer.ai data found that Walmart\u2019s in-store traffic rebounded some in May, but dropped sharply in June and July. The firm also noted stiffening \u201ccrossover competition\u201d from retail giants like Dollar General (DG) Lowe\u2019s (LOW) and Home Depot (HD)\u2014 which also reported strong Q2 earnings on Tuesday.\u201cWhile Walmart is still king, the pandemic has given rise to more home improvement shopping and growing dollar store visits, two segments that seem to be taking away visits,\u201d noted Ethan Chernofsky, Placer.ai\u2019s VP of marketing.Yet that impact was more than offset by Walmart\u2019s muscular web sales. Comparable average ticked grew 27% as \u201ccustomers continued to consolidate store stopping trips with larger baskets and shifted more purchases to online.\u201dWalmart also noted that sales, especially in the general merchandise category, were bolstered by government stimulus spending, especially at the start of the quarter. Congress and the White House are currently at odds over a new stimulus package that\u2019s expected to top $1 trillion, and will likely extend additional unemployment benefits.\u201cAs stimulus funds tapered off, sales started to normalize, but July comps still grew more than four percent,\u201d the company wrote.The general merchandise category saw comp sales growth in the mid-teens. Some of the areas where shoppers spent stimulus funds include in-home, electronics, outdoor living/ lawn and garden, and sporting goods.Apparel was also \u201cparticularly strong\u201d in the quarter across ladies, men\u2019s, and children\u2019s with comps posting mid-single-digit percentage growth.Julia La Roche is a Correspondent for Yahoo Finance.
