Online grocery ordering and fulfillment has seen the same trend: Coresight Research in May predicted online grocery sales will surge more than 40% in 2020, after growing 22% in 2019. (Online grocery was already big for Walmart before the pandemic: Walmart U.S. president Greg Foran told Yahoo Finance in June 2019 that online grocery was creating a \u201chalo effect\u201d on the rest of Walmart\u2019s business.)The question now is whether these trends will continue on the same breakneck pace once the pandemic is behind us.Many analysts think it will, including McKinsey retail partner Sajal Kohli, who told Yahoo Finance that BOPIS (buy online, pick up in store) is \u201cexceptionally sticky\u201d and that consumers have \u201cdiscovered this newfound convenience and they will actually stick to curbside.\u201dWhole Foods CEO John Mackey isn\u2019t convinced that will be the case for grocery specifically.\u201cCovid was a tremendous accelerant for online grocery shopping, and people that had never done it before did it for the first time,\u201d Mackey told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday. \u201cI remember people telling me that they were calling up Whole Foods at 2 in the morning so they could get a delivery slot scheduled.\u201dBut once the pandemic is fully behind us (however long that will take), Mackey predicts the surge in online grocery will slow.\u201cI think most people will go back to normal patterns once people feel safe again,\u201d he says. \u201cSome people will opt for convenience, if getting food is merely a transaction for you... but food is different, food is sensual, people like to smell it, taste it, touch it. If you\u2019re a foodie, you don\u2019t want to be just ordering stuff online, you want to go out and have the adventure of shopping for food. Particularly at stores like Whole Foods, where you have a lot of prepared foods and the stores are beautiful and fun. I think a lot more people than maybe in other categories of retail will not stay online. Or they\u2019ll do a hybrid, a combination, they\u2019ll get their commodity items delivered or pick it up, but a lot of the other stuff... if you\u2019re going to shop for fresh produce, and meat, and seafood, people want to select it out themselves. Time will tell, but that\u2019s what I think will happen.\u201dStory continuesPeople wear protective face masks outside of Whole Foods Market at the Hudson Yards as the city continues Phase 4 of re-opening following restrictions imposed to slow the spread of coronavirus on September 1, 2020 in New York City. (Photo by Noam Galai/Getty Images)Mackey is making a broad argument about buying certain groceries in person, but he\u2019s also making a company-specific argument about Whole Foods stores being experiential. It\u2019s the same thesis Apple stores have represented for years: that people like going to certain stores rather than shopping online because of the store designs. But ever since Amazon (AMZN) bought Whole Foods in 2017, shoppers have noted the gradual Amazonification of Whole Foods stores, through shelving organization, register promotions for Amazon Prime memberships, and even Amazon Echo devices for sale in markets. Some analysts believe that in the years to come, Whole Foods stores could begin to look more like Amazon warehouses.Mackey also says the slow reopening of Whole Foods hot bars (some of which did huge volume in normal times) will further boost sales and shift shoppers away from online ordering.In mid-March, \u201cWe saw our prepared foods just crash,\u201d Mackey says. \u201cSalad bars, hot bars, everything with self-service closed down. Not to mention, offices closed down, so we got no lunchtime traffic. Our prepared foods dropped about 75% year over year. On the other hand, restaurants also closed down, so people started cooking at home, and our sales went through the roof. Pretty much every category, particularly animal proteins\u2014 meat, chicken, and fish\u2014exploded, because people were grilling at home... What\u2019s happened now is that our sales remain very high, but also people are bored with their own cooking, so they\u2019re getting out more.\u201d\u2014Daniel Roberts is an editor-at-large at Yahoo Finance.
