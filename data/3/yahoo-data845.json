And it\u2019s unclear if even the deluge of advertisers taking part in the action, which include Adidas, Ben and Jerry\u2019s, Ford (F), Hershey\u2019s (HSY) and 237 others as of Wednesday, will have the kind of impact Stop Hate for Profit is seeking.\u201cMy prediction is that the death of Facebook is once again exaggerated,\u201d explained Chapman University George L. Argyros School of Business and Economics associate professor Niklas Myhr.Facebook is facing a reckoningAccording to Myhr, who is also known as \u201cThe Social Media Professor,\u201d while the boycott is unlikely to have a dramatic impact on Facebook, it could serve as a reckoning for the social network.\u201cI think the impact, in terms of this boycott, would be largely secondary in the sense that it will be a time of reckoning and reconciliation within and outside of Facebook in terms of \u2018What is this platform for?\u2019 \u2018What are our values?\u2019 and \u2018How can we ensure that we are congruent with what we say we want to be?\u2019 \u201dStop Hate for Profit, which is made up of civil rights groups including the Anti-defamation League, NAACP, and National Hispanic Media Coalition, among others, is demanding that Facebook take steps to stop the kind of content that it says allows the incitement of violence against racial justice protesters, voter suppression, and Holocaust denial to propagate throughout the social network.The campaign lays out 10 steps Facebook should follow to address those issues, and calls on advertisers to cut their ad spending to the company for all of July.So far, that has led some companies to eliminate their ad spending on the site for the month, or, in the case of Clorox (CLX), through the rest of the year.Story continuesFacebook has repeatedly been slammed for allowing politicians to promote misinformation, which the company says is important for open public discourse, and the spread of hate speech on its platform.On Wednesday, Facebook VP of global affairs and communication Nick Clegg issued a statement saying that the company doesn\u2019t profit from hate, and that the firm works to deal with such content when it\u2019s deemed hate speech.Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg speaks at Georgetown University in a 'Conversation on Free Expression\" in Washington, DC on October 17, 2019.

He further explained that the company will move to eliminate ads that sow discord and spread hate.\u201cSpecifically, we're expanding our ads policy to prohibit claims that people from a specific race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, caste, sexual orientation, gender identity or immigration status are a threat to the physical safety, health or survival of others,\u201d he wrote.\u201cWe're also expanding our policies to better protect immigrants, migrants, refugees and asylum seekers from ads suggesting these groups are inferior or expressing contempt, dismissal or disgust directed at them.\u201dFacebook will survive the painAccording to Regina Luttrell, assistant professor of public relations and social media at the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University, many of the brands that initially jumped on the boycott are committed to corporate activism and want to see \u201ctrue change\u201d from Zuckerberg.\u201cInvestors will shy away from supporting Zuckerberg's usual avoidance of the issue,\u201d Luttrell told Yahoo Finance. \u201cFacebook has a habit of making small changes rather than truly taking action. The latest public movement is different. We are all seeing that. Facebook needs to wake up, pay attention and make lasting changes.\u201dIt\u2019s worth noting, however, that the current economic climate is also leading to cuts in advertising spending. According to a Gartner survey of 360 marketers conducted on March 27, 76% of marketing leaders expected decreases in marketing budgets due to the coronavirus pandemic.What\u2019s more, Facebook has 8 million advertisers on its platform, which makes up the bulk of its $70 billion in advertising revenue in 2019. If any kind of advertising boycott is going to have a true impact on the social networking giant, it will need to include well beyond the 242 firms currently part of the movement.Facebook, with its 2.5 billion users, is the largest social media network in the world. And while some advertisers may feel comfortable leaving that kind of access to potential customers on the table, others won\u2019t be.A conference worker passes a demo booth at Facebook's annual F8 developer conference, in San Jose, Calif. (AP Photo/Noah Berger, File)And as NYU Stern School of Business assistant professor of marketing Alixandra Barasch points out, the small advertisers that make up the majority of Facebook\u2019s advertising partners often can\u2019t afford to leave the social network for other outlets.\u201cThey are not going to be able to afford any kind of mass market advertising campaign, so they can\u2019t go to TV, and they don\u2019t want to,\u201d Barasch explained.\u201cThey don\u2019t have anywhere else to go, and even the big ones, I think they are afraid right now to go in this direction or take a stand one way or the other, so they are looking for ways to sort of speak out and support something that consumers care about.\u201dFor a company that has survived scandal after scandal, whether that be the Cambridge Analytica debacle that saw a political consulting firm gain access to user data for the purpose of electing Donald Trump, or reports that the social network was used to incite genocide in Myanmar, Facebook has continually come through relatively unscathed.Even the largest privacy-related fine in the history of the Federal Trade Commission, $5 billion, couldn\u2019t hurt Facebook in the eyes of investors or advertisers. Because as long as people keep using the social network, it\u2019s more than worth the temporary blowback to gain access to so many users.More from Dan:Got a tip?
