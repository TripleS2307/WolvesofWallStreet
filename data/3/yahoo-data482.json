SubscribeCompanies doing well are seeing their stocks outperformWith the stock market setting new record highs for the first time since before the pandemic, it\u2019s easy to get caught up in exaggerated statements about how prices are totally disconnected from reality especially with many economic metrics stalling at dismal levels.But that would be a mistake. Investors making decisions based on company fundamentals and prospects are being rewarded in an arguably rational way.\"\u2018The stock market is not the economy.\u2019 I've seen some version of this argument in the 15 years I have been doing this,\u201d Renaissance Macro\u2019s Neil Dutta said in an email. \u201cWe've seen a lot of this lately since the economy remains depressed in a pandemic. But, the market isn't exactly whistling by the graveyard.\u201dTo illustrate how stocks do indeed have a direct relationship with the economy, Dutta shared this timely chart. It plots the five-month sales performance against the five-month stock price performance of various retail subsectors.\u201cThe sectors doing well in the equity market are doing well in the economic data too and vice versa,\u201d Dutta observed.(Renaissance Macro)As you can see non-store retailers are doing great in sales and stock prices. And it\u2019s not just Amazon (AMZN). This week we learned Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT) smashed Q2 expectations as online sales at the retailers surged 97% and 195%, respectively. Both stocks surged after their results were released.Home improvement is another notable sector that appears in the upper right quadrant of Dutta\u2019s chart. This comes as Home Depot (HD) and Lowe\u2019s (LOW) see sales go gangbusters as people focus on renovating their homes, which is where people are spending a lot more time amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201c[Consumers] are spending less on travel and entertainment and restaurants and are spending more on where they\u2019re spending most of their time \u2014 which is the home,\u201d Home Depot CFO Richard McPhail said.Story continuesTo be clear, investing is riddled with risks. And more often than not, it could take years for a good investment thesis to pan out as no stock is impervious to short-term bouts of volatility.That said, sometimes investing in stocks can be pretty straightforward. Earnings are the most important drivers of stock prices and so when earnings go up, so do stocks. And the companies with the better earnings growth prospects will often see their stock prices outperform.By Sam Ro, managing editor.
