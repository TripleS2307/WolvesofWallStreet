Bernie Sanders and others. \u201cHe is clearly in over his head,\u201d said the former First Lady.The Trump campaign\u2019s official response largely ignored that and started by bringing up a different subject entirely: taxes.Trump\u2019s press secretary opened by saying that \u201cthe first night of the Democratic convention left out the fact that Joe Biden would raise taxes on more than 80% of Americans by at least $4 trillion.\u201dThe numbers were slightly off but are true in the broad strokes. According to analysts, Biden\u2019s tax plan would raise \u201cbetween $3.35 trillion and $3.67 trillion\u201d in the coming decade.And Biden himself isn\u2019t denying it. He has directly said to high-income earners that \u201cif you elect me your taxes are going to be raised.\u201dFormer Vice President Joe Biden before signing required documents for receiving the Democratic nomination for President. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)Biden\u2019s increases would \u201cprimarily aim at raising taxes on higher earners, raising taxes on corporations, and raising taxes on business and investment income for those higher earners,\u201d says Garrett Watson, a senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation who has analyzed the candidate\u2019s plans.Biden\u2019s tax plans have been analyzed by a range of groups, including the American Enterprise Institute to the Brookings Institution. A combination of multiple analyses found that Biden\u2019s plans would mean that the richest Americans would see their taxes go up by 13% to 18%. Americans of more moderate means would also see tax increases, but they have been called \u201cindirect\u201d and amount to a smaller increase: around 0.2% to 0.6%.Click here for Yahoo Finance's full coverage of the 2020 electionA President Biden would push for higher taxes on people making more than $400,000 a year for both payroll taxes and capital gains. It takes an income of $538,926 to be among the top 1% of earners nationwide.Biden confidante and former governor of Virginia, Terry McAuliffe, didn\u2019t shy away from the question during a Yahoo Finance interview on Monday. \u201cYeah, people are going to have to pay more taxes,\u201d he said, and predicted that Americans would understand and accept them given the record deficits and the range of crises facing the country.Story continuesA \u2018tradeoff\u2019 between GDP growth and higher taxesBiden\u2019s tax plan \u2013 if implemented \u2013 would slow the pace of economic growth. Watson estimates GDP growth would be reduced by about 1.5% over the long term, and notes that hard conversations will be needed \u2013 whoever is president \u2013 after the pandemic ends about spending cuts and the \u201ctradeoff when it comes to these tax hikes in the form of reduced growth.\u201dPresident Trump has said he wants to extend his 2017 tax cuts and has also floated ideas for permanent cuts to payroll taxes if he is re-elected.Biden\u2019s proposals, while highly progressive, would increase the tax burden on the rich less than many of his former Democratic primary challengers. Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have pushed for higher rates and even a wealth tax, which Biden has not shown interest in. During her campaign, Sen. Kamala Harris proposed tax plans largely in line with Biden\u2019s, but Watson notes that she \u201cis more aggressive\u201d on pushing for even higher rates and also has talked more about tax credits for lower-income earners.Joe Biden with his vice presidential running mate, Senator Kamala Harris in Wilmington, Delaware.

In 2017, Trump\u2019s tax cut lowered the corporate rate from 35% to 21%.Biden also wants certain corporations to pay more. Companies like Amazon have avoided federal income taxes entirely in recent years and paid just 1.2% in 2019.Biden\u2019s \u201cminimum book tax\u201d would set a minimum rate of 15% on firms that have $100 million or more in income. \u201cI think Amazon should start paying their taxes,\u201d the former VP said in a May interview.Watson has written that the proposals would cause \u201cneedless complexity,\u201d and says they are a blunt instrument. \u201cIt would be better for policymakers to think about ways to tweak the tax code directly in terms of taxing corporations rather than going the route of minimum taxes,\u201d he says, adding that the move risks disincentivizing investments in things like research and development.It remains to be seen whether Democrats discuss tax rates much in the coming days of their convention. President Bill Clinton \u2013 who raised taxes on higher-income taxpayers during his presidency \u2013 speaks Aug. 18, President Barack Obama and Elizabeth Warren coming later in the week in addition, to the candidates themselves.Either way, it\u2019s a safe bet to expect a whole lot more discussion of taxes next week when Republicans gather for their convention.Ben Werschkul is a producer for Yahoo Finance in Washington, DC.Read more:Terry McAuliffe on why \u2018business should be happy that Joe Biden is coming in\u2019Michigan\u2019s governor on whether Biden has her state sewn up: \u2018I don't buy it for a second\u2019Summers says stocks 'do better' during Democratic administrationsRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit."}]}
