About over 400,000 people left Manhattan, 40% of the occupants, essentially,\u201d Jonathan Miller, CEO of appraisal firm Miller Samuel Real Estate Appraisers & Consultants, which prepared the report for New York City residential brokerage Douglas Elliman, told Yahoo Finance. Renters in Manhattan \u201cbecame first-time buyers, they lived with relatives, they rented \u2014 they did anything but come into the city,\u201d he said.As landlords scrambled to recover losses, empty apartment listings poured on real estate sites like Zillow. In July, there were 21.6% more apartments on the market from only a month prior in June \u2014 and 121% more compared to July 2019.\u201cRight now, we have the highest amount of vacancy in at least the 14 years of history I have on this metric in the city,\u201d said Miller, who said that though more renters signed leases in July compared to June, there were 57% fewer leases signed than in July 2019.Low demand has driven rent prices down 7.6%, compared to last year in July, according to the report. The median apartment price was $3,320, compared to $3,595 last year at the same time.\u201cWhat we're seeing is lots of softness in the rental market and one of the big reasons for the softness is unemployment has skewed heavily to lower-wage earners, which tend to be more renters than purchasers,\u201d said Miller.A building at 172 Rivington Street in the Lower East Side neighborhood in Manhattan, August 28, 2018 in New York City.

Incentives are up more than 50%, according to the report. Landlords are offering an equivalent of 1.7 months of free rent, compared to 1.1 months free last year.\u201c[Manhattan has] a significant vacancy rate which is driving the need to offer incentives\u2026 there is clearly a problem with filling the apartments,\u201d said Miller.Story continuesHistorical trends show that the New York City rental market typically rebounds within three years of a recession or catastrophic event. But because the COVID-19 pandemic led to a shift to remote work, fewer employees need to be near New York City offices \u2014 so they may not need to live in New York City.\u201cI\u2019m very much a believer in a reversal at some point. The thing that\u2019s a little different is less about the pandemic \u2014 and more about technology and Zoom. Because I do think that the tether between work and home just got a lot longer, that people have more flexibility about where they can live in relationship to where they work,\u201d said Miller.Sarah Paynter is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
