Unemployment was extremely low, incomes were rising and the stock market hit one record high after another. Many voters who didn\u2019t like Trump personally could still say they felt better off under him. And as the 77-year-old Joe Biden emerged as the Democratic nominee, Trump faced a gaffe-prone opponent who arguably maked the 74-year-old incumbent seem young by comparison.Now, however, Trump is in the worst skid of his presidency, with reelection slipping away. Trump\u2019s faltering handling of the coronavirus crisis and the patchy efforts to control it by governors and mayors has pounded Trump\u2019s approval rating and turned swing voters against him. A New York Times poll this week placed Biden ahead of Trump by 14 points nationwide, the widest lead so far for Biden in any major poll. More troubling for Trump, Biden leads in six swing states by margins ranging from 6 to 11 points. Trump won all those states in 2016 he can only lose a couple in 2020 if he wants a second term.Investors and economists are beginning to make a Biden victory in November their baseline forecast, while assessing the impact of a change in power on stock values and the economy. \u201cBiden now the front runner,\u201d forecasting firm Capital Economics announced in a note to clients on June 26. Since Biden favors tax hikes, new spending programs and the rollback of some Trump initiatives, there could be important changes.Trump derides the former vice president as \u201cSleepy Joe,\u201d but Trump is the one looking sleepy at the moment. His refusal to implement a muscular national coronavirus testing plan is contributing to rising caseloads in states such as Texas and Florida and almost surely prolonging the downturn. He\u2019s offering no vision for a second term except warnings of doom if \u201cradical Democrats win.\u201d Biden is surging ahead of Trump not because of love for Biden\u2014who\u2019s running one of the least visible campaigns in memory\u2014but because Americans are losing confidence in Trump.Story continuesFor voters who support Biden, this is good news. But the path to a Biden presidency goes through a debris field of viral illness economic damage that doesn\u2019t need to happen, which is why this week\u2019s Trump-o-meter reads SAD, the lowest official rating.Source: Yahoo FinanceOn CNN this week, Nobel-winning economist Paul Romer said that \u201cif we rolled out a massive testing program, this pandemic would be over before the election.\u201d The idea is that nearly everybody returning to a workplace should be tested\u2014perhaps as often as weekly\u2014to identify who\u2019s infected and quarantine them, so they can\u2019t infect others. This would sharply reduce the portion of infected people in crowded places and drastically cut community spread.We\u2019re not doing that. Instead, Trump says he wants to cut back on testing so the count of confirmed cases is lower, which is folly. While Trump fiddles on testing, the US death toll has reached 125,000, and forecasters at the University of Washington have raised their forecast of total US deaths from around 60,000 two months ago to 179,000 by October 1.The virus is all but certain to be a formidable presence on Election Day in November. It looks like it\u2019s Trump\u2019s presidency that will be ending come November.Coronavirus cases are soaring in the Sun Belt, forcing governors in Texas and Florida to close bars and reverse prior easings of lockdown restrictions. For some reason, a solid minority of Americans rejects the idea of wearing a mask in public. Maybe because the president of the United States refuses to. Their foolhardiness is harming the country and threatening to end Trump\u2019s political career. Biden hasn\u2019t won yet, but more and more people are acting as if he has.Rick Newman is the author of four books, including \u201cRebounders: How Winners Pivot from Setback to Success.\u201d Follow him on Twitter: @rickjnewman.
