We expect continued improvement but also that the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to negatively impact our business with sales headwinds and gross margin pressure through 2021. We remain encouraged by our golf equipment and soft goods businesses, both of which began the year on track for a record year and both of which have recovered more quickly than expected at the end of the second quarter and into the third quarter.\"Story continuesMr. Brewer continued, \"The golf equipment business is recovering very quickly. Once COVID-19 regulatory restrictions began to ease late in the second quarter, there was a demonstrable pent-up demand to play golf, an increase in new and returning golfers, and an uptick in new orders from both consumers and retailers. The pace of recovery in the apparel business also exceeded our expectations but has been slower than that of golf. As a result of the impact of COVID-19, along with a weaker euro than originally anticipated, during the second quarter we incurred a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $174 million related to the Jack Wolfskin goodwill and trade name. Nonetheless, we remain positive on the ability of the Jack Wolfskin business to contribute significantly to our overall apparel business and strategy. Over the long-term, we continue to believe strongly that our scale and global reach in the active lifestyle category, highly regarded brands, and sector expertise will create a compelling revenue growth opportunity with improving profitability, which will generate meaningful value for shareholders.\"\"Looking ahead, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our businesses through 2021 remains unclear,\" Mr. Brewer explained. \"Given the uncertain short-term environment, we remain focused on stringent cost management and prudent capital allocation. In reevaluating our capital allocation strategy, we determined that our dividend is not the most effective use of capital at this time. As a result, we are suspending our $0.01 quarterly dividend. We are confident we will emerge from the pandemic in a position of relative strength. We remain hopeful for an end to the pandemic and thankful that our golf and outdoor lifestyle businesses support an active and healthy way of life that is compatible with a world of social distancing.\"GAAP and Non-GAAP ResultsIn addition to the Company's results prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company provided information on a non-GAAP basis. The purpose of this non-GAAP presentation is to provide additional information to investors regarding the underlying performance of the Company's business without certain non-cash purchase accounting adjustments and amortization of intangibles related to the Company's acquisitions, non-recurring transaction and transition costs related to acquisitions, and other non-recurring costs, including costs related to the transition to the Company's new North American Distribution Center, implementation of a new IT system for Jack Wolfskin, severance costs related to the Company's cost-reduction initiatives, the $174 million non-cash impairment charge related to the Jack Wolfskin goodwill and trade name, as well as non-cash amortization of the debt discount related to the Company's convertible notes. The Company also provided sales information on a constant currency basis and information regarding its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, non-cash stock compensation expense, and the non-recurring and non-cash items previously mentioned (\"Adjusted EBITDAS\"). The manner in which this non-GAAP information is derived is discussed further toward the end of this release, and the Company has provided in the tables to this release a reconciliation of the non-GAAP information to the most directly comparable GAAP information. Summary of Second Quarter 2020 Financial ResultsThe Company announced the following GAAP and non-GAAP financial results for the second quarter of 2020 (in millions, except EPS):GAAP RESULTS NON-GAAP PRESENTATIONQ2 2020 Q2 2019 ChangeQ2 2020 Non-GAAPQ2 2019 Non-GAAPChangeNet Sales$297$447($150)$297$447($150)Gross Profit% of Sales$12241.1%$20746.3%($85)(520) bps$12542.2%$21247.5%($87)(530) bpsOperating Expenses$300$162$138$121$159($38)Pre-Tax Income/(Loss)($176)$36($212)$7$44($37)Income Tax Provision/(Benefit)($8)$7($15)$2$9($7)Net Income/(Loss)($168)$29($197)$5$35($30)Earnings/(Loss) Per Share($1.78)$0.30($2.08)$0.06$0.37($0.31)Q2 2020Q2 2019ChangeAdjusted EBITDAS$29$66($37)For the second quarter of 2020, the Company's net sales decreased $150 million (34%) to $297 million, compared to $447 million for the same period in 2019. This decrease reflects the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on both the golf equipment and soft goods operating segments globally. In response to the pandemic, government regulatory orders throughout much of the world resulted in the temporary closure of most of the Company's operations and retail doors as well as its customers' businesses for a significant portion of the second quarter. These closures were partially offset by a significant increase in the Company's e-commerce sales compared to the same period in 2019. Changes in foreign currency rates also had a $2 million negative impact on second quarter 2020 net sales.For the second quarter of 2020, the Company's gross margin decreased 520 basis points to 41.1% compared to 46.3% for the second quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP gross margin decreased 530 basis points to 42.2% compared to 47.5% for the second quarter of 2019. The decrease in gross margin is primarily attributable to the decrease in sales related to the COVID-19 pandemic, costs associated with idle facilities during the government mandated shut-down, a decrease in higher margin Company owned retail sales due to temporary store closures, an increase in lower margin sales of packaged sets, entry level golf balls, and pre-owned product in the golf equipment business, as well as increased tariffs on imports from China compared to the second quarter of 2019. This decrease was partially offset by the increase in the Company's e-commerce business.Operating expenses increased $138 million to $300 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared to $162 million for the same period in 2019. The increase is due to a $174 million pre-tax non-cash impairment charge related to the Jack Wolfskin goodwill and trade name. Excluding the impairment charge and other items mentioned above, non-GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter of 2020 were $121 million, a decrease of $38 million compared to the second quarter of 2019. This decrease was driven by the cost reduction efforts the Company began implementing in March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as lower variable expenses associated with the reduced sales.Second quarter 2020 loss per share was $1.78, compared to fully diluted earnings per share of $0.30 for the second quarter of 2019. Excluding the impairment charge and the other items mentioned above, the non-GAAP 2020 second quarter earnings per share was $0.06, compared to fully diluted earnings per share of $0.37 for the second quarter of 2019. The earnings for the second quarter of 2020 included foreign currency related gains of approximately $0.11 per share (including approximately $0.09 per share related to the settlement of a cross-currency swap program), compared to approximately $0.01 per share for the comparable period in 2019.Summary of First Half 2020 Financial ResultsThe Company announced the following GAAP and non-GAAP financial results for the first half of 2020 (in millions, except EPS):GAAP RESULTS NON-GAAP PRESENTATION1H 2020 1H 2019 Change1H 2020Non-GAAP1H 2019 Non-GAAPChangeNet Sales$739$963($224)$739$963($224)Gross Profit% of Sales$31843.0%$44546.2%($127)(320) bps$32243.6%$45647.4%($134)(380) bpsOperating Expenses$454$330$124$275$322($47)Pre-Tax Income/(Loss)($138)$94($232)$48$118($70)Income Tax Provision$1$17($16)$12$22($10)Net Income/(Loss)($139)$78($217)$36$96($60)Earnings/(Loss) Per Share($1.47)$0.81($2.28)$0.38$0.99($0.61)Q2 2020Q2 2019ChangeAdjusted EBITDAS$89$159($70)For the first half of 2020, the Company's net sales decreased $224 million (23%) to $739 million, compared to $963 million for the same period in 2019. This decrease reflects the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on both the golf equipment and soft goods operating segments globally. This decrease was partially offset by a significant increase in the Company's e-commerce sales for the first half of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. Changes in foreign currency rates had a $6 million negative impact on first half 2020 net sales.For the first half of 2020, the Company's gross margin decreased 320 basis points to 43.0% compared to 46.2% for the same period in 2019. Non-GAAP gross margin decreased 380 basis points to 43.6% compared to 47.4% for the first half of 2019. The decrease in gross margin is primarily attributable to the decrease in sales related to the COVID-19 pandemic, costs associated with idle facilities during the government mandated shut-down, a decrease in higher margin Company owned retail sales due to temporary store closures, an increase in lower margin sales of packaged sets, entry level golf balls, and pre-owned product in the golf equipment business, as well as increased tariffs on imports from China compared to the second quarter of 2019. In addition, first half 2019 gross margin was negatively impacted by the inventory step-up related to the Jack Wolfskin acquisition. The decrease in gross margin during the second quarter was partially offset by an increase in the Company's e-commerce business.Operating expenses increased $124 million to $454 million in the first half of 2020 compared to $330 million for the same period in 2019. The increase is primarily due to a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge related to the Jack Wolfskin goodwill and trade name. Excluding the non-cash impairment charge and other items mentioned above, non-GAAP operating expenses were $275 million for the second quarter of 2020, a decrease of $47 million compared to the first half of 2019. This decrease was driven by the cost reduction actions the Company began in March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as lower variable expenses.First half 2020 loss per share was $1.47, compared to fully diluted earnings per share of $0.81 for the first half of 2019. Excluding the impairment charge and the other items mentioned above, first half 2020 non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share was $0.38, compared to fully diluted earnings per share of $0.99 for the first half of 2019. The earnings for the first half of 2020 included foreign currency related gains of approximately $0.17 per share (including approximately $0.09 per share related to the settlement of a cross-currency swap program), compared to approximately $0.01 per share of hedging losses for the comparable period in 2019.Conference Call and WebcastThe Company will be holding a conference call at 2:00 p.m. Pacific time today to discuss the Company's financial results, outlook and business.
