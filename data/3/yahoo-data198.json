Peacock has a totally free tier with access to most of the content, with ads; or you can pay $5 per month for access to the full catalog, with ads, or $10 per month for no ads. The app is not available on Roku or Amazon Fire TV at launch; HBO Max couldn\u2019t come to terms with those two services either.When Peacock was first announced, there were some groans here and there on social media\u2014yet another streaming service to pay for? In the past nine months alone, we\u2019ve seen the launch of Apple TV+, Disney+, Quibi, HBO Max, and now Peacock.But NBC has enough hit shows in its library, old and newer, to make Peacock a must-have for a lot of people, including \u201cCheers,\u201d \u201cFrasier,\u201d \u201c30 Rock,\u201d \u201cParks and Recreation,\u201d \u201cFriday Night Lights,\u201d \u201cParenthood,\u201d \u201cSNL,\u201d and the \u201cLaw & Order\u201d franchise.\u201cThey\u2019ve shown to be very effective at building brands,\u201d says Greg Portell, consumer analyst at Kearney. \u201cWhether you talk about a \u2018Law & Order,\u2019 or \u2018Friends,\u2019 or Peacock, they have the talent to really make this work, and they\u2019re in it for the long game because of the financing backing from Comcast. So it would be hard to bet against Peacock as a long-term player in the space.\u201dIt\u2019s a big advantage for Peacock, and will likely stoke downloads, that so much of the content is available for free, if viewers are willing to sit through the ads.Two huge NBC shows are missing from Peacock: \u201cFriends\u201d will not come to Peacock, after WarnerMedia paid $425 million to put the show on HBO Max; and \u201cThe Office\u201d won\u2019t hit Peacock until January, but in the meantime Peacock has an \u201cOffice Shorts\u201d channel that shows clips from \u201cThe Office\u201d 24/7.Those are all well-known core NBC shows, which is not to mention non-NBC shows on Peacock, like \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d (NBCUniversal owns Carnival, the British studio behind the show) and \u201cYellowstone\u201d (Comcast cut a licensing deal with Viacom for the Paramount show). Then there\u2019s a slew of new original shows and movies that are part of the premium tier, including \u201cBrave New World\u201d and reboots of \u201cBattlestar Galactica\u201d and \u201cSaved By The Bell.\u201dStory continues\"Peacock Investor Day\" at 30 Rockefeller Center in New York, NY on January 16, 2020 -- Pictured: Bonnie Hammer, Chairman, NBCUniversal Content Studios (Photo by: Peter Kramer/Peacock/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images)Of course, shooting for much of the planned new original content has been delayed due to the pandemic. Peacock had \u201can ambitious content schedule that was going to try and create a lot of that must-see, unique, Peacock-only type of viewing,\u201d Portell says, and COVID-19 got in the way.The biggest pandemic hit to Peacock was the delay of the Tokyo Olympics a full year. Live Olympics coverage was originally set to be the tentpole that set Peacock apart. Once the Olympics got delayed, some wondered if Peacock ought to delay its launch.Portell says Peacock couldn\u2019t have afforded to do that. \u201cAt this point the market is a mature marketplace, and waiting a year to come out would have been a bit of a disadvantage. The upside of Covid for Peacock is that because sports is delayed, it does give them a little bit of a lower expectation coming out of the gate, so they can get some of their subscriber acquisition strategies, some of their pricing and bundle strategies, tried out and tested before they have to really make a splash with the Olympics.\u201d\u2014Daniel Roberts is an editor-at-large at Yahoo Finance and closely covers streaming media.
