(Photo by Roberto Machado Noa/LightRocket via Getty Images)In 2017, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) finalized a rule to combat what\u2019s known as \u201cpayday debt traps.\u201dThis week, a new rule was finalized to walk back the protections, which stood largely to protect those in precarious economic circumstances from getting trapped in a vicious and expensive cycle of astronomical interest rates \u2014 a phenomenon that especially affects Black communities.Meanwhile, the CFPB has announced that next week would be \u201cConsumer Financial Protection Week.\u201dThe 2017 rule required payday lenders \u2014 which give out short-term loans to people who need to cover expenses just until their payday \u2014 to check to see if the people who borrow money are able to pay them back while being able to meet \u201cbasic living expenses and major financial obligations.\u201dThe rule, passed under then-CFPB director Richard Cordray, fell along a partisan divide. Consumer groups saw it as a triumph (or at least a bare minimum) and a key protection against a predatory financial practice.The lucrative payday loan industry saw it as a threat, and Kathy Kraninger, the Trump-appointee at the head of the agency, is now rolling back a key provision of the original rule.Throughout credit markets, lenders typically check to see if a borrower has the means to repay a loan before money is lent. Although payday lending trade group the Community Financial Services Association of America\u2019s best practices include \u201creasonable, good-faith effort to determine a customer\u2019s creditworthiness and ability to repay the loan,\u201d the group fought a codified requirement in the original rule for lenders to assess ability-to-repay. The CFSA applauded the news that the CFPB was scratching that requirement, noting that the CFPB \u201cwill ensure that essential credit continues to flow to communities.\u201d Other groups like the Consumer Bankers Association echoed the sentiments.The final rule, however, will preserve the original rule\u2019s limitations of how payday lenders can withdraw funds directly from a borrower\u2019s account. Under the rule, a lender will not be able to attempt more than two times to pull money from an account, and will require written notice before making a first attempt.Story continuesAlan Kaplinsky, a partner at law firm Ballard Spahr who works on consumer financial services issues, told Yahoo Finance that \u201clargely, the industry is happy with what they got.\u201dOn the other hand, Ashley Harrington, the director of federal advocacy and senior counsel for the Center for Responsible Lending, told Yahoo Finance that \u201cpredatory lenders often hide behind the idea that they\u2019re providing access to credit.\u201dExterior view of a Payday Loan Store in downtown Chicago, Illinois, 2019.

Four out of five loans ended up being renewed within 14 days, and 22% of them renewed six times or more. Three out of five of consumers ended up paying more in fees (mostly interest) than the amount they borrowed for multiple loans with one out of five loans costing more in fees than the principle.Though the industry trumpets payday loans as being a lifeline for people needing credit, the previous version of the Bureau found that they were ultimately harmful without the rule. The study didn\u2019t examine the demographics, but many experts and researchers have found that it affects black people and other communities of color the most.African Americans, a Pew study found, were 105% more likely than other groups to use payday loans with 12% of African Americans having used them compared to the next group, \"Hispanic,\" which was 6%. According to New America, a think tank, regular banks' exclusionary practices often contribute to \"\u2019banking deserts\u2019 in which payday lenders, check cashers, and other non-bank services thrive.\"Jacob W. Faber, an associate professor of sociology and public service at NYU who studies inequality and the roles financial institutions play, told Yahoo Finance that the practices of \u201calternative\u201d providers are a huge focus for anti-poverty advocates.\u201cMost of the people in this space consider payday loans the most predatory of the alternative financial services because people tend to get trapped in these cycles of payday loans,\u201d said Faber. \u201cSubprime lending is another form of financial exploitation.\u201d\u201cReverse redlining,\u201d as some call it, flips traditional redlining (not giving credit to Black communities) by giving people high interest loans they may not be able to repay easily, trapping them in defaults, foreclosure, or multiple cycles of a payday loan.The situation has deteriorated as well with the coronavirus. A recent report by the Wall Street Journal showed that lenders have begun to target borrowers for loans with \"triple-digit interest rates,\" and are pitching themselves to areas hit hard by the coronavirus, despite Google and Facebook advertising bans. (The companies deleted them when the Journal asked for comment.)\u201cThis is the worst possible time for regulators to enable predatory lending,\u201d said Harrington. \u201cWe are in such a fraught economic, social, and political time and opening the doors for bad practices makes no sense.\u201dA truck heads east along historic Route 66, past one of the roughly 700 small lenders operating in New Mexico, in Albuquerque, N.M., on Friday, Feb. 3, 2017.

In 2019, average payday loan interest rate was 391%.Challenges coming?The consumer watchdog\u2019s work on the rule may, however, be far from over. As has been the case with previous rulemaking, the Kraninger-led version of the payday rule could see a challenge in the courts, as well as on Capitol Hill.While it is possible that a consumer advocacy group could launch a lawsuit against the CFPB, the bigger battle may play out in the halls of Congress and at the White House. Democrats could trip up the final rule in two ways: overturning the rule through the Congressional Review Act or, if Joe Biden wins the election, simply undoing the rule through a new CFPB head.Under the Congressional Review Act, a regulatory rule can be struck down if both the House and the Senate vote to \u201cdisapprove\u201d it. A Democratic-led House could kick off a CRA challenge but a Republican majority in the Senate and the veto power in the White House would make the effort virtually impossible at the moment.This means the clearest path to striking down the rule comes from a Biden election in November.Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at Compass Point, told Yahoo Finance that a Democratic victory would quickly lead to Kraninger\u2019s removal. Her replacement, Boltansky said, will \u201cprioritize a review and reopening of the rule to restore the original ability-to-repay construct that was at the heart of Cordray\u2019s rule.\u201dKaplinsky said the payday industry itself could also standoff with the CFPB in court. Lenders upset with the payments provision of the rule \u2013 the cap on the amount of times a lender can attempt to withdraw funds \u2013 may attempt to argue that the rule is a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act governing the bureaucratic rulemaking process.\u201cIt\u2019s like everything else, if somebody gets what they want, they always want a little bit more,\u201d Kaplinsky said.--Ethan Wolff-Mann is a writer at Yahoo Finance focusing on consumer issues, personal finance, retail, airlines, and more.
