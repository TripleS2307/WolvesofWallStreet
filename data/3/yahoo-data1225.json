After the UFC on May 9, NASCAR was the first major sport to return to competition after coronavirus lockdown, filling a long gap in live U.S. sports broadcasting. It has held nine races since returning, and the TV ratings have been strong.On June 8, amid the ongoing national social justice protests after the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody, Bubba Wallace appeared on CNN and called for his sport to ban Confederate flags, a longtime staple at NASCAR races on t-shirts, hats, and fan vehicles in parking lots. The change took just two days. On June 10, NASCAR banned Confederate flags at its events.Just a few hours later, Wallace raced at Martinsville Speedway in Virginia in an all-black #BlackLivesMatter car and had his best-ever finish (No. 11) at the course. The conversation around the sport continued on social media.\u201cIt's been a big couple of weeks,\u201d NASCAR executive vice president Daryl Wolfe told Yahoo Finance on Friday. \u201cWe are really proud of Bubba Wallace and the way he's handled a very delicate, sensitive situation... He's under intense scrutiny right now, and he's done a wonderful job talking to this issue. Listen to the other drivers and competitors and how they're educating and listening and making sure they have a transparent dialogue... I'm really encouraged at the direction that we're on right now.\u201dBubba Wallace, driver of the #43 Richard Petty Motorsports Chevrolet, wears a \"I Can't Breathe - Black Lives Matter\" t-shirt under his fire suit in solidarity with protesters around the world taking to the streets after the death of George Floyd on May 25 , stands next to his car painted with \"#Black Lives Matter\" prior to the NASCAR Cup Series Blue-Emu Maximum Pain Relief 500 at Martinsville Speedway on June 10, 2020 in Martinsville, Virginia.

Tilton/Getty Images)That was all before Talladega.On Sunday afternoon, before the start of the Geico 500 at Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama, a number of fans toted Confederate flags from trucks (outside of the speedway facility), and someone flew a small plane over the track towing a Confederate flag and a banner that said, \"Defund NASCAR.\u201dThat same afternoon, a member of Wallace\u2019s team found a noose in his racing stall. NASCAR said in a statement, \u201cWe are angry and outraged, and cannot state strongly enough how seriously we take this heinous act.\u201d NASCAR vowed to investigate, as did the FBI and the Department of Justice\u2019s Civil Rights Division.Story continuesThe race was delayed one day due to lightning. Before the start of the race on Monday, the entire field of drivers made a public display of rallying around Wallace by pushing his car to the starting line. Wallace finished the day No. 14, his best career finish at Talladega, after holding third for a period of time and even leading the entire field for one lap. Ryan Blaney won the day in a thrilling photo finish.Alex Hayden, a NASCAR radio announcer on Motor Racing Network, reflected on air, \u201cIn my opinion, our sport has never been tighter and has never had as much positive energy than it does today.\u201dTalladega was just the second race since NASCAR\u2019s return from lockdown that allowed fans. The sport allowed 1,000 fans on June 14 at Homestead-Miami Speedway, and brought in 5,000 fans at Talladega.After the race, Wallace greeted a group of first-time fans, many of whom were wearing Black Lives Matter shirts. The significance of the moment was not lost on him. \u201cThe sport is changing,\u201d he declared in an interview. \u201cThe deal that happened yesterday, sorry I\u2019m not wearing my mask, but I wanted to show whoever it was that you\u2019re not going to take away my smile, and I\u2019m going to keep on going... I know I should have won that damn race, I ran out of gas... but all in all, we won today.\u201dRegardless of where Wallace finishes each race, he will likely continue to be a focal point for the rest of the 2020 Cup Series. His mother Desiree Wallace, speaking on \u201cThe Joe Madison Show\u201d on Sirius XM on Monday, said her son has dealt with racism in the sport before: \u201cThis is not his first incident. If he gets into it with another driver, they\u2019re quick to bring out the n-word.\u201dBy Tuesday evening, the FBI completed its investigation into the \u201cnoose\u201d found in Wallace\u2019s stall on Sunday: it was not a hate crime, but a \u201cgarage door pull rope fashioned like a noose\u201d that had been there since October, NASCAR said in a statement. \u201cThis was obviously well before the 43 team\u2019s arrival and garage assignment. We appreciate the FBI\u2019s quick and thorough investigation and are thankful to learn that this was not an intentional, racist act against Bubba.\u201dThe mixup is embarrassing for NASCAR, but doesn\u2019t lessen the impact drivers made with their show of support for Wallace on Monday.As for NASCAR, the organization is well aware that its ban on Confederate flags outraged many of its core fans, the same people who showed up at Talladega displaying the flags to prove a point. But the sport can\u2019t backpedal now.Wolfe told Yahoo Finance about the ban, \u201cAt the end of the day, the bottom line is this: We want our sport and our events to be welcoming to all and inclusive to all, and that's exactly what we're going to do.\u201dThis post was updated at 6:40pm EST on June 23 with the FBI\u2019s findings on the \u201cnoose\u201d incident.\u2014Daniel Roberts is an editor-at-large at Yahoo Finance and focuses on sports business.
