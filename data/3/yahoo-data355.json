Waller advanced on an 18-7 vote, earning the support of a few Democrats.Both nominees will now advance to a full Senate floor vote, where they will need to secure a majority of support in order to earn full confirmation.Although Waller appears to have little history of political ties, Shelton\u2019s nomination has been fraught with criticism as Democrats attacked her flip-flopping on key issues like interest rates and whether or not to reinstate the gold standard.Shelton, who recently served as the U.S. executive director of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, had caught attention for her unconventional views advocating for a more \u201crules-based\u201d approach to monetary policy anchored by gold.But when she faced the Senate for her nomination hearing in February, she backtracked.\u201cI would not advocate going back to a prior historical monetary arrangement,\u201d Shelton told the Senate Banking Committee February 13.Judy Shelton and Christopher Waller, nominees to be members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, testify during the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee confirmation hearing in Dirksen Building on Thursday, February 13, 2020.

The panel\u2019s top Democrat, Ohio\u2019s Sherrod Brown, described Shelton as a \u201cthreat to our economy,\u201d attributing her uneven record on economic policy.The full Senate vote could be close for Shelton, as the Republicans only hold a slim 53-47 majority. Bloomberg has reported that Utah Republican Mitt Romney has not committed to supporting Shelton\u2019s nomination, meaning that the GOP can only afford to lose two more votes assuming Romney and all Democrats and Independents vote against her.No full vote is scheduled yet.Story continuesBrian Cheung is a reporter covering the Fed, economics, and banking for Yahoo Finance.
