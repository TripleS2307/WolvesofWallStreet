As expected, most companies delivered a steep drop in profits over last year, with the coronavirus pandemic sapping demand and disrupting supply chains for most firms. Still, results thus far have in aggregate exceeded Wall Street\u2019s dismally low bar of earnings expectations.The blended earnings decline for the second quarter was -42.4% as of Friday, with this metric combining both the actual results for companies that have reported along with estimated results for companies that have yet to report, Butters said. That marked an improvement from last week, when the blended earnings decline was 44.1%.\u201cPositive earnings surprises reported by companies in the Health Care and Information Technology sectors were mainly responsible for the decrease in the overall earnings decline during the week,\u201d Butters said. \u201cIf -42.4% is the actual decline for the quarter, it will mark the largest year-over-year decline in earnings reported by the index since Q4 2008 (-69.1%).\u201dSome of the major companies set to report this week include Boeing (BA), Starbucks (SBUX), General Electric (GE), Exxon Mobil (XOM), and Gilead Sciences (GILD), along with the majority of the FAANG-names including Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL).The bevy of big tech earnings will punctuate this week\u2019s long list of reports, with Wall Street closely monitoring this cohort to see whether results justify tech stocks\u2019 incredible run-up over the past several months. Still, the consistent outperformance has unnerved some investors and analysts bracing for a correction, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq posted its first two-day losing streak in nearly two months last week.Story continuesAn electronic screen displays the Apple Inc. logo on the exterior of the Nasdaq Market Site following the close of the day's trading session in New York City, New York, U.S., August 2, 2018. REUTERS/Mike SegarQ2 GDPOne of the key pieces of economic information set for release this week will be the government\u2019s first print on US gross domestic product (GDP) for the second quarter.While a backwards-looking release, the report will nevertheless reflect the depths of the economic damage induced by the coronavirus pandemic during the period when broad swaths of the country and world were forced to shut businesses and shelter in place. As with corporate profits, overall economic activity is expected to have hit a nadir during the second quarter.Consensus economists expect that GDP for the April through June period sank 35% on a quarter over quarter annualized basis. This would be by far the worst quarterly decline in US economic activity on record, and would deepen the 5% contraction seen during the first three months of the year.Thursday\u2019s GDP report will likely include a grim picture of the US consumer, which up until the pandemic had been the growth engine of the US economy. Personal consumption comprises about two-thirds of domestic economic activity, and is expected to have plummeted 34.5% in the second quarter.\u201cThis is a consumer-led downturn, but we are likely to see substantial drags cross all major GDP components,\u201d Bank of America economist Michelle Mayer said Friday. \u201cThat said, the quarterly print does mask the underlying picture as the economy bottomed in April with real consumption plunging 12.2% [month over month] before bounding 8.1% in May. Core retail sales and auto sales continued to recovery during June, both rising 5-6% [month over month], as the economy reopened broadly.\u201dStill, the resurgence in coronavirus cases and state and local re-closures that began taking place in mid-June rattled what had looked to be the start of the domestic recovery both on the virus containment and economic fronts.\u201cThis recovery is at risk ... given the rising number of Covid-19 cases and states reacting to it by reintroducing containment measures that are closing businesses that had reopened,\u201d ING chief international economist James Knightley said.Fed meetingThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is poised to assemble for its two-day July meeting this week, with a monetary policy decision and press conference from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell scheduled for Wednesday.Most economists agree that this will likely be a holding meeting. Since the last FOMC meeting in June, members have telegraphed in frequent virtual conferences and interviews their commitment to keeping the benchmark interest rate at a zero lower bound (ZLB) for the time being, given the economic devastation stemming from the pandemic.\u201cOur baseline view is that the July FOMC has no major developments,\u201d UBS economist Seth Carpenter said in a note. \u201cThe FOMC appears to be on hold, in a very accommodative stance of policy, waiting for more evidence of the path of the economy. With the federal funds rate at zero and expected to be there for the foreseeable future, asset purchases of $80bn and $40bn per month of Treasuries and MBS [mortgage-backed securities], and a clear willingness to add liquidity if needed, the Fed does not seem to us to have an urgency to change policy stance.\u201dAt the same time, FOMC members increasingly brought up the need to offer market participants a clearer outline of the circumstances that would lead to a shift in monetary policy. To that end, the two main policy tools the Fed will be deliberating this week are over their commitments to the zero lower bound and to asset purchases, Carpenter said.Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, wearing a face mask, testifies before the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee during a hearing on oversight of the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve response to the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., June 30, 2020. Tasos Katopodis/Pool via REUTERSIn public remarks since the last FOMC member, \u201cFed officials all agreed that monetary policy would remain accommodative for an extended period of time,\u201d Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius said. \u201cSeveral Fed officials tied future forward guidance to inflation outcomes, while Dallas Fed President [Robert] Kaplan preferred a dual mandate framing,\u201d or one that would take into account both inflation and employment outcomes.\u201cSeveral officials stated that they preferred to wait for more clarity on the economic situation before implementing more specific forward guidance,\u201d Hatzius added.Fed officials are also likely to also debate the idea of using yield curve control to reinforce their forward guidance, wherein the central bank would commit to purchasing US Treasuries of targeted maturities until their yields fall below stated levels.\u201cMany Fed officials raised question on the current need for yield curve control, but largely agreed that it warranted further discussion,\u201d Hatzius said.Earnings calendarMonday: Hasbro (HAS), Albertsons (ACI) before market openTuesday: Centene (CNC), Invesco (IVZ), Pfizer (PFE), 3M (MMM), McDonald\u2019s (MCD), DR Horton (DHI), Amgen (AMGN), Raytheon (RTX), MSCI Inc (MSC), The Sherwin-Williams Co.
