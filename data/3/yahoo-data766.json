That\u2019s the word from former Massachusetts two-term governor and Biden supporter Deval Patrick.\u201cIf you look historically, we have had greater economic expansion and more sustained economic expansion under Democrats and higher taxes than we have today than we have historically under Republicans. This notion and \u2014 and the question about \u2014 growth has to do with whether we want a sugar high or sustained expansion. A sustained expansion means you have to invest in the things that enable people that have the economic mobility for which this country is rightly famous for and frankly, which has made a difference in my own life like education from pre-K through higher public education, the kinds of high margin industries where a knowledge-based workforce has an edge and then infrastructure,\u201d Patrick told Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade.Patrick \u2014 a former executive at Coca-Cola and Bain \u2014 added, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean any tax is good at any time. I\u2019m one of the few Democrats who will probably tell you that the reduction in the business tax rate [under President Trump] was directionally correct. The work is incomplete because we reduced the rates and kept the loopholes. Closing the loopholes is a big step forward as one example in how we make the tax code simpler and purposeful in trying to make it work for everybody.\u201dAs part of Biden\u2019s \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d economic revival plan, the former vice president has put forth reversing half of the president\u2019s signature tax cuts, lifting the statutory rate to 28%. Suffice it to say, profit-hungry Wall Street continues to voice concerns on the negative impact to U.S. economic output under Biden\u2019s tax plan.(COMBO) This combination of pictures created on September 28, 2020 shows Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden(L) speaking at a \"Build Back Better\" Clean Energy event on July 14, 2020 at the Chase Center in Wilmington, Delaware, and US President Donald Trump speaking during a briefing at the White House September 27, 2020, in Washington, DC. - At the September 29, 2020 election debate, millions of Americans will watch as the two antagonists -- who depict each other as existential threats to the country -- step into the ring live on television after months of shadow-boxing.

Of this impact, roughly half is due to the proposed hike in the statutory domestic rate,\u201d wrote Goldman equities strategist David Kostin in a new note out Tuesday. The economic researchers at Goldman believe Biden would end up lifting corporate taxes to 25% in a scheme approved sometime in 2022.Even still, that could dent profits for S&P 500 companies by about 5% in 2022, estimates Kostin.\u201cI\u2019d have to slash my numbers [profit estimates] by 15% for next year, so that would certainly be a wrinkle for the market,\u201d remarked Belpointe Asset Management chief strategist David Nelson on Biden\u2019s tax plan possibly becoming law should he win.Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
