Most notably, its online sales rose 194% in Q2. That stat comes one week after Target said its online sales rose 195% in Q2 and Walmart said its online sales rose 97%. Best Buy bested all of them, with online sales rising 242% in Q2, its biggest quarterly e-commerce growth ever.These four chains are sending a blaring signal of where the U.S. retail trend is heading, in case anyone still doubted it prior to the pandemic. If you need more examples, Urban Outfitter reported that new digital customers rose 70% in Q2, and online-only retailer Etsy\u2019s Q2 sales rose 137%.U.S. e-commerce rose 44% in Q2 overall, the biggest quarterly gain ever, and e-commerce now makes up 16.1% of total U.S. retail spending One year ago, that figure was 10.8%. To dismiss all of this as purely a result of the pandemic would be short-sighted.But for Dick\u2019s, the story isn\u2019t just that Americans are shopping more online.An employee of Dick's Sporting Goods in Destiny USA mall delivers products to a shopper, as customers pick up goods from retailers offering curbside pick up as the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) restrictions ease in Syracuse, New York, U.S., May 15, 2020. REUTERS/Zachary KrahmerCurbside pick-up is here to stayDick\u2019s online sales figure includes curbside sales, a service the chain launched in mid-March at most of its locations. (Dick\u2019s reopened most of its stores to in-store shoppers in June, requiring masks, but the curbside option remains.) Dick\u2019s curbside pick-up option along with its \u201cship from stores\u201d option comprised 75% of online order fulfillment in Q2.On the earnings call, Dick\u2019s CEO Ed Stack made clear that he thinks curbside will continue to grow for Dick\u2019s beyond the pandemic.\u201cI think the curbside piece is going to accelerate,\u201d Stack said. \u201cIt started off as a safety piece. People wanted it because they didn't want to come in contact with anyone else. It's now becoming a convenience piece.\u201dStory continuesDick\u2019s president Lauren Hobart added, \u201cWe anticipated originally that we would see a large drop off when the stores reopened, but that is not the case.\u201dOutdoor activities on the rise again\u2014especially golfDuring the call, Stack spent a lot of time emphasizing that he believes Americans began venturing out of their homes for more fitness activities in Q2. But it wasn\u2019t just fitness: camping, fishing, hiking, and boating were all strong categories for Dick\u2019s in Q2 as well. That speaks to the broad array of product categories the chain sells.\u201cI think the fitness business is going to be very good all over,\u201d Stack said. \u201cAnd people know that in order to fight the pandemic, or whatever comes next, people need to be healthy. And that doesn't mean that we're going to have a lot of marathon runners, but people are going to get out and they're going to walk, they're going to buy a treadmill, they're going to lift some weights, even if they're light weights, kettle bells, this whole fitness trend... We don't see that changing even when COVID-19 is in our rearview mirror for quite a while.\u201dStack also had high praise for the golf business right now\u2014yes, golf, the industry that was in dire peril just four years ago. (In 2016 and 2017, respectively, Nike and Adidas both exited the golf equipment business.)\u201cThe golf business has been great,\u201d Stack said, for both Dick\u2019s and Golf Galaxy, which Dick\u2019s bought in 2007. \u201cThere\u2019s a number of young people who have come into the game because they\u2019re not playing football or soccer or some other sport... Men, women, and kids have really all jumped into this game and we expect that to continue through the balance of the year.\u201dIt helps that national rounds of golf played rose 14% in June; Dick\u2019s is a beneficiary of that spike.Success of DSG and CaliaFinally, Dick\u2019s is having great success with its own in-house labels. \u201cOur private brands are doing extremely well,\u201d Stack said.Dick\u2019s own DSG brand, which launched last year, has now surpassed Field & Stream to become the chain\u2019s No. 1 private brand overall. Calia, Carrie Underwood\u2019s apparel line under the Dick\u2019s umbrella, was No. 2 women\u2019s apparel brand at Dick\u2019s in Q2, while DSG was No. 3.Of course, Dick\u2019s isn\u2019t the only large retailer that is gradually emphasizing its own private brands over outside brands. Amazon has been doing the same for a few years now.\u2014Daniel Roberts is an editor-at-large at Yahoo Finance.
