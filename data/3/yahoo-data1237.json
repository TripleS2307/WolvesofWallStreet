Protesters have rallied against the law, and the government has threatened fines and imprisonment for service providers that fail to remove messages. In response, the U.S. has revoked some trade benefits with Hong Kong related to sensitive technology. American officials have expressed fears that the new law signals Beijing\u2019s intention to take full control of Hong Kong, which has operated with more autonomy and freedom than cities on the mainland.Zoom Video Communications Inc. and Microsoft joined their internet peers in hitting pause on data requests while they examined the new law, spokespersons for both companies said in separate statements. Microsoft said it \u201ctypically received only a relatively small number of requests from Hong Kong authorities, but we are pausing our responses to these requests as we conduct our review.\u201dIn 2019, the Hong Kong government requested data from Google users 105 times, according to the company\u2019s reported figures.Facebook typically works with law enforcement to follow local laws where the company operates, but said it has paused sharing user data with Hong Kong authorities while it conducts a \u201chuman-rights\u201d assessment. The pause applies to all Facebook properties, including its core social network, Instagram and WhatsApp.\u201cFreedom of expression is a fundamental human right and support the right of people to express themselves without fear for their safety or other repercussions,\u201d a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cWe have a global process for government requests and in reviewing each individual request, we consider Facebook\u2019s policies, local laws and international human-rights standards.\u201dStory continuesTwitter operates in much the same way and paused data requests immediately following the law\u2019s implementation last week, a Twitter spokesperson said, adding that the company has \u201cgrave concerns regarding both the developing process and the full intention of this law.\u201dFacebook and Twitter don\u2019t operate in China but do in Hong Kong, where they have offices. Google has a significant presence in Hong Kong, which includes sales staff that works with Chinese companies running digital advertising outside of China.(Updates with Zoom joining the action from the fourth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."}]}
