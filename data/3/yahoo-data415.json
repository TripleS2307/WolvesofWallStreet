Amidst the COVID-19 crisis, Harmening has mined General Mills\u2019 extensive historical archives \u2014 including a review of strategies and trends during the 1918 Spanish Flu Pandemic \u2014to suss out clues on how to approach the business today.Harmening tells Yahoo Finance insights from the past interestingly resemble those being shared out and about today.\u201cI looked back from the archives from the last pandemic. There was internal news that was about making sure that you wore a mask and washed your hands and practice social distancing. It\u2019s amazing how little has changed over 100 years. What I got out of it is taking care of our people first is the most important thing to do in a crisis like this. You can\u2019t make the food the world needs unless you\u2019re taking care of your people first. Whether it\u2019s here, the U.S., China, or Europe. We focused on our employee safety and it paid dividends for us,\u201d Harmening said on The First Trade.Indeed that appears to be the case.This is a display of General Mills Cheerios cereal at a Costco Warehouse in Homestead, Pa, on Thursday, May 14, 2020. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)Amid restaurant closures and people working from their living rooms during the pandemic, that has spurred a surge in eating at home. The maker of Cheerios cereal and Gold Medal flour is hot off a bang up fourth fiscal quarter as it was able to satisfy a significant increase in demand. Net sales spiked 21% year-over-year to $5 billion. Operating profits soared 16% from a year ago, held back a bit by the company\u2019s decision to ramp up marketing.The company saw some of its strongest demand in its baked goods, dessert mixes, soup, flour and Blue Buffalo pet food businesses.Story continues\u201cWhen the pandemic hit, people started cooking and baking at home \u2014 and about 85% of our businesses are food served at home. That demand hasn\u2019t slowed all that much. It\u2019s still double-digit growth for the baking business. People are buying a lot of flour and Betty Crocker mixes,\u201d Harmening said.General Mills shares are up about 19% year-to-date versus the relatively flat S&P 500, according to Yahoo Finance Premium data.\u201cWhile we continue to see potential headwinds in FY21, we think the company is well positioned to drive underlying growth in the years ahead \u2013 even in the event of a recession given the generally more affordable nature of the portfolio (ex pet). In the shorter term, we are encouraged that General Mills is poised to perform better than food peers as it expands market share and benefits during the pandemic from favorable category exposures such as baking and cereal,\u201d wrote packaged foods analyst Laurent Grandet at Guggenheim after meeting with Harmening a week or so ago.
