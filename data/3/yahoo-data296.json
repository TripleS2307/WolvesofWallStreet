Photo: Brent Lewin/BloombergComputing tech giant Oracle (ORCL) has won the bid for TikTok US over Microsoft (MSFT).The group confirmed in a statement that it is part of the Bytedance/TikTok proposal to the US.The confirmation comes after an initial report by The Wall Street Journal and later Reuters, both citing unnamed sources, that the social media video platform is hoping to seal a partnership, rather than an outright sale, in order to keep some control over its US operations.Meanwhile, China's state broadcaster CGTN seems to have supported the notion that a deal wouldn\u2019t mean an outright sale \u2014 instead a partnership. CGTN reported that ByteDance will not sell TikTok's US. operations to Microsoft or Oracle. In addition, a source told the South China Morning Post earlier that the tech upstart has decided not to sell or transfer the source code behind its popular video app.Just three days ago, a report from Reuters said that China would rather see TikTok US close rather than be pushed into a forced sale.Oracle\u2019s proposed partnership with TikTok will still need to be approved by the White House and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US.Microsoft put out a statement earlier confirming that TikTok\u2019s parent company ByteDance informed it that it would not be selling it TikTok\u2019s US operations.\u201cByteDance let us know today they would not be selling TikTok\u2019s US operations to Microsoft. We are confident our proposal would have been good for TikTok\u2019s users, while protecting national security interests,\u201d Microsoft said in its blog.\u201cTo do this, we would have made significant changes to ensure the service met the highest standards for security, privacy, online safety, and combatting disinformation, and we made these principles clear in our August statement. We look forward to seeing how the service evolves in these important areas.\u201dTikTok is currently owned by Chinese tech firm ByteDance, whose last valuation of $78bn (\u00a361bn) makes it the world's most valuable start-up. It only launched in September 2016 but, outside China, it has already amassed 300 million active users and 1.4 billion total installs to date. TikTok has been downloaded 175 million times in the US alone.Story continuesREAD MORE: TikTok CEO Kevin Mayer quits amid Trump ban falloutDonald Trump\u2019s administration, and a number of governments around the world, have voiced concern over TikTok being a data and security risk. Earlier this month, Trump said he wouldn\u2019t ban the app as long as it\u2019s US operations were under US ownership.Trump gave his blessing for technology company Oracle \u2014 run by Trump supporter Larry Ellison \u2014 to enter the running to buy TikTok and has mentioned separately that the US government should get a cut of the deal for introducing TikTok to a buyer.On 6 August, Trump signed an executive order on giving Americans 45 days to stop doing business with ByteDance.
