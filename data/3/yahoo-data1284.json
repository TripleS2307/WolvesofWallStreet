After Apple blocked access to \u201cFortnite\u201d on iOS devices, Epic Games announced that it had filed a lawsuit against the tech giant, accusing Apple of anticompetitive restrictions on mobile device marketplaces.\u201cRather than tolerate this healthy competition and compete on the merits of its offering, Apple responded by removing \u2018Fortnite\u2019 from sale on the App Store, which means that new users cannot download the app, and users who have already downloaded prior versions of the app from the App Store cannot update it to the latest version,\u201d Epic said in the lawsuit.The games developer also said in the complaint that Apple\u2019s removal of Fortnite \u201cis yet another example of Apple flexing its enormous power in order to impose unreasonable restraints and unlawfully maintain its 100% monopoly over the iOS In-App Payment Processing Market.\u201dAsked for comment on Epic\u2019s lawsuit, an Apple rep provided the same statement it gave when it pulled \u201cFortnite\u201d from the App Store.In that statement, Apple claimed that its App Store guidelines \u201care applied equally to every developer and designed to keep the store safe for our users.\u201dApple\u2019s statement continued, \u201cEpic has had apps on the App Store for a decade, and have benefited from the App Store ecosystem \u2014 including its tools, testing, and distribution that Apple provides to all developers. Epic agreed to the App Store terms and guidelines freely and we\u2019re glad they\u2019ve built such a successful business on the App Store. The fact that their business interests now lead them to push for a special arrangement does not change the fact that these guidelines create a level playing field for all developers and make the store safe for all users. We will make every effort to work with Epic to resolve these violations so they can return \u2018Fortnite\u2019 to the App Store.\u201dStory continuesSpotify issued a statement of support for Epic\u2019s lawsuit. The music streamer also has clashed with Apple over App Store rules, and filed a formal complaint with the European Union last year that prompted an EU antitrust probe into Apple. \u201cWe applaud Epic Games\u2019 decision to take a stand against Apple and shed further light on Apple\u2019s abuse of its dominant position,\u201d a Spotify rep said. \u201cApple\u2019s unfair practices have disadvantaged competitors and deprived consumers for far too long. The stakes for consumers and app developers large and small couldn\u2019t be higher and ensuring that the iOS platform operates competitively and fairly is an urgent task with far-reaching implications.\u201dEpic Games posted a copy of the lawsuit against Apple, which it filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, at this link.The Epic lawsuit seeks an injunction \u201cprohibiting Apple\u2019s anticompetitive conduct and mandating that Apple take all necessary steps to cease unlawful conduct and to restore competition,\u201d as well as a \u201cdeclaration that the contractual and policy restraints complained of herein are unlawful and unenforceable.\u201d Epic Games\u2019 suit also is asking for \u201cany other equitable relief necessary to prevent and remedy Apple\u2019s anti-competitive conduct\u201d and \u201csuch other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.\u201dTim Sweeney, CEO of Epic Games, has been one of the most outspoken critics of the 30% revenue cuts levied by Google and Apple. \u201cApple has no right to take any percent of any company\u2019s revenue just because they made the phone people use to access the stuff,\u201d Sweeney tweeted last month.Epic Games noted that with the removal of the iOS version from the App Store, \u201cFortnite\u201d remains available on Google Play, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC, Mac, GeForce Now, and the Epic Games app on Android. In May, the company said \u201cFortnite\u201d had topped 350 million registered players for the battle royale title.Players who already have downloaded the \u201cFortnite\u201d iOS app via the App Store should have no issues continuing to play Chapter 2 \u2013 Season 3\u2019s 13.40 update, according to Epic. However, they will not be able to access new content once Chapter 2 \u2013 Season 4 begins.Epic also released a parody of Apple\u2019s Ridley Scott-directed \u201c1984\u201d commercial from that year\u2019s Super Bowl. Epic\u2019s \u201cNineteen Eighty-Fortnite\u201d likens Apple to Big Brother:"}]}
