Yet new domestic flare ups of the virus \u2014 along with international travel restrictions \u2014 are amplifying the threat, and forcing United to weigh cutting workers en masse.According to United, 36,000 workers \u2014 or 45% of U.S. positions \u2014 may be impacted or laid off by October 1. Although 3700 have already taken an early-out option, the potential losses affect 15,000 flight attendants, 11,000 airport staffers, 5500 maintenance positions and 2250 pilots, the company told reporters on a conference call.Fallout from the coronavirus pandemic is \u201cthe worst crisis to hit the airline industry and United Airlines,\u201d a United executive said on Wednesday. \u201cWe can\u2019t count on additional government support to survive.\u201dThe executive said United is burning through $40 million per day despite a schedule that\u2019s been cut to 20% of its usual capacity. In order to mitigate the impact of layoffs, United will begin talks with all 5 labor unions, and encourage a voluntary retirement program, among other options.A provision of the CARES Act requires airliners to avoid furloughs or pay cuts. However, United suggested the bleak outlook leaves the airliner few other options.\u201cThe truth is none of the decisions so far have been more difficult than the decision we are announcing today,\u201d the executive added. \u201cInvoluntary furloughs that we worked so hard to avoid are the last option left.\u201dStory continues[Click here for more of Yahoo Finance\u2019s coronavirus coverage: Personal finance tips, news, policy, graphics & more from Yahoo Finance]Follow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and reddit.Find live stock market quotes and the latest business and finance news."}]}
