It made numerous claims against Milton and the electric vehicle company, sending shares down 11% yesterday.In a statement released this morning Nikola said: \u201cYesterday, an activist short-seller whose motivation is to manipulate the market and profit from a manufactured decline in our stock price published a so-called \u2018report\u2019 replete with misleading information and salacious accusations directed at our founder and executive chairman.\u201dThe statement went on to say, \u201cTo be clear, this was not a research report and it is not accurate. This was a hit job for short sale profit driven by greed. We have nothing to hide and we will refute these allegations.\u201dThe electric truck startup says it is evaluating potential legal recourse. It also plans to approach the Security and Exchange Commission with the short-seller\u2019s actions and provide evidence and documents defending itself.Some investors were expecting a more detailed rebuttal of the short-seller report from Milton or the company, especially since the founder had tweeted yesterday that one was coming. Today Milton said he has addressed each point, but his rebuttal will have to wait to be released.Everyone needs to know I'm pissed too. You know me and normally I go straight at the BS and provide evidence like I always have. I have nothing to hide. Zero. Even the simple points I can't comment on right now. As a leader, you get shit on sometimes and you\u2014 Trevor Milton (@nikolatrevor) September 11, 2020have to take it and watch as it hurts you and others. Most these points are easy to comment on and I know that. This document had to be prepared well with the SEC in mind. It will be released as soon as they give me the green light.\u2014 Trevor Milton (@nikolatrevor) September 11, 2020Shares of Nikola fell near session lows earlier this morning after Citron Research, also a short-seller firm, tweeted its support for the Hindenburg report.Story continuesCongrats to Hindenburg for exposing what appears to be a total fraud with $NKLA.
