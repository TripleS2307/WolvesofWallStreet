But very few Hamptonites wanted to sell their homes, creating fierce competition and sending prices skyrocketing.\u201cWe\u2019re one of the only markets that are really robust and doing an incredible job,\u201d said Michael Fulfree, Nest Seekers International realtor and star of the new Netflix original show, \u201cMillion Dollar Beach House,\u201d which premieres August 26. \u201cLast summer was a seller\u2019s market. We\u2019re in a completely different place ever since the pandemic has hit.\u201dSince January, there have been more than $1.9 billion in transactions (over 800 homes sold) completed, he said. The median sales price in the Hamptons was up 27.1% in the second quarter compared to last year at the same time, for an average $1.08 million per sale \u2014 the highest in more than 13 years, according to residential brokerage Douglas Elliman.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen huge demand because of the current situation that we\u2019re in with the global pandemic,\u201d said Fulfree.But as the market tightened up, the market had 13% fewer transactions than last year in the second quarter and inventory was down 25.5% compared to last year, according to a Douglas Elliman report.\u201cLuckily, we do have a lot [of homes] coming to the market [soon] because people are seeing an opportunity,\u201d said Fulfree.Beach Houses at Cupsogue Beach County Park in Westhampton Beach, Long Island, New York.\u201cThe demand was insane, the market was on steroids, and of course supply is limited,\u201d said Shawn Elliot, managing director of the Ultra Luxury Division at Nest Seekers International and leader of The Elliott Team. \u201cThe Hamptons market filled up quickly.\u201dMeanwhile, in Manhattan, prices fell more than 17.7% from a year ago to a median price of $1 million. And discounts aren\u2019t helping properties move faster: properties spent 8.8% more days on the market than they did last year (124 days on average), and there were 54.1% fewer sales in the second quarter than last year at the same time.Story continues\u201cNew York City clients and the wealthy clientele were really looking for somewhere to go. And our market has become very appealing to those trying to get out of that three-dimensional lifestyle and have some room and a place to work remotely,\u201d said Fulfree.Sarah Paynter is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
