Here are the results compared to estimates from consensus compiled by Bloomberg:GAAP earnings per share: $10.30 vs. $1.51 expectedRevenue: $88.9 billion vs. $81.24 billion expectedThe quarter\u2019s performance was boosted by operating cash flow that surged 42% to $51.2 billion for the trailing twelve months, compared with $36.0 billion comparable year-ago period.

The billionaire is his company\u2019s single largest individual stockholder, owning over 11% of the shares outstanding.Amazon has notched multiple consecutive record closes \u2014 along with the other cohorts within the high-flying \u201cFAANG\u201d tech stocks that include Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet\u2019s Google (GOOG).According to Q3 guidance provided by the company, net sales for the next quarter are expected to check in between $87 billion and $93 billion, a 24% - 33% gain from the comparable period in 2019.
