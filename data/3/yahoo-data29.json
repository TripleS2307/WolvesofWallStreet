And for every $1,000 price increase, some 150,000 potential buyers are priced out of a home purchase \u2014 keeping them in the rental market.\u201cHomeownership is still dead in this country because the only people that are buying homes right now are people that have equity, great credit and a job,\u201d multi-family housing investor Grant Cardone told Yahoo Finance.Home prices usually drop in the fall, but median home prices hovered near summer highs at $350,000 last week, up 12.9% for the week ending October 3 compared to the same time last year, according to Realtor.com.\u201cIf you keep pushing prices, you\u2019re pricing people out. There\u2019s no way around that,\u201d said Ali Wolf, chief economist at Meyers Research, a California-based market data firm.Meanwhile rent prices slid this summer, making apartments even more desirable and attainable for Americans during the pandemic. The national median rent price for a one-bedroom apartment was down 0.1% from last month to $1,231 according to Zumper, following a summer of stalled rent prices.\u201cWe\u2019re going to become a renter nation in this country,\u201d said Cardone. \u201cRenting will become the economic choice and the desirable choice again\u2026\u201dRed shoes from above on the white arrows,dilemmas concept buy or rentAmericans \u2014 especially renters \u2014 have lower credit scores, higher rates of unemployment and less savings for a downpayment than they did at the beginning of the pandemic. Renters were more likely to fall behind on rent payments and more likely to lose their jobs during the pandemic, according to Nerdwallet, a California-based personal finance company.\u201cThere is an overlap in the people most likely to rent and those most likely to be hit by unemployment. For example, younger people and those working in hotel and food industries have both higher rental rates and are more likely to have lost their job during the pandemic,\u201d said Elizabeth Renter, data analyst at Nerdwallet.Story continuesMeanwhile, lenders have increased requirements to slow homebuying demand as they scramble to distribute a record $3.9 trillion in loans this year, according to a Fannie Mae forecast.\u201cHomeownership is being driven by the upper class,\u201d said Cardone. \u201cYou need a job that is secure, they\u2019re [the banks] going to look at how you actually went through March, April, May and June with your job. If that was even slightly suspect, you\u2019re not gonna get a home loan\u2026 You need a better credit score than you needed before COVID, and you need to secure a job.\u201dSarah Paynter is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
