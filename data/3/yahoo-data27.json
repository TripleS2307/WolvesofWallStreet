In its most recent quarter, digital revenue accounted for 44.5% of Infosys\u2019s total revenue, marking a 25.5% growth year on year.The company has also made a strategic shift to hire locally in recent years, with the Trump administration dramatically limiting the number of H-1B worker visas issued. Denial rates for new visa petitions rose from 6% in FY 2015 to 29% through the second quarter of FY 2020, according to a new analysis from the National Foundation for American Policy. Fifty-nine percent of H-1B petitions filed by Infosys have been denied so far this year, a 57% jump from just five years ago.To build out its U.S. workforce, Infosys has launched six technology and innovation centers in Indiana, North Carolina, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Texas, and Arizona over the last three years, aimed at training and developing skills for critical IT service jobs.Story continuesKumar said the push to remote work brought on by the pandemic presented a huge opportunity for employers to expand their recruiting pool, while allowing employers to seek out jobs beyond their immediate region. Gig-workers with the most flexible schedules and the skill sets matching the jobs are most likely to emerge as the biggest winners, even without traditional university degrees, he said.Infosys plans to fill 12,000 new positions by retraining and up-skilling employees already in the workforce and by hiring from schools and colleges, where the per capita cost is much lower, Kumar said.\u201cI think the magic formula to fix the jobs of the future, fix the gap and the jobs of the future,\u201d he said. \u201cTrading jobs in the market is always going to be expensive. But if you are hiring from schools and colleges and building from the ground up. It is going to be viable enough for for our businesses.\u201dAkiko Fujita is an anchor and reporter for Yahoo Finance.
