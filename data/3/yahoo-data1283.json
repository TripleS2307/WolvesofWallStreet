However, Governor Andrew Cuomo postponed indoor dining in restaurants, a decision that has slammed the Upper Manhattan eatery, famed for both its food and its politically-connected clientele.\u201cWe\u2019re still paddling to keep afloat,\u201d Tren\u2019ness Woods-Black, granddaughter of the late Sylvia Woods and VP of Communications and Strategic Partnerships at Sylvia\u2019s, told Yahoo Finance in a recent interview. \u201cWe\u2019re nowhere close to pre-COVID sales.\u201dThe restaurant received a bump in donations and business after the death of George Floyd, when a \u2018buy black\u2019 initiative started to gain strength. But those gains have since faded, leaving the restaurant with a \u201cfraction\u201d of the business they had before, Woods-Black added.The coronavirus pandemic has continued to weigh on the United States as the case count in the country has risen above 3.6 million, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker. The surges in the virus have forced companies to instill mask mandates and states reconsider reopening.Cases keep surging outside NY. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)\u201cWe\u2019re adjusting to this new norm with only a fraction, a small percent of a business we were doing before,\u201d Woods-Black said.\u201cWe\u2019re a small business, 58 years old of hospitality. People come in to celebrate and feel the atmosphere and ambiance, and it\u2019s really been hard to transfer, and we\u2019re relying on our recipes to do what we can,\u201d she added.Woods-Black explained that the restaurant is trying to make up the shortfall through selling Sylvia\u2019s brand products, like hot sauces and fried chicken seasoning mix.Even though NYC is allowing sidewalk dining and delivery and takeout, Woods-Black said it isn\u2019t helping much.\u201cWe\u2019re not at 50%, I can tell you that. Our restaurant can accommodate close to 400 people, so just doing delivery and takeout, and sidewalk cafe \u2014 we\u2019re having an unusually hot summer, so it\u2019s not ideal to sit outside all the time,\u201d she explained.Story continues\u201cThen when rain comes, you have to have contingency plans for that. But you know, we\u2019re making do,\u201d Woods-Black stated.\u2018There\u2019s a lot of fear\u2019NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES - 2019/04/29: Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) of South Bend, Indiana and Rev.

Though they\u2019ve made a recovery, current levels sit just over half of their levels in the previous year.And in Harlem, Woods-Black says the virus is \u201creally decimating people\u201d in the community, stoking fears of regulars she says have been dining at Sylvia\u2019s for years.\u201cIt\u2019s really hard because you also have fear. There\u2019s a lot of fear from our staff family, about is it safe? Is it safe to come back to work?\u201d she asked.\u201cYou know, most people are betting on staying home and collecting unemployment,\u201d she added, \u201cwhich makes things very difficult to keep the business afloat.But despite the struggles Sylvia\u2019s is facing, Woods-Black says there are still silver linings amid the pandemic.\u201cWe own all of our properties so we don\u2019t have a landlord lurking, harassing us for rent,\u201d she explained.\u201cWe also have our food product company that\u2019s doing really well during this time since groceries are up and people are experimenting and cooking more in the kitchen,\u201d the entrepreneur added.And in the spirit of helping others, Woods-Black says that Sylvia\u2019s is operating a food pantry on Sundays when others are closed, and participating in initiatives to virtually visit a senior citizen.\u201cEverybody is pivoting,\u201d she stated.Kristin Myers is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
