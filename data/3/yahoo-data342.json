If they do that before the end of Phase Three, we may find that appropriate. We may find that inappropriate, we will make a determination,\u201d Hahn told FT.A discussion about such a move, as well as in general vaccine approval, will be discussed with an outside advisory committee on Oct. 22, the FDA recently announced.Hahn\u2019s comments, following what some called a \u201cpremature\u201d emergency use authorization for convalescent plasma last week, adds to the wariness and sensitivities of the administration playing politics with public health.Dr. Dara Kass, a Yahoo medical contributor, said Monday that Hahn\u2019s statement is the opposite of reassurances he and his team have been providing that \u201conly a safe vaccine\u201d will get approval.\u201cThe idea of actually approving a vaccine before Phase 3 trials are complete is unprecedented, but it\u2019s also potentially unsafe,\u201d Kass told Yahoo Finance on Monday.Experts have warned that third phase is often the longest. The process cannot be condensed because of the length of time needed to observe the effects of the inoculation\u2019s safety and durability, which are governed by regulation.The Dakotas are seeing an uptick in cases. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)Similar concerns have risen from both Russia and China claiming to have effective vaccines. Those are being used by their militaries and other high-risk individuals in the population \u2014 all before completing, or in some cases even starting, Phase 3 trials.Story continues\u201cI just can\u2019t imagine a scenario by which we would choose to follow Russia and China on anything else,\u201d Kass said.Dr. Howard Forman, a Yale University professor and health expert, told Yahoo Finance that it would be just like China and Russia if the U.S. were to authorize the use of a vaccine before human trials are complete.\u201cWe have a vaccine now. In fact, we have many vaccines now. We just don\u2019t know if they are safe and effective,\u201d Forman said, adding that the standards of the FDA are what distinguish the U.S. from other countries.If a vaccine were to be authorized \u2014 which, like plasma, could be revoked if adverse events are seen\u2014it could undermine trust in vaccines, which is already a polarizing issue. Hahn himself acknowledged that last week in a series of Twitter posts.FDA scientific reviewers who have long experience with vaccine development are encouraged by the rapid rate of enrollment in the ongoing clinical trials for a #COVID19 vaccine.\u2014 Dr. Stephen M. Hahn (@SteveFDA) August 26, 2020Still, mounting political pressure has stoked concerns among experts over the past several weeks.\u201cThe CDC and the FDA, in the past week, have both had to go back and walk back comments they have made about safety recommendations on testing or therapeutics based on political pressures they\u2019ve had, where they\u2019ve had to correct themselves,\u201d Kass said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t help any public confidence in a vaccine when it comes out.\u201dCases are down in the U.S. week over week.

Novavax has reached an agreement in principle with Canada to supply up to 76 million doses, according to a statement.In the treatments space, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) has announced its partnership with Vir Biotechnology (VIR) for\u2014 also a vaccine contender\u2014 began late-stage trials of their monoclonal antibody candidate. The duo are the latest to progress in their pursuit of an antibody treatment, which is seen as both a treatment and defense for the virus in the absence of a vaccine.Anjalee Khemlani is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
