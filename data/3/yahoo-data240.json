FAAMG \u2013 Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) \u2013 are dominating the major indices and now represent around 23% of the S&P 500 (^GSPC).Since the start of 2016, Goldman Sachs pointed out in a recent note, FAAMG has returned 244%. The rest of the S&P 500 (495 stocks) returned 41%.Goldman acknowledges that the past is useful for reminding us that the top dogs of the past may not necessarily be the top dogs of the future.The last time five stocks exerted such a force on an index was in 2000, at the height of the tech bubble. The top five stocks were Microsoft, Cisco (CSCO), Exxon Mobil (XOM), GE (GE), and Intel (INTC); they represented 18% of the index.Chairman of Microsoft Corporation Bill Gates gestures during news conference in New Delhi September 14, 2000.

And 20 years later, they represent 8%.\u201cAs firms become larger, rapid growth is challenging and threats to market positioning are plentiful,\u201d Goldman\u2019s analysts wrote.For tech companies, the biggest threat might be the government\u2019s antitrust probes, which could allow for some new competitors to step in \u2014 something that hasn\u2019t really happened much thus far. Of those five current leaders, only Microsoft isn\u2019t facing a federal antitrust investigation (the company faced one in 2001). Most of those top five companies, Goldman notes, didn\u2019t hit their expected sales growth rates or earnings numbers, proving that it\u2019s hard to stay on top.Notably, Microsoft has also maintained its position. It was riding high in 2000, and it\u2019s riding high now. But the market turns over quickly and 5% of the S&P 500 turns over each year and new companies emerge, like Facebook, which Goldman notes was not in existence in 2000.The future big dogs of the indexRapid sales growth in any economic environment (secular) is the defining characteristic of these big five FAAMG stocks, Goldman analysts say, as they look into the index to see which companies might become the usurpers to the big five.Story continuesA view of Google headquarters in New York City. Photo by: John Nacion/STAR MAX/IPxThe analysts use what they call the \u201crule of 10,\u201d which is checking to see if the company has realized 10% or more in sales growth for each of the past two years, and whether there\u2019s a consensus estimate that it\u2019ll do 10% or more for the next two.\u201cRule of Ten stocks have generally been more likely to increase than decrease their ranks in the S&P 500 by 10 or more places,\u201d the Goldman analysts wrote.The S&P 500 has 21 stocks that meet that criteria, outside of FAAMG, including Netflix (NFLX), Twitter (TWTR) in the communications services sector, Monster Beverage (MNST); one energy company, Diamondback Energy (FANG); Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) and a few other health stocks; and 10 tech companies, including Salesforce (CRM), Paypal (PYPL), Adobe (ADBE), and Mastercard (MA).While these stocks make the cut for potential index-leaders by Goldman\u2019s test, their estimated sales growth numbers are 18%, which is behind FAAMG\u2019s 22%.--Ethan Wolff-Mann is a writer at Yahoo Finance focusing on consumer issues, personal finance, retail, airlines, and more.
