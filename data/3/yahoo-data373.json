The sharp economic contraction threatens the optimistic growth that the World Bank had hoped for prior to the pandemic, with low-income countries now projected to grow real GDP by only 1.0% in 2020 compared to its pre-pandemic forecast of 5.4%.The World Bank reported that global extreme poverty was steadily declining pre-pandemic, but now expects millions to fall into the challenge of living on less than $1.90 per day.

With more obstacles to recovery for the impoverished nations, Malpass expects the COVID-19 crisis to be \u201csubstantially worse\u201d than the 2008 great recession.The effect is unequal across nations, and Malpass said advanced economies had greater resources to address the crisis. In the U.S. for example, lawmakers were able to spend over $2 trillion to support businesses and the unemployed.\u201cThe stimulus measures are aimed at benefiting the people of those countries, and there just is not a mechanism right now for it to benefit the poorer countries,\u201d Malpass said.Fast track helpThe World Bank, a sister organization to the International Monetary Fund, is attempting to offer help in the form of up to $160 billion in project financing. In April, the organization launched a \u201cFast-Track Facility\u201d that doled out $1.9 billion in assistance to 25 countries.\u201cAll of the different World Bank arms are engaged in pushing forward as quickly as possible,\u201d Malpass said.He said the rapid funds were designed to address basic health goods like personal protective equipment, and hopes to expand the program to cover eventual vaccines and other medicines needed.Story continuesBut the World Bank has also broadened out its focus to cover initiatives focused on food and schooling. In Turkey, for example, the World Bank is supporting a project financing the expansion of e-learning. In Afghanistan, the World Bank approved grants funding an increase in local food production through irrigation systems.While many countries have been successful in administering aid, Malpass said other countries have needed help.\u201cOther countries are having trouble figuring out which hospitals need which things, and we can provide some technical assistance on that, but the country really needs to lead that effort,\u201d he said.For poor countries, Malpass said the key to narrowing the inequality gap will be foreign direct investment flows from advanced countries into projects in developing countries.Brian Cheung is a reporter covering the Fed, economics, and banking for Yahoo Finance.
