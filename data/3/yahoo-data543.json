However, the president has steadily narrowed his challenger\u2019s advantage, with betting markets this week showing Biden and Trump moving into toss-up territory.Smarkets has both candidates locked in a virtual tie \u2014 a dramatic swing from last month\u2019s 28-point Biden advantage \u2014 while US-Bookies.com data showed Trump was once again favored to win reelection, for the first time in nearly 3 months.U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a news conference the White House on September 4, 2020 in Washington, DC.

However, riots currently roiling the cities of Portland, Seattle, and Kenosha have scrambled the race, highlighting the president\u2019s emphasis on law and order.Meanwhile, a surprisingly durable recovery has turbocharged consumer spending \u2014 which is 70% of U.S. gross domestic product \u2014 and helped the jobs market to defy some of the gloomiest predictions made earlier in the crisis. The economy created a robust 1.37 million jobs in August, with the unemployment rate tumbling to 8.4%.Simultaneously, Trump has quietly retaken the offensive in several key swing states, according to a Real Clear Politics average, which has reflected a slow erosion in the advantage enjoyed by Democrats earlier this year.Democratic vice presidential candidate Senator Kamala Harris listens as presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden speaks at a campaign event, their first joint appearance since Biden named Harris as his running mate, at Alexis Dupont High School in Wilmington, Delaware, U.S., August 12, 2020.

That impetus has now \u201cfallen apart\u201d with his chances now little more than a toss-up.Story continuesSmarkets projects Biden to win 302 electoral college votes to Trump\u2019s 236, though that advantage has dwindled by 10 since last week.The violent unrest reverberating across major American cities has sparked some angst among Democrats. Ed Rendell, the former Pennsylvania governor and a Biden ally, suggested to The Washington Post that moderates and independents might recoil from a campaign that soft-pedaled the violence.A week after rioting in response to the police shooting of Jacob Blake, the rubble of burned cars still decorate downtown, September 2, 2020 on Kenosha, Wisconsin.

I have to hold my nose and vote for him,\u2019\u201d Rendell told the publication.Trump\u2019s revival among predictive investors is a reflection of polling data that show his numbers inching up, albeit from a low base, and raises the possibility of a photo finish in November.The data coincide with an economic recovery that, while having lost momentum, is still continuing to grow since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. In spite of the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, Trump receives consistently higher marks on the economy than his predecessors, polling data show.\u201cThe U.S. unemployment deterioration in the face of lockdowns was sharper than most, and so has been the subsequent improvement,\u201d said Alan Ruskin, Deutsche Bank\u2019s macro strategist, in a note to clients on Friday. \u201cOf developed economies, the U.S. has the best change in the unemployment rate over the last three months, but still the worst in the last year.\u201dThe US economy added a greater than expected number of payrolls in August, and the unemployment rate improved by a greater than expected margin. (David Foster/Yahoo Finance)A close election would likely amplify Trump\u2019s unfounded accusations that fraud \u2014 stemming primarily from mail-in votes \u2014 was responsible for his loss. The market\u2019s users estimate there\u2019s a 30% chance that Trump will refuse to concede, something political watchers believe is a growing possibility.\u201cIf it\u2019s a completely fair election, I think Biden has a 70% chance of winning,\u201d Eurasia Group president Ian Bremmer said last week. \u201cIn other words, a significant lead, but it\u2019s still close.\u201dThe ebb and flow of polling and predictive data have heightened what some observers fear could be a huge source of market anxiety. Investors are growing increasingly unnerved by political risk, and the prospect of a result that could drag beyond Election Day.Javier David is an editor for Yahoo Finance.
