But sharp selloffs that rattle the cages of the bulls (and there are many) will likely be the name of the game in the near-term as risks rise around the election, a lack of new COVID-19 fiscal stimulus and sluggish economic growth.\u201cI think they do [need to be prepared for more 1,000-point Dow selloffs],\u201d Miller Tabak chief strategist Matt Maley told Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade. \u201cI don\u2019t think we will get anywhere near that 30% to 35% selloff [like at the height of the pandemic in the winter] for the simple reason that we know that the Fed is there, and is ready and willing to inject more liquidity if they need to.\u201dThat perspective from Maley is only mildly comforting to an investment community that printed money on big cap tech trades throughout the summer only to see gains pared aggressively out of the blue last week.Crippled under the weight of fresh fears of equities being overvalued, the Nasdaq Composite had its worst five-day stretch in six months last week. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 had their worst five-day performances in 11 weeks. On Sept. 3 alone, the Dow plunged more than 1,000 points only to rally slightly into the close to finish down 807 points.People walk along Wall Street in the Financial District. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Several of the market\u2019s darlings such as Apple, Tesla, Netflix and Microsoft were pounded as investors fretted on stretched valuations and a rising number of external risks (election, lack of government stimulus, etc.). The selling pressure extended into post Labor Day weekend trading on Tuesday, sparking concerns of a deeper correction not unlike the one seen in late February/early March. Tesla\u2019s stock \u2014 which has led the market higher for months \u2014 has lost 30% over the past five sessions.Story continues\u201cLast week's decline was technical in nature but fundamentally triggered. We think there is more downside over the next month but eventually leads to further broadening out of the bull market. The S&P may be range bound for the rest of year making stock picking critical,\u201d points out Morgan Stanley equity strategist Mike Wilson.Not everyone on the Street is ringing the alarm bells on the rally, however.Says Oppenheimer senior analyst Ari Wald, \u201cThe Nasdaq 100 is still above its important moving averages like its 50-day and well above even the longer-term ones like its 200-day moving average. This [selloff] is really just a function of the strength we saw going into this peak. That\u2019s the beauty of these trend lines. It keeps everything in proportion. This weakness is within the proportion of what we still see an uptrend. We see rather than something more menacing developing, we see an opportunity for longer term investors to buy this near-term weakness.\u201dBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
