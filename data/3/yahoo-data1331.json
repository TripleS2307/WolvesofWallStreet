However, since the benefit is due to expire entirely July 31 under current law, a partial extension at $300/week would add about the same amount ($175 billion) to the reported cost of the next round of fiscal legislation,\u201d said Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius in a new note to clients.The controversial unemployment top up of $600 a week has been key to keeping consumer spending \u2014which makes up about 70% of the U.S. economy \u2014 afloat in the past three months. But it would appear that Goldman\u2019s middle ground assumption \u2014 or slightly worse \u2014 on unemployment stimulus may come to fruition as lawmakers argue workers aren\u2019t being incentivized to search for employment.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is working on a new $1 trillion stimulus package that will be formally presented on Monday. As part of that plan, the Washington Post reports Monday that the top up would be slashed to $200 from $600 a week. That\u2019s a far cry away from House Democrats retaining the $600 payment in their $3 trillion stimulus package passed several weeks ago. The package is also expected to include $1,200 checks to households, similar to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.WASHINGTON, July 21, 2020 -- U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell speaks during a press conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., the United States, on July 21, 2020. McConnell said on Tuesday that the next COVID-19 relief bill will include a second round of stimulus checks to American households and Paycheck Protection Program loans for small businesses.

Mussio believes investors shouldn\u2019t rule out a quick 10% correction in markets if there is a disappointment.Ultimately a more substantial fiscal package that helps the unemployed may have to wait until after the presidential election, Hatzius points out.Says Hatzius, \u201cThe more important factor for fiscal policy in 2021 and beyond will be the result of the November presidential and congressional elections. Under a status quo election outcome, we would expect only modest further fiscal support in 2021. Under a Democratic sweep we would expect more substantial fiscal support, as Democrats have been more inclined to use countercyclical fiscal policy than Republicans and a unified Congress would ease passage.\u201dBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
