Slack\u2019s adjusted EPS beat estimates in four of the past four quarters.The exuberant strength of the work-from-home tailwind may be taking an overdue breather amid a broader sell-off in the tech sector. In addition to Facebook (FB), Netflix (NFLX), Apple (AAPL), cloud players like Zoom (ZM), Docusign (DOCU) and Salesforce (CRM) are seeing moderation across the board.

But the widely held view is that the sell-off is largely the result of healthy profit-taking, not a broader-based correction.Slack Technologies Inc. co-founder and CEO Stewart Butterfield poses outside the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) during thew company's IPO in New York, U.S. June 20, 2019.

Derrick Wood wrote in a note last week that about 10% of Slack\u2019s float is still being shorted by investors, reflecting the high level of uncertainty and tepidness surrounding the stock. Looking at the overall landscape, Slack has proven to be a sticky service, even against its only formidable competitor, Microsoft Teams (MSFT). In its fiscal first quarter, Slack has so far held up strongly, posting a 132% net dollar retention rate.Story continuesSlack has been steadily expanding its portfolio of large enterprise clients, which include Amazon (AMZN), IBM (IBM) and Yahoo Finance parent company Verizon (VZ).
