He contrasted that business model with Netflix, which relies on subscription fees and forgoes advertising.\u201cThe four of them plus Microsoft are formidable,\u201d he told Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer on Sept. 3. \u201cThey've got much bigger market caps, they're multi-business lines, many of them have ad support and are very data-exploiting in that way \u2014 we don't have any of that.\u201d\u201cWe're just a simple, extremely great entertainment company,\u201d he adds. \u201cFor about $15 a month, you get amazing content.\u201dA \u2018whole other tech ecosystem\u2019Facebook, Google, and Amazon last year controlled a combined 62.1% of the digital advertising market, according to research firm eMarketer. Each company features or owns a video streaming product: Watch, YouTube, and Amazon Prime, respectively. Apple launched its Apple TV+ streaming service last year for $5 per month.Hastings downplayed competition between Netflix and the big tech companies. When asked about privacy concerns at tech giants like Facebook, Hastings said the companies operate in a \u201cwhole other tech ecosystem.\u201d\u201cOur world is really about data security \u2014 keeping each member's data just at Netflix,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don't import data, we don't share data, we don't sell data.\u201dTo be sure, Netflix has gained a reputation for its analysis of user data to make decisions about how to invest in, develop, and display programming.\u201cWe really think about members satisfaction and how many people are going to watch it compared to how much it costs to produce,\u201d said Hastings, the co-author with business professor Erin Meyer of a new book entitled, \u201cNo Rules Rules: Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention.\u201dStory continuesFounder and CEO of Netflix Reed Hastings gestures during a keynote at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, Monday, Feb. 27, 2017.

The complete interview will air on Sept. 10.Netflix is the \u201cN\u201d in the acronym FAANG, which denotes top tech stocks including Facebook, Apple, Amazon, and Google. But Netflix has avoided the scrutiny that other tech companies have faced over data privacy.Concern over the issue came to a head when revelations surfaced in 2018 that Cambridge Analytica, a consulting firm hired by Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, had harvested the data of 50 million Facebook users. The company reached a $5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission last July over the Cambridge Analytica breach and other privacy-related issues.Last June, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission agreed to divvy up responsibility for investigating each of the big four tech companies. The Department of Justice would investigate Google and Apple (AAPL), while the Federal Trade Commission would probe Facebook and Amazon.The U.S. House, also last year, opened a wide ranging probe into the market power of the big tech companies. At a hearing related to that inquiry in January, executives from small tech companies accused their bigger peers of unfairly leveraging control of the marketplace.Asked why Netflix relies on subscription fees and keeps advertising off of its platform, Hastings said the business model allows him to avoid issues surrounding data.\u201cIt's great to just be able to focus on our members and not to really think about advertisers,\u201d he says. \u201cNot to think about data.\u201dRead more:Netflix co-founder on creative culture: We \u2018manage on the edge of chaos\u2019Netflix was 'one of my great mistakes,' says billionaire investor Mario GabelliBill Gates: We should be able to \u2018manufacture a lot of vaccines\u2019 next yearMichael Dell: \u2018Not enough\u2019 progress on diversity in the tech industryRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"}]}
