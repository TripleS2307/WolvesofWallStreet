The analyst later downgraded the stock to Neutral.Earlier this month NIO surged 22% in one session after reporting a whopping 179% for its June sales.Since the pandemic, the EV manufacturer has secured funding and received cash infusions which \u201chave largely removed any liquidity risk for the company between now and our expected break-even in 2022E,\u201d wrote Fang.He noted potential changes which could lead his team to become more positive on the stock.\u201cSuccessful deployment of these resources could lead to faster product launches, which could expand demand and accelerate break-even,\u201d he added.Fang highlights NIO as being China\u2019s first home-grown high-end passenger vehicle brand, which could benefit the company long term.\u201cThe Nio brand\u2019s positioning provides the premium pricing power that we expect the company to leverage across model cycles and powertrain technologies,\u201d he added.Get the advanced data and expert fundamental analysis you can trust with Yahoo Finance Premium.
