Inclusion would be \u201cimportant institutionally-speaking,\u201d Ives says, as he notes institutional interest in the stock has grown in recent months, and he believes inclusion is now a \u201cmatter of when, not if.\u201dYet less bullish voices on the Street view Tesla\u2019s hype as a bit overdone.\u201cTesla will have growing pains, recessions to fight through before reaching mass-market volume, more competition, and needs to pay off debt,\u201d Morningstar\u2019s David Whiston wrote in an August 25 note. \u201cIt is important to keep the hype about Tesla in perspective relative to the firm\u2019s limited, though now growing, production capacity.\u201dThat debt, at least, may be tended to via the company\u2019s newest capital raise, but Morningstar\u2019s Whiston believes there are some bigger issues: \u201cWe do not see [Tesla] having mass-market volume this decade. Tesla\u2019s product plans for now do not mean an electric vehicle for every consumer who wants one, because the prices are too high,\u201d he writes.Meanwhile, the question of if Tesla deserves its sky-high valuation is increasingly at the fore\u2014And according to longtime short-seller Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates, \u201cTesla\u2019s not a market leader. The product at Tesla that\u2019s always been first-rate is the narrative,\u201d he recently told Fortune.Yet following the company\u2019s stock split on Monday, analysts like Morningstar\u2019s Whiston have updated their tune somewhat: he believes Tesla\u2019s \u201cability to make desirable vehicles while generating free cash flow and net profit is far better than it\u2019s ever been, in our opinion,\u201d Whiston wrote Monday, and notes that \u201cfor a young company like Tesla, we think long-term potential is the more important question and value driver than how many Model 3 or Model Ys get delivered in a quarter.\u201dIves is willing to go even further: His bull-case-scenario sees Tesla popping over 40% higher from Monday\u2019s close.More must-read finance coverage from Fortune:Investors are pouring record amounts into Wall Street\u2019s new favorite \u201csafe haven\u201dFirst he took energy trading and the NYSE electronic.
