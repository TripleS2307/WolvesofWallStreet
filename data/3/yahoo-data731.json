Smaller retail shops and restaurants have not been as fortunate.During Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) Q4 earnings call last month, CEO Satya Nadella mentioned that the company was working with Capital One (COF) in a partnership to improve fraud detection for credit card transactions. In an exclusive interview with Yahoo Finance, Capital One\u2019s head of fraud, Sarah Strauss, explained exactly what that means for consumers and the companies.The partnership between the two companies allows Microsoft and Capital One to use their data to determine if a transaction is legitimate, which has a few major benefits. First, better fraud detection means less fraud and loss. But the upside is deeper. For a merchant like Microsoft, it means that a transaction is more likely to go through. For Capital One, it means fewer instances of someone paying with a different card. And for a credit card user, not getting your legitimate transaction declined because of a false positive means a better experience.When you make a transaction with your credit card, it\u2019s graded by both merchants and credit card companies on how likely it is to be legitimate. An out-of-the-ordinary purchase \u2013 say, paying for a hotel stay online when you rarely travel \u2013 often raises a red flag and results in a declined transaction.Unfortunately, credit card companies and merchants don\u2019t usually share data or their assessments of the legitimacy of transactions with each other; the two parties\u2019 processes are independent. But a small piece of data from one to the other could mean the difference between partial confidence and near certainty that a transaction isn\u2019t fraudulent. This is how the new partnership between Capital One and Microsoft works: If Microsoft is pretty sure someone is making a legitimate purchase it actually tells Capital One instead of staying silent.Controller Gamepad of Xbox Gaming Console is seen with XBox One logo in back of it, in Mersin, Turkey on December 11, 2019.

So the fraud detection part of this may not be a big deal \u2014 just the reduction of false positives. But Capital One says that cardholders often have anxiety around fraudulent use, even if they\u2019re not liable, often from dealing with the process of getting a fraudulent transactionCapital One and Microsoft are sharing data with each other regarding credit card transactions.

Now, thanks to the coronavirus and more enforcement, stolen cards for sale are down by around 40%, and the scam business is adapting by figuring out how to steal card information better online, versus in physical stores \u2014 another reason why credit card companies are doubling down on their fraud detection systems.For companies that often end up liable for fraudulent transactions, improved data regarding what is a legit transaction or not means saving money, and fewer false positives mean uninterrupted business, Strauss said.All of this is even more timely with the coronavirus crisis, which Strauss said has forced many more transactions online and changed the landscape for fraud \u2014 further shifting it online.\u201cI think merchants are even more interested in opportunities to share data in these ways,\u201d said Strauss. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of interest.\u201d\u2014Ethan Wolff-Mann is a writer at Yahoo Finance focusing on consumer issues, personal finance, retail, airlines, and more.
