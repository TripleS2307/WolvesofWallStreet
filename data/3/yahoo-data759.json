To Ball \u2014 who has decades of experience in the markets \u2014 a C.R.A.P. stock market is one prone to a noticeable correction this summer.Read more: Here's what to consider before getting into day tradingBall is most concerned about the looming fiscal cliff that are Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans.The government passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act to cushion the blow from the COVID-19 pandemic in late March. As part of the scheme, $350 billion was dedicated to forgivable loans for businesses to prevent layoffs and business closures. Companies with 500 or fewer employees were able to receive up to eight weeks of financial assistance.But with that cash flow largely being eaten up by businesses large and small still dealing with a bruising recession, investing experts like Ball think a fresh round of layoffs is looming.That could have negative ramifications for a stock market still riding high on the better than expected May employment report and the specter of more improvement in June, July and August.WASHINGTON, DC - APRIL 24: U.S. President Donald Trump participates in a signing ceremony for H.R.266, the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, with members of his administration and Republican lawmakers in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington DC on April 24th, 2020. The bill includes an additional $321 billion for the Paycheck Protection Programs forgivable loans to cover payroll and other costs for small businesses. Hospitals and other health care providers will receive $75 billion and another $25 billion is allocated for COVID-19 testing.

It kept the patient alive. But the half-life of the forgivable loans to small businesses comes up pretty soon, comes up mid-July to August. That may well mean there will a round of layoffs of people who were kept on the job or not furloughed because of the PPP program who are laid off when it comes to an end. So I think the next signals have to be a worrisome one rather than a positive one,\u201d Ball added.Story continuesThe wildcard to Ball\u2019s summer correction thesis is whether Congress passes a $1 trillion infrastructure plan as recently floated by the Trump administration. Or, pass a new stimulus plan along the lines of a $3 trillion scheme proposed recently by Democrats.Until that gets decided one way or another, C.R.A.P. may be the newest most applicable investing acronym around.Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
