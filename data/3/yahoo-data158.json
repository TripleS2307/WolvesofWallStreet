Business owners also must show they need the money for payroll and eligible non-payroll costs.\u201cMany small businesses will continue to struggle in the weeks and months to come,\u201d Sen. Ben Cardin (D-MD) said. \u201cCongress must once again act urgently to support our most vulnerable small businesses through this crisis, so our economy can recover as quickly as possible after the pandemic. Every business we prevent from failing now, is a business that will be in a position to create jobs during the recovery.\u201dSmall Business Committee Ranking Member Cardin, Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen introduced the Senate version of the bill. Rep. Angie Craig (D-MN) and Rep. Antonio Delgado (D-NY) introduced the companion bill in the House.Application form. Paycheck Protection Program Borrower Application FormThe senators argue some small businesses are still struggling because the shutdown has lasted longer than originally anticipated when Congress put together the program.\u201cIn conversations with small businesses up and down the state of Delaware, it\u2019s become clear that many employers in vital sectors need more federal aid through the Paycheck Protection Program. Even as closures are ending, countless Delaware businesses are struggling to survive this crisis,\u201d said Coons in a statement.The senators announced their plan to introduce the bill last week \u2014 and questioned Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin about it during a Small Business Committee hearing focused on the CARES Act implementation. Mnuchin did not say whether he supported the bill, but said he was \u201copen-minded.\u201dStory continues\u201cWe absolutely believe small business \u2014 and, by the way, many big businesses in certain industries \u2014 are absolutely going to need more help,\u201d Mnuchin told Shaheen.U.S. Senator Ben Cardin (D-MD) attends the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Hearings to examine implementation of Title I of the CARES Act on Capitol Hill on June 10, 2020 in Washington, DC.

The bill would set aside the the lesser of $25 billion or 20% of PPP funds for employers with fewer than 10 employees and businesses in underserved and rural communities \u2014 a \u201ccore priority\u201d for Coons.\u201cThey struggled they most to initially connect with lending banks and the SBA in the first round and, frankly, they\u2019re also the ones who are closest to going under as our economy is not reopening as quickly as many of us thought months ago when we passed the CARES Act,\u201d said Coons in an interview with Yahoo Finance.The bill also directs SBA to issue guidance to give priority to the smallest businesses and request demographic information of P4 and PPP loan recipients.\u201cThe economic fallout from COVID-19 has been an existential threat to our nation\u2019s small businesses and Congress cannot letup in its efforts to get them get through this crisis,\u201d said Shaheen in a statement. \u201dThis legislation prioritizes smaller businesses, particularly those in the restaurant and hospitality industries, which have been hit especially hard in recent months.\u201dThe SBA has approved more than $513 billion in PPP loans, meaning more than $100 billion in funding is still available.The National Federation of Independent Businesses told Yahoo Finance that many of its members anticipate needing additional financial help, and it\u2019s open to proposals that would allow for more PPP loans.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin waits to testify before a Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship hearing to examine implementation of Title I of the CARES Act, Wednesday, June 10, 2020 on Capitol Hill in Washington. (Kevin Dietsch/Pool via AP)Kevin Kuhlman, the NFIB\u2019s vice president of federal government relations, said the 50% revenue loss requirement in the P4 bill may be problematic.\u201cEven if a business has had 25% or 30% revenue loss and they have high fixed costs or accounts payable, then they\u2019re going to be struggling as well,\u201d said Kuhlman.Coons said some changes could be on the table as he works to build support for the legislation.\u201cThere\u2019s a number of slight tweaks that we may end up making,\u201d said Coons. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that we find ways to work together in a bipartisan way to deliver additional resources quickly to the companies most affected.\u201dThe bill would also extend the application deadline for PPP loans from June 30 to Dec. 30. And the deadline for a second loan would be Oct. 1. The SBA Administrator would have the discretion to extend the deadline if needed.In an interview with Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cOn the Move,\u201d Rep. French Hill (R-AK) said he would be open to extending the PPP application deadline beyond June 30 \u2014 though he did not comment on the specific legislation.\u201cNot necessarily appropriate more money, but make that existing appropriation available to new small businesses who did okay \u2014maybe in April and May \u2014 but might need access to the funds, actually, in July and August as they try to get open at a faster rate,\u201d said Hill.Yahoo Finance reached out to Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), the chairman of the Small Business Committee, but his office did not respond.Coons said he is working to on a Republican cosponsor for the bill and \u201cit may be possible\u201d for the Senate to eventually pass the legislation by unanimous consent.This story was updated on June 24 with comments from Sen.
