The stock is up 734% year-to-date. The company recently announced its first 5-for-1 stock split, which won\u2019t change the valuation of the company, but is expected to make shares more accessible to retail investors.\u201cI think that was a very smart move,\u201d said Ives. \u201cThe appetite right now for the stock and the EV story continues to be still in the early innings.\u201d\u201cI believe this is the right valuation especially everything that we\u2019re seeing in the EV market,\u201d he added.Tesla is \u201ca tech company not an automobile company,\u201d said Ives.Next month\u2019s Battery Day is expected to be another catalyst for the stock.
