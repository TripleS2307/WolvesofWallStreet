So we\u2019ve definitely seen a spike in efforts since the pandemic began.\u201dBorder Patrol Agent Anthony Garcia stands for a portrait along the U.S. border with Mexico where the new border wall construction will replace old fencing in Calexico, CA. (Photo by Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post via Getty Images)Oliveres added that the Texas Civil Rights Project is \u201calarmed... that the government has doubled down on its effort to continue building border walls despite the pandemic. In fact, we have clients in condemnation cases who live at the property where the government wants to build a border wall. And while they try to shelter at home, we have a client who\u2019s 75 years old. And the government is trying to send out surveyors and construction crews to his home property as part of this effort to continue building.\u201d\u2018One of the government\u2019s most fearsome powers\u2019There are currently 657 miles of \u201cprimary barriers\u201d and approximately 50 miles of \u201csecondary barriers\u201d along the nearly nearly 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border, according to data provided to Yahoo Finance by U.S. Customers and Border Protection (CBP). The vast majority of those barriers was constructed prior to the start of Trump\u2019s presidency.President Trump has stated that a border \u201cwall\u201d is necessary in order to protect Americans from illegal immigration. And during a rally back in February, he referred to the coronavirus as another justification for his wall, stating: \u201cWe must understand that border security is also health security.\u201dStory continuesThere are currently 657 miles of primary barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)The president declared a state of emergency in February 2019 to obtain funding for the \u201cwall,\u201d and that order was extended in February 2020 for another year with the goal of constructing 400 miles by the end of 2020. But according to the New York Times, \u201cwhile Mr. Trump has built less than 200 of those miles, his administration has brought 78 lawsuits against landowners on the border, 30 of them this year.\u201dBut much of the land needed to complete the project is owned by American citizens. The government has been leveraging eminent domain to attempt obtaining private-owned land.Robert McNamara, a senior attorney at the Institute for Justice, described eminent domain as \u201cone of the government\u2019s most fearsome powers.\u201d\u201cIt should be used rarely, carefully, and with great concern for the effect it has on the innocent property owners who are its victims,\u201d McNamara told Yahoo Finance. \u201cAnd unfortunately, many times none of those things are true.\u201dUS President Donald Trump tours the border wall between the United States and Mexico in Calexico, California, April 5, 2019.

And because there are no Miranda rights in these proceedings, many are unaware that they can say no.\u201cSome landowners might want to do that, and that\u2019s their right,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if they don't agree with it, they don\u2019t have the obligation to sell their property.\u201dView of the Mexico-US wall on June 18, 2019, in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico.

The value aspect, however, is where many landowners often feel undercut.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the government really undervaluing the property, insisting on paying only $100 for up to 18 months of access to these properties to do surveying and other preparatory work,\u201d Olivares said. \u201cIt\u2019s preposterous.\u201dNorma Anzaldua stands with her family watching the Rio Grande river on her family's land on August 22, 2018 in Mission, Texas.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\u201cIn Stark County, in particular, the proposed path goes through significant residential areas,\u201d Olivares asid. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about dozens of landowners, including an orphanage, a nursing home in Stark County, who are at risk of being destroyed by this border wall.\u201dWhat Olivares and his organization are trying to argue for their clients is that the federal government\u2019s attempts to obtain their land are not a matter of urgency amid this pandemic, \u201cthat the landowners should be allowed to shelter at home, to not have to deal with dozens of construction workers on their property without wearing protective equipment, without wearing masks or gloves.\u201dOlivares added that \u201cthe rulings on those motions are still pending.\u201dAdriana is a reporter and editor covering politics and health care policy for Yahoo Finance.
