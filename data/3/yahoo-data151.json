Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was expected to outline the bill on Thursday, but Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) told Yahoo Finance he now expects the proposal to be released on Monday \u2014 though the timeline is anything but certain.One of the key issues up for debate is the $600-per-week increase in unemployment benefits. As lawmakers continue to work on a path forward, the Labor Department reported 1.4 million Americans filed for first-time unemployment benefits last week.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a CNBC interview on Thursday morning that the enhanced unemployment benefit would be \u201capproximately 70% wage replacement\u201d in the Republican proposal.Grassley \u2014 the Senate Finance Committee Chairman \u2014 said Mnuchin\u2019s comments may have \u201cslowed things up\u201d as lawmakers try to make sure their plan is \u201cadministrable in the 50 states.\u201d Mnuchin told reporters on Capitol Hill \u201cmechanical issues\u201d were being worked out for the unemployment benefits.One-stop operator Vickie Gregorio with the Heartland Workforce Solutions talks to a jobseeker outside the workforce office in Omaha, Neb., July 15, 2020, as others seeking employment wait behind her. (AP Photo/Nati Harnik)While negotiating the CARES Act lawmakers agreed on a $600-per-week increase weekly in benefits, in part because state systems weren\u2019t sophisticated enough to cap benefits at 100% of a worker\u2019s usual pay. Grassley said a similar measure could be necessary, at least temporarily, in the next round of relief until state systems are capable of handling more complex solutions. \u201cIt may take a period of a flat rate \u2014 like the $600 was a flat rate \u2014 for a month or two,\u201d said Grassley. Lawmakers have told Yahoo Finance the outdated technology has complicated negotiations over the boosted benefit. Republicans have argued against the $600 weekly benefit, because some people make more on unemployment than they do at their job.\u201cIt\u2019s making it practically impossible for businesses to get back to work,\u201d said Grassley. \u201cCommon sense tells you, it tells the American people, if you want people to go back to work the government is an unfair competitor by paying them more not to work. Whether that\u2019s going to be $500, $400, $300, $200 for a while \u2014 those things are still being negotiated.\u201dStory continuesEconomists have warned against eliminating the enhanced benefits.

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)Lawmakers are facing a time crunch as the $600-per-week increase is set to expire on July 31 and people will stop receiving the boosted benefits at the end of this week.\u201cWhatever we decide upon, there\u2019s not going to be any day between when they [enhanced benefits] lapse and when we decide what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d said Grassley. \u201cThe checks are going to continue to go out \u2014 and for that interim period of time, people are still going to get their money.\u201dIn a statement, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) \u2014 the top Democratic senator on the Finance Committee \u2014 blasted Republicans for their \u201cvague plan to cut benefits and make the program even more difficult for overburdened states to administer.\u201d\u201cDue to ancient technology, states need between one and four weeks to adjust the $600 boost. At this late hour, the only option to guarantee benefits do not lapse is the Democratic plan to extend the $600 weekly benefit. Republicans rejected that plan outright. They were never serious about preventing a lapse in benefits,\u201d said Wyden.Republicans have discussed a short-term extension of enhanced unemployment benefits, separate from the broader stimulus talks. Mnuchin told reporters on Thursday the administration wants to address the full package at once \u2014 but if that\u2019s not doable, they want to address unemployment benefits and school funding first.Democratic leaders rejected the idea of breaking out portions of the relief legislation.\u201cThis is a package. We cannot piecemeal this,\u201d said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) at a press conference on Capitol Hill. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to take care of one portion of suffering people and leave everyone else hanging,\u201d added Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY).Jessica Smith is a reporter for Yahoo Finance based in Washington, D.C.
