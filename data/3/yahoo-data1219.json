(Across retail, the curbside option is also being called BOPIS: Buy online and pick up in store.)Curbside was hugely popular and helped drive Dick\u2019s to a record Q2. Consider this stat: 75% of Dick\u2019s online orders in Q2 were fulfilled by stores (either shipped to a customer from their nearest store or picked up curbside, rather than shipped from a warehouse). Now, even after Dick\u2019s reopened its stores to in-store shoppers (masks on) in June, curbside continues to thrive. \u201cWe anticipated originally that we would see a large drop-off when the stores reopened,\u201d Dick\u2019s president Lauren Hobart said on the earnings call, \u201cbut that is not the case.\u201d Dick\u2019s CEO Ed Stack declared: \u201cIt started off as a safety piece. People wanted it because they didn't want to come in contact with anyone else. It's now becoming a convenience piece.\u201dDick\u2019s (DKS) isn\u2019t the only one. Best Buy (BBY) moved to a curbside-only model at all its stores in late March, and its online sales rose an eye-popping 242% in the second quarter. The electronics chain reopened its stores to shoppers in June, but CEO Corie Barry said on the earnings call that it will not only continue to offer curbside, but will enhance it by \u201cadding functionality that will display information about high and low traffic times and provide digital updates for customers when they are in the parking lot waiting for their curbside orders.\u201dAn employee of Best Buy delivers products to a shopper, as customers pick up goods from retailers offering curbside pick up as the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) restrictions ease in Syracuse, New York, U.S., May 15, 2020.

That\u2019s why McKinsey senior partner Sajal Kohli thinks the option is here to stay, even beyond the pandemic.\u201cWe think curbside is going to be exceptionally sticky,\u201d Kohli tells Yahoo Finance. \u201cThe fundamental question for most retailers is, if you think about the retail box and the physical footprint, what\u2019s the strategic intent of the box in the world of omni-channel post-COVID? Some categories are still going to be incredibly conducive to in-store interaction, but for several categories, I think consumers discovered this newfound convenience and they will actually stick to curbside, which has massive implications, as you can imagine, for retail.\u201dStory continuesThe implications start with a company\u2019s supply chain: the growth of curbside is a \u201cmassive pivot,\u201d Kohli says, that will shift many chains to \u201csmall-drop economics\u201d rather than giant trailer-loads of goods being brought to every store.A man wearing a mask walks past restaurant advertising curbside pickup during the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Washington, U.S. April 10, 2020. REUTERS/Joshua RobertsAnd it isn\u2019t just retail purchases: curbside pickup for food has soared amid the pandemic.Walmart (WMT) had a huge Q2 in which its online sales rose 97%, and the company highlighted the growth of its grocery business and curbside grocery pickup in the quarter.That was already starting before the pandemic. Walmart U.S. president Greg Foran told Yahoo Finance a year ago that online grocery was creating a \u201chalo effect\u201d on the rest of Walmart\u2019s business.Of course, food chains like Chipotle, Starbucks, and Dunkin\u2019 Donuts have already made huge gains in mobile ordering and quick pickup before the pandemic, and were well-suited to beef up that option while stores were closed for months. (Domino\u2019s calls its version \u201ccarside pickup.\u201d) They save on delivery costs, and customers get instant satisfaction.\u2014Daniel Roberts is an editor-at-large at Yahoo Finance.
