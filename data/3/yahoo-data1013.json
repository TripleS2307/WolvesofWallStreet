The Big-12, however, decided Tuesday it would continue its season. Meanwhile, other conferences are still weighing their options.Questions about how this could affect decisions in the National Football League, which is also weighing its ability to play its regular season. The Washington Football Team announced it would hold its regular season games, but without fans.In the U.S., the COVID-19 case count jumped by 100,000 Wednesday to 5.1 million, and deaths are approaching 165,000. Globally, cases are reaching 20.5 million and more than 744,000 have died from the virus.However, optimism remains high for a successful coronavirus vaccine in the U.S. by the end of the year \u2014 even though widespread distribution is unlikely until mid-2021.Moderna (MRNA), the frontrunner in the U.S., struck a deal to provide 100 million doses of its two-shot vaccine to the U.S. for up to $1.5 billion. That is in addition to $955 million from the federal government to license the vaccine.Other companies have also promised hundreds of millions of doses to the U.S. in similar deals through Operation Warp Speed (OWS).To-date, the U.S. has deals for several hundred million doses, for a total of more than $8 billion. OWS has stated its aim is to secure at least 300 million doses.CLEMSON, SOUTH CAROLINA - JUNE 10: A view of Clemson Memorial Stadium on the campus of Clemson University on June 10, 2020 in Clemson, South Carolina.

This is a stock price issue,\u201d he said.Marks said that the news is encouraging, but positive early trial results don\u2019t always translate to a successful vaccine.The FDA anticipates being able to issue an emergency use approval for a vaccine, but officials have repeated that nothing will be rushed. Marks reiterated that point, adding that in the past the FDA has been able to approve vaccines on an accelerated basis, but only when more is known about the disease.\u201cBecause we don\u2019t have that now, for the first vaccines ... we don\u2019t expect to be using our accelerated approval provisions because we don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have enough knowledge\u201d to correlate to the clinical outcomes, Marks said.Anjalee Khemlani is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
