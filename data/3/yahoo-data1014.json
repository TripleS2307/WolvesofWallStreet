She pointed to the enduring financial losses suffered by ballet performers as well as mental and physical strain, adding that ballet companies should consider outdoor performances amid the pandemic.\u201cIt's going to impact us for a couple of years to come,\u201d says Copeland, who has danced for the American Ballet Theater for two decades and appeared in a 2018 movie adaptation of \u201cThe Nutcracker.\u201d\u201cI feel like a lot of the impact we haven't even seen yet,\u201d she says.\u201cIt's been difficult for people who spend their days \u2014 spend their lives \u2014 invested in this art form,\u201d she says. \u201cWe're very physical people. We spend hours at a time partnering one another and [in a] very intimate environment\u201d\u201cGetting out of that and not having that personal human connection,\u201d she says, \u201cis a bit shocking.\u201dThe American Ballet Theater, one of the nation\u2019s most prominent ballet companies for which Copeland became the first Black principal dancer in 2015, has canceled its spring and fall seasons and said last month that it could not yet announce plans for reopening, the New York Times reported.The New York City Ballet and Pennsylvania Ballet have canceled the rest of their 2020 performances, including \u201cThe Nutcracker\u201d \u2014 a top annual holiday event for many companies.\u201cOutdoor performances are definitely something that we should all be looking at,\u201d Copeland says, in an interview taped on July 16.NEW YORK, NY - MAY 21: Misty Copeland attends the 2018 American Ballet Theatre Spring Gala at The Metropolitan Opera House on May 21, 2018 in New York City.
