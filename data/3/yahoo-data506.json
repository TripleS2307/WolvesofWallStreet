The S&P 500, meanwhile, has effectively recovered its losses, and is now down only 1.5% year-to-date.I-banking and cost cuttingAs banks brace for greater loan losses through those reserve builds, large U.S. banks with diversified revenue streams may look beyond the loan books to make money.Story continuesKBW and RBC noted that the companies with large investment banking divisions are poised for success in the second quarter, specifically highlighting JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs (GS), and Morgan Stanley (MS).Capital markets were likely aided during the second quarter by the Federal Reserve\u2019s liquidity interventions in a number of markets (such as municipal debt, corporate debt, U.S. Treasuries, U.S. dollar funding) that restored confidence among market-makers like the large investment banks.\u201cWe are expecting very strong trading results this quarter as credit spreads have compressed, bid-ask spreads remain wide, and trading activity remains high,\u201d Kleinhanzl wrote.At RBC, Cassidy expects investment banking revenues to rise by 6.8% year-over-year among the largest U.S. banks, driven by higher gains specifically in debt capital markets.Banks may also highlight cost-cutting in their earnings. Some banks are already trimming headcount; Bloomberg reported last week that Wells Fargo is planning thousands of job cuts.The San Francisco-based bank, however, has been dealing with reputational and regulatory challenges over the past few years and will likely be the only large bank to announce a dividend cut in earnings this week. Due to the COVID-19 disruptions, the Federal Reserve has barred the largest U.S. banks from share buybacks through at least the third quarter, although banks are still allowed to pay out dividends.But secular trends in the banking industry have pointed to reduced headcount well before the arrival of COVID-19. Wells Fargo\u2019s banking analyst Mike Mayo has predicted that automation and the growth of mobile banking will lead to 200,000 job cuts over the next 10 years.Brian Cheung is a reporter covering the Fed, economics, and banking for Yahoo Finance.
