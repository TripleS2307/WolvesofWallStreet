Quibi did not launch with an option to cast Quibi to your TV.Downloads have severely disappointed. Daily downloads of the app have fallen precipitously since launch day, according to research firm Sensor Tower, and Quibi\u2019s current pace is for fewer than 2 million paying subscribers in its first year, compared to Quibi\u2019s own original target of 7.4 million, according to the Wall Street Journal. Quibi costs $4.99 per month with ads, $7.99 without adds.This month, Quibi asked its top executives to take 10% pay cuts. Quibi has also reduced its marketing amid the nationwide social justice reform protests after the killing of George Floyd.Quibi founder and former DreamWorks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg, in an interview with the New York Times in May, blamed Quibi\u2019s problems on coronavirus: \u201cI attribute everything that has gone wrong to coronavirus. Everything.\u201dBut Quibi also faces a patent lawsuit from video startup Eko, bankrolled by hedge fund Elliott Management. (The lawsuit is over Quibi\u2019s feature that rotates the video depending on the orientation of the viewer\u2019s phone; ironically, some reviews of the app complain that the portrait mode still cuts off part of the screen.)And Quibi has been criticized for the huge paydays it gave to stars like Reese Witherspoon ($6 million to narrate a nature program), whose husband, former CAA agent Jim Toth, is Quibi\u2019s head of content acquisitions and talent.On top of all those issues, the Wall Street Journal now reports that Katzenberg and Quibi CEO Meg Whitman are at odds, and that their working relationship \u201chad worsened to the point that it put the company\u2019s future in jeopardy.\u201dStory continuesKatzenberg can\u2019t blame all of that on coronavirus.PARK CITY, UTAH - JANUARY 24: Jeffrey Katzenberg demonstrates Quibi's Turnstyle technology at Sundance 2020 on January 24, 2020 in Park City, Utah.

The \u201cstreaming wars\u201d have given birth to a massive spending bubble in which content creators, studios, and big tech companies are frantically throwing money at streaming ventures in a race to keep up with Netflix.Apple did it with Apple TV+, which is not yet a proven success despite an initial spend of $6 billion on original shows like \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d with Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, and Steve Carell, and \u201cSee\u201d with Jason Momoa.Disney has done it (spending $28 billion on all original content in 2019) with Disney+, an instant subscriber hit thanks more to Disney\u2019s vast existing content library than to new content (with the exception of \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d), but is now navigating internal disputes because it also bought majority control of Hulu and has tried to integrate the back-end engineering tech with the Disney+ and ESPN+ teams.ViacomCBS spent around $15 billion on original content in 2019, pushing CBS All Access and its anchor original show \u201cPicard.\u201d AT&T-owned WarnerMedia spent $14 billion on non-sports content last year, nearly double its budget from the year prior, and had its own branding problems with the confusing launch of HBO Max last month. Comcast still plans to launch NBC Peacock next month without the Tokyo Olympics, which was set to be the app\u2019s main appeal at launch.Quibi CEO Meg Whitman (R) and Quibi founder Jeffrey Katzenberg speak about their short-form video streaming service Quibi during their keynote address January 8, 2020 at the 2020 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Even with a long list of shows featuring big stars like Chrissy Tiegen (\u201cChrissy\u2019s Court\u201d), Jennifer Lopez (\u201cThanks a Million\u201d), Chance the Rapper (\u201cPunk\u2019d\u201d), Megan Rapinoe (\u201cProdigy\u201d), none of Quibi\u2019s shows have started any kind of cultural conversation.The current top dogs in streaming all made their names on the shoulders of one or two mega-hit original shows. \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and \u201cOrange is the New Black\u201d premiered in 2013 and put the \u201cNetflix Original Series\u201d label on the map. Then Netflix added \u201cThe Crown\u201d and \u201cStranger Things\u201d in 2016. Amazon Prime Video got started with \u201cBosch\u201d and \u201cTransparent\u201d in 2014, then had its first truly huge hit with \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d in 2018. Hulu\u2019s moment came with \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d in 2017.Each of these exclusive shows are big enough hits that they convinced people to pay for those platforms. Quibi doesn\u2019t have one yet, and there is reasonable doubt over whether any show with 10-minute episodes can become that level of hit.\u2014Daniel Roberts is an editor-at-large at Yahoo Finance.
