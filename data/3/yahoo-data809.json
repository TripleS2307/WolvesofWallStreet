More than 30 million people were receiving unemployment checks in the first week of June, about a fifth of the labor force.At last month's policy meeting, the Fed signaled it planned years of extraordinary support for the economy, with policymakers projecting the economy to shrink 6.5% in 2020 and the unemployment rate to be 9.3% at the end of the year.In addition to slashing interest rates, the central bank has also pumped trillions of dollars into the economy to keep credit flowing to businesses and households.Americans' anxieties over the spread of the coronavirus are at the highest level in more than a month, a Reuters/Ipsos poll showed on Wednesday, a day after the United States recorded the biggest single-day rise in new cases since the pandemic began.(Reporting by Lindsay Dunsmuir, Ann Saphir, Howard Schneider and Jonnelle Marte; Editing by Paul Simao)"}]}
