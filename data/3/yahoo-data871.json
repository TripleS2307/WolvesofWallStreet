Recently, a few popular creators have chosen to leave the platform in favor of competitor Triller, citing privacy and security concerns.\u201cI\u2019m in the camp where every company has so much data on us Facebook, Instagram, Google. I don\u2019t know how it would be different, maybe you have to worry about the Chinese government having it and doing something malicious with it,\u201d Zach King, a TikTok star with over 47 million followers on the app, told Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cThe Final Round\u201d in an interview.\u201cBut I think if there are security issues I think we should clear them up. As a user I\u2019d love to know what those are to be wary about,\u201d he added.Tech giant Microsoft (MSFT) is the prime candidate to purchase TikTok from ByteDance, its Chinese parent company, by September 15.Although many TikTok creators have been shaken by the threat \u2014 asking fans to follow them on other social media platforms \u2014 King suggested it could be an opportunity in disguise.\u201cThis is not the first time we\u2019ve seen this...that\u2019s part of the ecosystem, that\u2019s part of the landscape of being a digital creator,\u201d he explained.CHINA - 2020/08/10: In this photo illustration a TikTok logo is seen displayed on a smartphone.

In addition to being the third most followed creator on TikTok, he boasts over 8 million subscribers on YouTube, and 23 million followers on Instagram.However, King tipped his hat to TikTok \u2014 which he compared to Vine, the now defunct short-form video app that was wildly popular before being shut down several years ago.Story continuesVine was an app \u201cwhere things could instantly go viral within a couple hours. And that\u2019s what the power of TikTok is,\u201d King explained.In an effort to position itself for TikTok\u2019s possible demise, Facebook (FB) recently launched Instagram Reels, an alternative King suggested he would consider.\u201cI\u2019m looking at platforms that spark my interest. They either have tools that I really enjoy or an alive community,\u201d he told Yahoo Finance. He spoke favorably about Byte, a short-form video platform used to create 15 second looped videos, and founded by Dom Hofmann, co-founder of Vine.Sara Dramer is an associate producer at Yahoo Finance.
