In these hard times, that\u2019s a lot of money and I think a lot of people would take the vaccine for $1,000.\u201dOnce the U.S. epicenter, New York's coronavirus cases have decreased dramatically. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)Top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, who said recently he would \u201csettle\u201d for a vaccine that is 70-75% effective, has stated that the U.S. would not reach herd immunity if as many as 25% of the population chose to not get vaccinated.\"That's one of the reasons why we have to make sure we engage the community as we're doing now, to get community people to help us, for people to understand that we are doing everything we can to show that it's safe and that it's effective and that it's for the good of them as individuals and in society to take the vaccine,\" he told CNN in June.Americans who step forward to take the vaccine should receive $200 upfront, according to Litan\u2019s proposal, with the remainder being paid once the country has reached herd immunity.\u201cSo now everyone that takes the vaccine has an incentive to go on social media,\u201d Litan said, \u201ctalk to their friends, talk to their family, talk to their church colleagues, etc work colleagues, and say, \u2018Hey take the vaccine because you and I will both get that extra $800.\u2019\u201dStory continuesCounselor to the President Kellyanne Conway wears a mask before the US president speaks on vaccine development in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, DC on May 15, 2020. (Photo: MANDEL NGAN / AFP)\u2018The alternative is as long as people stay home\u2019Litan added that trying to mandate a vaccine shot on the population could backfire.\u201cIf the government tried to force people, you\u2019d have a huge counter reaction,\u201d he said, \u201cmuch worse than the anti-masking kind of thing we see today.\u201dPaying Americans $1,000 each to reach 80% herd immunity would cost the U.S. roughly $275 billion.\u201cThe alternative is as long as people stay home and we have massive unemployment,\u201d Litan said. \u201cWe\u2019re losing trillions of dollars annually in lost economic output because our economy is not at full employment. And so to get a shot for $275 billion to get our lives back and our economy back seems to me the best investment you can make and it\u2019s cheap in comparison to the alternative.\u201dLitan\u2019s proposal has its critics, including Milken Institute Chief Economist William Lee.\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of money,\u201d Lee exclaimed. \u201cJust to get that number in perspective, that\u2019s half the cost of Medicaid [spending],\u201d he said, which totaled $616 billion in 2019.More from Sibile:Democratic Rep. blasts Trump on USPS woes: \u2018No hope\u2019 of waking up knowing who won the electionTrump payroll tax deferment is \u2018employee relations disaster\u2019Coronavirus gut check: How small businesses are survivingHow Hollywood content can \u2018normalize injustice\u2019Michigan Gov.
