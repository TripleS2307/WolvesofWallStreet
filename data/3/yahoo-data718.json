The firm\u2019s proprietary consumer research found that Netflix led the streaming field as the No. 1 service people plan to keep post-COVID, and showed an increased willingness among subscribers to pay more for Netflix.\u201cNetflix has furthered its position as the go-to streaming option,\u201d Kim wrote in the note. \u201c[W]hile we recognize some of the record-setting sub adds were pulled forward, we also believe the trend was an acceleration of an ongoing shift from broadcast TV to streaming.\u201dPer Piper Sandler\u2019s survey of 1,000 U.S. consumers asking \u201cWhat video services will you use after stay-at-home rules ease?\u201d Netflix was the clear top choice \u2014 with 41% citing the service as a keeper.
