Shares of reopening stocks including airlines, cruise lines and travel companies fell, after a company front-running the race to develop a Covid-19 vaccine had its trial put on pause.[Click here to read what\u2019s moving markets heading into Thursday, September 10]Shares of Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) each extended their gains to more than 4% in intraday trading, rebounding after investors over the past three sessions poured out of these leaders from the past several months. Tesla (TSLA) shares rose more than 7%, after the stock slumped 21% in its worst single session decline on record earlier in the day. The S&P 500 rose more than 2.5%, after the index sustained a 7% loss over the course of the prior three sessions.In spite of the morning bounce, some analysts warned that the rotation away from technology and \u201cstay-at-home\u201d stocks could continue over the next few months.\u201cI think they definitely have more to go on the downside before they bounce in any kind of meaningful way,\u201d Matt Maley, chief strategist at Miller Tabek, told Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade on Tuesday. \u201cThese are great companies on a long-term basis, but since they got so far ahead of themselves, I think they\u2019ve got further to drop, and they won\u2019t bounce back as quickly as a lot of people think they will.\u201dEven after the past several sessions\u2019 worth of sharp declines, Amazon\u2019s stock remained higher by 70% for the year to date, Apple\u2019s held higher by 54%, and Facebook\u2019s by 32%. That compares to a 3% gain for the S&P 500 over the same time period.Other strategists echoed similar sentiments, suggesting investors should brace for volatility in the near-term especially in growth and tech names.\u201cWe think there is more downside over next month but eventually leads to further broadening out of the bull market,\u201d Morgan Stanley strategist Mike Wilson said in a note Tuesday. \u201cThe S&P may be range bound for the rest of year making stock picking critical.\u201dStory continuesThe risk-off sentiment also spilled over into other asset classes, with US crude oil prices (CL=F) dropping 7.6% to settle at their lowest level since June Tuesday afternoon. This came after Saudi Aramco slashed its October crude prices by a greater than anticipation margin, signaling its expectation for extended weakness in energy demand as individuals continue to eschew travel and other discretionary consumption during the pandemic.
