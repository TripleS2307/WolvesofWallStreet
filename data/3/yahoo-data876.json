However, the process has become increasingly fraught with politics, as President Donald Trump ramps up expectations of a rapid vaccine discovery \u2014 and an growing chorus of medical experts challenge the aggressive development timetable.The head of Operation Warp Speed, Moncef Slaoui has said he will resign if there is political interference, following similar comments from U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s top vaccine official.\u201cI would immediately resign if there is undue interference in this process,\u201d Slaoui told Science Insider in an interview published on Thursday.Peter Marks, director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, made a similar commitment last month, echoing repeated assurances from both U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Sec. Alex Azar and FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn in recent weeks.The comments contrast starkly against White House officials pushing the idea that a vaccine could be authorized by November. In an interview with Yahoo Finance this week, Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the CDC, reiterated the timeline and asked public health systems to prepare for the eventuality.Although Slaoui told NPR Friday that November was \u201cextremely unlikely, but not impossible,\u201d Hahn said in an interview with Texas radio station WTAW that it is up to the companies to apply for an emergency use authorization (EUA). Ultimately, the FDA must review and subsequently approve a vaccine.\u201cWe are internally preparing for receiving those data, because we want to be able to act with appropriate speed,\u201d Hahn said, noting he is aware Pfizer\u2019s CEO has committed to providing results by October for regulatory review.Story continuesScrutiny of Russia\u2019s vaccine intensifiesWashington and South Dakota are seeing spikes in cases. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)As the worldwide race for a coronavirus cure heats up, results of Russia\u2019s vaccine candidate, dubbed \u201cSputnik V,\u201d have been published in The Lancet medical journal. The data provide some validation for the country\u2019s push to distribute the vaccine prior to a Phase 3 trial.The early-stage non-randomized trial painted an optimistic picture about the candidate\u2019s efficacy, based on no adverse events seen from the use of the vaccine.Still, more robust data using a control group in Phase 3 is needed, experts say. President Vladimir Putin previously stated that one of his daughters used the vaccine and the worst symptom was a slight fever\u2014 a common side effect of vaccines.Matthew Schmidt, a Russia expert at the University of New Haven, said on Friday that \u201cby circumventing the standard safety protocols of Phase III trials, and by politicizing the vaccine, the Kremlin has likely hurt public health globally, not helped it.\u201dThe encouraging data aside, \u201c...skirting established scientific protocols will likely buttress arguments of anti-vaccine proponents that all governments must be engaged in similar behavior to force vaccinations on people, and that they're hiding bad side effects for nefarious purposes,\u201d Schmidt added.Meanwhile, other experts still point to the level of antibody response. While the data has been deemed positive, Dr. Peter Hotez, Baylor College of Medicine's Dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine, told Yahoo Finance Friday the true effect of the vaccine will only be seen in Phase 3.The current results mirror the pre-clinical trial results for Oxford University and AstraZeneca\u2019s (AZN) vaccine candidate, Hotez said. That means that it follows the trend of the first round of vaccines being less effective than what may come later.\u201cThe Russian vaccine could meet the minimum...FDA criteria, but it may not be a vaccine that interrupts transmission. This may be true of early Operation Warp Speed vaccines too,\u201d Hotez said.But one positive is the dry-freeze form that the vaccine can be shipped in. That, Hotez said, is a key differentiator.The Russians have been good at dry-freezing vaccine, a skill developed in the development of a smallpox candidate that Russia and the U.S. collaborated on, Hotez said \u2014 which will help an inoculation reach some of the most remote parts of the world.Dr. Cindy Prins, an epidemiology professor at University of Florida, also pointed to the benefits that a vaccine stable at room temperature can provide many parts of the world.The two vaccine front-runners \u2014 Moderna (MRNA), and Pfizer (PFE) with BioNTech (BNTX)\u2014 have spurred hopes for a new and quicker vaccine development process in the future. Yet only one, Novavax (NVAX), has provided a room-temperature stable option.The latter has received the highest funding award through Operation Warp Speed, and is important for more widespread use in the global market, even while the U.S. refuses to join global efforts through the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) COVAX program.More from Anjalee:Redfield: CDC 'preparing earnestly' for vaccine in November, DecemberIndia's tech giants navigate 'literally spiking' WFH demand, H1-B fears in coronavirus eraHow protests spurred Corporate America into action on race, inequalityRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube."}]}
