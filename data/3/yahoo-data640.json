The racial gap in homeownership between Black and white Americans, for instance, is worse now than it was in the 1960\u2019s.A report by the Urban Institute says that \u201cthe gap in the homeownership rate between black and white families in the US is bigger today than it was when it was legal to refuse to sell someone a home because of the color of their skin.\u201dThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development published a plan last August that critics say would make it harder to prove housing discrimination. Rather than allow plaintiffs to use statistical evidence to claim a developer or lender has policies that have a disparate impact on minorities, they would have to clear more hurdles and prove that those policies are \u201carbitrary, artificial and unnecessary.\u201dWith the recent spotlight shed on issues of racial discrimination, the National Association of Realtors and lenders, including Bank of America, have urged President Trump\u2019s administration to drop the plan.President Donald Trump listens as Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson speaks during a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House, Saturday, March 21, 2020, in Washington. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)\u201cWe have all heard the legitimate concerns that have been raised that the proposed rule could make it more difficult to ensure that the Fair Housing Act\u2019s protections and avenues of redress against unlawful discrimination are available to all Americans,\u201d wrote Bank of America Vice Chairman Anne Finucane to Deputy HUD Secretary Brian Montgomery on June 29.In an exclusive interview with Yahoo Finance, HUD Secretary Ben Carson responded to Bank of America\u2019s letter.\u201cI\u2019m very glad that Bank of America is interested in this issue. And you know, they could do a whole lot to improve the situation for minorities by rejoining the FHA\u2019s program for housing. FHA, as you know, is the largest backer of insurance for forward mortgages for minorities, for first-time homebuyers, doing over a million cases last year. Bank of America did about 2,200. So if they really want to have an impact, this is what they should be thinking about, rather than criticizing a program that they haven't even seen and don't know anything about,\u201d said Carson.Story continuesIn a statement to Yahoo Finance, Bank of America spokesperson Bill Halldin said, \"Bank of America is committed to fair lending and supporting communities of color. We look forward to continuing to work with Secretary Carson.\" The bank launched a $5 billion affordable homeownership initiative last year.Carson defended HUD\u2019s efforts to change the disparate impact standard. \u201cWhat people need to understand is it is so wide and so broad the way it is written, all it provides is permanent employment for lawyers,\u201d he said, referring to the rule as it was under President Obama with a lower bar to prove discrimination.In response to the announcement of the regulation change last year, the Center for Responsible Lending said in a statement: \u201cbacktracking on disparate impact theory will hurt borrowers\u2019 access to safe and affordable mortgage credit as well as hurt lenders\u2019 bottom line. Moreover, it will perpetuate racial homeownership rate gaps and wealth gaps, especially today\u2019s low Black homeownership rate that stands at 40.6 percent, which is lower than when the Fair Housing Act became law in 1968.\u201dHUD rejects criticism that its actions would weaken efforts to combat housing discrimination. \u201cIf anybody knows of discrimination cases in housing, please tell us, because we are on them like white on rice,\u201d said Carson.More from Sibile:Why Black patients receive worse care at the hospitalCost of Confederate symbols comes out of Black workers\u2019 paychecks: EPIThe upside of Trump\u2019s Fourth of July fireworksThe case for higher wages during coronavirus recessionMaster P on Aunt Jemima, Uncle Ben\u2019s: \u2018Those are not real people\u2019Find live stock market quotes and the latest business and finance news"}]}
