The S&P 500 closed out September lower by 3.9% for its first monthly loss since March, and its worst September since 2011.Still, the blue-chip index ended the quarter higher by 8.7% for its best third-quarter since 2010. The Nasdaq\u2019s 11% gain over the past three months was also its best third-quarter in a decade, with tech stocks rallying strongly over the summer before giving back some gains in September.Only the utilities sector clung to gains in the blue-chip index for September. The energy, communication services and information technology sectors were the laggards, as a month-long correction in previously high-flying tech names took out these sectors\u2019 leadership positions.And with five weeks to go until Election Day, market pundits have warned of a potential for additional volatility conjured up by political uncertainty, compounded with ongoing concerns over the coronavirus pandemic and strain still facing the US economy.\u201cI think markets are really nervous into those 36 days [before the election] and one of the things we have to think about is, when does nervousness price in the worst is yet to come? When do you think the worst is priced in? At least from June to August highs, if you give up two-thirds of those gains \u2026 that would be 3,224 [on the S&P 500],\u201d Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of research, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe think that that\u2019s when you start to price in the worst, because you\u2019ve given up two-thirds of the rally that you\u2019ve had since June, and I think the world is better than it was since June.\u201dStory continuesDespite the pullback, Lee added he does not believe stocks are ultimately in a \u201cdown trend.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s still $4.3 trillion in cash on the sidelines. I don\u2019t think in the history of any financial market in the world do you ever have a top when there\u2019s 20% of the equity market sitting in cash,\u201d he said. \u201cInvestor cash \u2014 that\u2019s excluding the private equity cash, the record cash held by corporates too. So you\u2019ve got tons of dry powder. People are bearish.\u201dThe election also comes against a dire economic backdrop, especially in the labor market, with major corporations recently unveiling new rounds of job cuts. Disney (DIS) Tuesday said it was slashing 28,000 jobs \u2013 one of the largest sums during the Covid-19 era \u2013 among its theme parks, cruise lines and retail businesses, as each unit struggles with demand far below pre-pandemic levels. ADP\u2019s private payrolls report Wednesday morning topped estimates but showed fewer than 1 million jobs added back in September, as the pace of the economic recovery slows.To that end, congressional lawmakers and Trump administration negotiators have been attempting to come to a deal to pass in the near-term another virus relief bill. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Tuesday discussed the $2.2 trillion Democratic stimulus proposal, according to a Bloomberg report, and are poised to hold further talks again on Wednesday. Still, most economists and policy pundits are bracing for no new stimulus legislation to pass before the general election.\u20144:03 p.m. ET: S&P 500 ends Wednesday's session higher, but falls 3.9% in Sept. for first monthly loss since MarchHere were the main moves in markets as of 4:03 p.m. ET:S&P 500 (^GSPC): +27.43 (+0.82%) to 3,362.90Dow (^DJI): +329.70 (+1.20%) to 27,782.36Nasdaq (^IXIC): +82.26 (+0.74%) to 11,167.51Crude (CL=F): +$0.79 (+2.01%) to $40.08 a barrelGold (GC=F): -$10.80 (-0.57%) to $1,892.40 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): +3.2 bps to yield 0.6770%\u20142:44 p.m. ET: Stocks extend gains, Dow rises 300+ pointsThe three major indices advanced strongly Wednesday afternoon, led in the S&P 500 by the health-care, consumer staples and information technology sectors.Here were the main moves in markets, as of 2:44 p.m. ET:S&P 500 (^GSPC): +31.46 points (+0.94%) to 3,366.93Dow (^DJI): +338.55 points (+1.23%) to 27,791.21Nasdaq (^IXIC): +93.91 points (+0.85%) to 11,181.82Crude (CL=F): +$0.85 (+2.16%) to $40.14 a barrelGold (GC=F): -$6.30 (-0.33%) to $1,896.20 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): +3.1 bps to yield 0.676%\u20141:41 p.m. ET: Palantir opens for trading at $10 per share on the NYSEData software company Palantir (PLTR) opened for trading at $10 per share in its direct listing debut on the New York Stock Exchange.

Asana grew revenues by 63% over last year to $99.7 million during the six months ended July 31. The company\u2019s net loss, however, also widened over that period to $76.9 million from $30.5 million.\u201410:00 a.m. ET: Pending home sales soar to a record in AugustUS pending home sales surged by 8.8% in August, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) said Wednesday, far exceeding consensus estimates for a 3.1% monthly rise. The jump brought the level of the pending home sales index to 132.8, a record high.This marked the fourth straight monthly increase in pending home sales, with each of the four major US regions tracked by NAR posting steep gains.\"Tremendously low mortgage rates \u2013 below 3% \u2013 have again helped pending home sales climb in August,\" Lawrence Yun, NAR\u2019s chief economist, said in a statement. \"Additionally, the Fed intends to hold short-term fed funds rates near 0% for the foreseeable future, which should in the absence of inflationary pressure keep mortgage rates low, and that will undoubtably aid homebuyers continuing to enter the marketplace.\"\"While I did very much expect the housing sector to be stable during the pandemic-induced economic shutdowns, I am pleasantly surprised to see the industry bounce back so strongly and so quickly,\u201d Yun added.\u20149:50 a.m. ET: Stocks extend gains as Mnuchin strikes upbeat tone on stimulusThe three major indices rose further Wednesday morning, as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin suggested lawmakers were serious about trying to come to an agreement and pass a virus relief bill in the near-term.
