REUTERS/Jason Redmond\u2018Underfunded so dramatically\u2019The nursing home industry has been facing a financial shortfall since at least 2013, particularly for non-Medicare margins, according to the American Health Care Association (AHCA).Non-Medicare margins, which refer to \u201crevenues and costs associated with Medicaid and private payers for all lines of business,\u201d declined 3% in 2018, an increase from the year prior.Nursing home margins are declining. (Chart: AHCA)\u201cOver 60% of people in the country that live in nursing facilities are dependent upon Medicaid,\u201d AHCA President and CEO Mark Parkinson told Yahoo Finance. \u201cAnd unfortunately in most states, the Medicaid rates have been set at less than the actual cost to take care of the residents. So, it makes it very difficult to provide the kind of care that providers want when they\u2019re underfunded so dramatically.\u201dFurthermore, Parkinson added, \u201cmost of the people don\u2019t understand that Medicaid is really a middle-class benefit because if people live long enough to outlive their resources, it\u2019s the only way that they can afford to be taken care of in a facility.\u201dMedicaid is a federally-run program that provides health coverage to the elderly, pregnant women, children, people with disabilities, and eligible low-income adults. The federal government, though, allows states to set the payment amounts as long as they meet federal requirements.\u201cThe failure to adequately fund Medicaid is primarily a problem with the states,\u201d Parkinson said. \u201cEach state gets to make its own decision on what its reimbursement will be for Medicaid. Although the national average is around $200 a day, the rate varies dramatically by states, and some states are as low as less than $150 a day. In the low funding states, like Illinois and Texas, the politicians just haven\u2019t decided it\u2019s an important enough priority to adequately fund it.\u201dStory continuesRobyn Esaw sits in her a wheelchair in her room at Hammonton Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing amid the coronavirus outbreak in Hammonton, New Jersey. (Robyn Esaw/Handout via REUTERS)The coronavirus effectAccording to the New York Times analysis, \u201cthe virus has infected more than 282,000 people at some 12,000 facilities\u201d as of June 26 and killed more than 54,000. There are roughly 15,600 nursing homes in the U.S. with over 1.3 million residents and over 1.6 million staff members.\u201cIt\u2019s important to note that COVID hasn\u2019t discriminated so it\u2019s not just those worst-quality nursing homes that have seen cases,\u201d Grabowski said. \u201cIt\u2019s been equally apparent across the high quality and low quality facilities, high Medicaid and low Medicaid facilities. We\u2019ve found that it\u2019s really about where you\u2019re located that\u2019s driven these cases.\u201dAdding to the financial strain, testing for coronavirus in the thousands of nursing homes across the country can be extremely expensive: The AHCA and National Center for Assisted Living (NCAL) found that testing every U.S. nursing home resident and staff member just once would cost $440 million.There are over 2.4 million coronavirus cases in the U.S. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)And as the pandemic continues, more supplies are needed: A recent NCAL survey found that many assisted living communities are running low on PPE such as N95 masks, surgical face masks, face shields, gowns, and gloves.Grabowski stressed that \u201cyou really need those resources to manage the outbreak. And many nursing homes in this country lack that. They certainly lack the PPE and the testing to keep it out. But then once in there, they really lack the workforce to manage.\u201d\u2018A conscious political decision\u2019Why have these financial troubles received so little attention before and during the coronavirus pandemic? According to Parkinson, it\u2019s a \u201cfailure to recognize the importance of the elderly.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a conscious political decision to underfund elder care,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not defensible on any level, but it\u2019s occurring in the vast majority of states.\u201dAnthony Radzikowski visits his 95 year-old grandmother Ann Bradshaw at the Prospect House Assisted Living Facility where she lives and has been quarantined in Revere, Massachusetts. REUTERS/Brian SnyderGrabowski suggested that one way to put more dollars into Medicaid is by utilizing wage pass-through policies that pass money into the workforce.\u201cThere have been some instances with private equity-owned facilities or certain bad actors that haven\u2019t always put all of the dollars back into direct patient care,\u201d Grabowski said. \u201cSo I really think that\u2019s important that we earmark or direct those dollars to the caregiver.\u201dWith more funding, Parkinson noted, nursing homes can be better prepared for the next health crisis.\u201cIf we have adequate funding, we can rebuild nursing homes so that residents aren\u2019t sharing rooms,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s proven to be one of the real challenges of fighting the virus, is that you\u2019ve got people in shared rooms, which makes it very difficult to isolate those that develop symptoms of the virus. So there are a lot of things that can happen, but the fundamental thing is the policymakers just need to decide that the elderly are a priority.\u201dAdriana is a reporter and editor covering politics and health care policy for Yahoo Finance.
