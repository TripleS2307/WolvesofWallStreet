The new app, announced Monday at Apple\u2019s annual WWDC event, has special features that integrate with electric cars, making sure routes have enough charging stations to limit range worries.But above all, Apple is putting newfound privacy concerns first and foremost.Speaking at the WWDC event, held virtually due to the coronavirus crisis, Apple software engineering SVP Craig Federighi called it the \u201cbest way to explore the world,\u201d adding \u201call while protecting your privacy.\u201dThe obvious shot at Google\u2019s legendary powers of data collection \u2014 though one can opt out of much of it \u2014 was followed by Apple quoting a Fast Company article trumpeting it as a great app with a better privacy policy than Google.The revamp might get people who have tried Apple\u2019s Maps before to break their Google habit and try again. But Apple knows it will take features and integration with other aspects of Apple\u2019s iOS environment \u2014 like Siri and CarPlay \u2014 for many who don\u2019t see privacy issues.A new framework for privacyApple has leaned into its privacy policy over the past few years, looking to differentiate itself from Google and Facebook \u2014 and avoid bad press in the process.In many aspects of the new iOS and macOS, privacy is a bit more forward than it used to be. In Safari, a feature gives transparency about how websites track users \u2014 something that Apple hopes will convince people to stop using Google\u2019s Chrome. (They also said it was 50% faster than Chrome, because that is a factor that may sway more people.)Story continuesApple debuted new features for its Maps app at WWDC on June 22nd. (Apple)For apps asking for permissions, Apple is launching a nutritional facts-esque feature that shows what information the apps use. Permissions can also be given for a day, when in use, or forever, allowing for more control.Governing all this is Apple\u2019s message that privacy is a \u201cfundamental human right,\u201d as Federighi said. The company is using a few key principles as it considers how to use data: Not collecting any more data than is necessary, keeping it on-device and off the cloud, making security protections foundational, and keeping data usage and privacy transparent and controllable by users.Beyond its own apps, the company is expanding its privacy endeavors to other apps and services via its user accounts. Many companies use a \u201csign in with\u201d framework to make it easier to use new apps and services without creating new user accounts. Though Google, Amazon, and Facebook all have similar sign-ins, Apple\u2019s privacy-forward messaging may give Apple\u2019s version an advantage \u2014 as well as the fact that Apple Pay means the payments can also be integrated seamlessly.At WWDC, the company announced that the sign-in has been a major success, but that they would help people convert regular accounts to Apple sign-ins. For example, instead of logging into Kayak.com with your email and password, you can just log in with Apple, even if you already have an account with the travel agency.--Ethan Wolff-Mann is a writer at Yahoo Finance focusing on consumer issues, personal finance, retail, airlines, and more.
