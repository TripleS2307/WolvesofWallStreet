It also serves as further proof that Apple is leaning further into recurring revenue streams offered by subscription services as a means of ensuring the company\u2019s continued growth moving forward.Peloton under fireThe Apple Fitness+ service, which does not have a firm release date yet, will allow you to select the kinds of exercises you want to focus on \u2014 whether that\u2019s high intensity interval training, yoga, cycling, core exercises, treadmill workouts, and more. You\u2019ll also be able to choose the trainer you want to work with, the kind of music you\u2019re interested in, and workout duration.Apple on Tuesday announced it's launching its new Fitness+ service. And it's aiming directly at Peloton. (Image: Apple)Sound familiar? Peloton \u2014 which first launched internet-connected bicycles and treadmills and now features an app with an array of other exercise options \u2014 offers similar options in its own services, as do other apps. In fact, much of Peloton\u2019s appeal comes from the trainers who work with the service, and that\u2019s exactly what Apple hopes to pull off, as well.In the company\u2019s press announcement, it specifically says that Apple Fitness+ trainers have their own \u201cunique, inspirational story that transcends the screen.\u201d The company goes on to say that trainers are focused around a variety of exercise expertise whether that\u2019s professional athletes, personal trainers, health coaches, gymnasts and more.The idea is for the trainers to be the kind of people you want to work out with on a daily basis, just as Peloton\u2019s offerings do.Apple is even moving forward with a first-timer feature for Fitness+ called Absolute Beginner that\u2019s meant to provide users with the basics of workout movements and help them prepare for more advanced studio workouts.Story continuesApple Fitness+ is the company's first foray into fitness services, and will be available for $9.99 per month when it launches later this year. (Image: Apple)It\u2019s a smart idea, as it works to guide beginners away from starting on the hardest difficulty and becoming discouraged, which would lead them to cancel their subscription. It should also prevent users from hurting themselves by not following proper forms.It\u2019s all about the subscriptionsApple Fitness+ is just the latest in Apple\u2019s growing line of subscription services, and at $9.99 per month, it\u2019s also one of the pricier subscriptions the company offers. But it\u2019s also a solid value when compared to the $12.99 per month fee for Peloton\u2019s Digital Membership, and free with the bike.American ultramarathon runner and author Robin Arzon, a Peloton executive and instructor, poses for photos on the green carpet at the New York Jets New Uniform Unveiling on April 4, 2019 at Gotham Hall in New York, NY.

But it could get digital-only subscribers to change. Its availability on every iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV will also make it more appealing to users, as they won\u2019t have to download a separate app.Apple\u2019s subscription products are designed to keep Apple users in the company\u2019s ecosystem, ensuring that they\u2019ll both continue paying monthly fees, and, eventually, upgrade their iPhones and other Apple hardware as they become obsolete.The firm has been focusing on subscriptions more in recent years to help move away from its heavy reliance on iPhone sales. The company\u2019s Services arm is now its second largest behind the iPhone division, bringing in $13.2 billion in Apple\u2019s Q3 2020. The iPhone earned $26.4 billionWith the addition of Fitness+, Services is certain to grow even more.Got a tip?
