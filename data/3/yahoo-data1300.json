The protections for federally-held student loans were set to expire on September 30, as codified by the CARES Act.\u201cThank goodness,\u201d Betsy Mayotte of The Institute of Student Loan Advisors (TISLA) told Yahoo Finance. \u201cThis was the smartest thing to do for everyone involved.\u201d Mayotte added that \u201cthe relief that it provides is enormous, needed because we're not out of the woods yet.\u201dNot all consumer advocates were satisfied, particularly given that private student loans are not affected by this action.\u201cThere are 9 million borrowers who haven\u2019t received any help and it looks like they\u2019ll be left behind,\u201d Seth Frotman at the Student Borrower Protection Center told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing here is kicking the can down the road.\u201d(Graphic: David Foster)Frotman emphasized that \u201cwe still have tremendous number of Americans out of work, millions more struggling financially,\u201d adding: \u201cIt\u2019s not as if all our problems will be solved on January 1.\u201dMayotte echoed that sentiment, noting that \u201cmy fear is that Congress is going to feel like, well, we don't have anything left to do because the executive order did it, and that's not true.\u201d She added that Congress should first consider extending this action to other borrowers, and also loosen bankruptcy protections.Story continuesPresidential candidate Joe Biden\u2019s proposal may offer more relief to borrowers come January, if he were to be elected president. The former vice president\u2019s plan reportedly involves cancelling $10,000 in student loan debt for all 43 million federal student loan borrowers.\u201cYoung people and other student debt holders bore the brunt of the last crisis,\u201d Biden tweeted in March, as the pandemic began its brutal assault on the country. \u201cIt shouldn't happen again.\u201d\u2014Aarthi is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering education.
