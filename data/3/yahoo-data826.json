It\u2019s that functionality, which promises dramatically faster download and upload speeds, that analysts believe will lead to a so-called \u201csuper cycle\u201d during which a larger number of customers would upgrade their iPhones to the latest devices.Photo by: zz/STRF/STAR MAX/IPx 2020 7/19/20 Social distancing measures at The Apple Store on Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan on July 19, 2020 as certain restrictions are eased as part of the Phase 3 Reopening in New York City during the worldwide coronavirus pandemic. (NYC)Apple\u2019s iPhone line has been the key driver behind the company\u2019s success since its launch in 2007. And while sales numbers have been in decline from prior highs due to the saturation of the smartphone market, the tech giant posted a year-over-year increase in iPhone revenue in Q3 2020.[Read more: Apple earnings: Apple crushes Q3 expectations, announces 4-1 stock split]A delay in iPhone sales would have an impact on the company\u2019s Q4 2020 earnings. The phones typically launch in the latter half of September, and while they add a small amount to the quarter\u2019s overall iPhone revenue, the impact would likely be missed.Analysts were hoping Apple would provide some form of forward-looking guidance for the firm\u2019s Q4 revenue, but Cook and company demurred, saying that the economic environment created by the coronavirus pandemic would make it difficult for the company to provide anything beyond general color for the coming quarter.The news follows a massive quarter for Apple, which saw the company pull in $59.7 billion in revenue versus analysts\u2019 expectations of $52.3 billion. The firm saw iPhone revenue of $26.4 billion, Services revenue of $13.2 billion, and Accessories revenue of $6.5 billion.The day before issuing Apple\u2019s report, Cook sat before the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law to defend the company against accusations that it abuses its market power by requiring app developers to pay a 30% commission on apps sold through the App Store.Story continuesGot a tip?
