(AP: Rich Pedroncelli)Consumer advocates are dismayed by the decisions regarding ITT Tech, which maintained 130 locations across the U.S. before closing down in 2016.\u201cITT was a predatory and fraudulent company\u2026 On every front and by every metric, ITT was a scam,\u201d Toby Merrill, director of the Project on Predatory Lending, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cThe fact that the department is denying ITT students relief is unconscionable\u2026 it\u2019s just not right.\u201dMerill, whose project represents 750,000 former ITT students, said that the for-profit chain created $6 billion in student loan debt between 2006 and 2016.An ED spokesperson told Yahoo Finance that borrower defense claims \u201care not \u2018approved\u2019 or \u2018denied.\u2019 Borrowers are found to be eligible or ineligible for borrower defense relief. Though we can\u2019t comment on these specific cases, each borrower defense application is adjudicated fairly and in a manner that assures that students who have suffered financial harm are provided relief.\u201dApril 2020: \u2018This is total bunk\u2019 Joseph White, who attended an ITT Technical Institute in Missouri on-and-off from 2001 to 2008, ended up with an associate\u2019s degree and $30,000 in student loan debt.Story continuesAfter joining the military, White had attempted to pursue a bachelor's degree but said \u201chardly anybody would accept my ITT credits.\u201dHe returned to ITT to finish his bachelor's degree. And during the second enrollment, he became disturbed by some of the ITT staff\u2019s actions.According to White, even though he had submitted state tuition assistance to be applied towards his tuition, the funds were \u201cnot accounted for, or missing\u201d upon graduation. He also recalled being pressured to take out a private student loan, despite not wanting to hold them.ITT\u2019s career services department was also not much help while White was looking for a job. He said that they kept sending him job postings that looked like they were copied and pasted from a jobs site. Another former ITT student also reported the same experience.White, who is currently trying to buy a home, is worried that the burden will be \u201coverwhelming\u201d between his mortgage payments and student loan repayments.He had submitted a defense to repayment application in 2015, hoping to have his student loan debt discharged. His application was rejected on April 30.\u201cThis is total bunk. \u2026 Most of these denials look like they are processed using a spam bot,\u201d White told Yahoo Finance. \u201cI\u2019m utterly disgusted at the process. Dozens of other people who have been waiting for DTR responses have also been denied.\u201dDeVos under attack for borrower defense reversalThe so-called borrower defense rules were originally written into law through the Higher Education Act in the early 1990s and were meant to help victims of fraudulent schools seek relief.Under existing law, borrowers with federal loans are eligible for loan forgiveness if a college or a university has misled them or engaged in other misconduct in violation of certain state laws.After the Great Recession, enrollment at for-profit schools \u201cskyrocketed in the first decade of the period, nearly quadrupling between 2000 and 2011,\u201d according to the New York Fed.In 2015, after several for-profit colleges went extinct amid scandals, the Obama administration implemented regulations such that defrauded students who made a successful claim would be granted full debt relief.U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos durig a cabinet meeting in the East Room of the White House on May 19. (PHOTO: Alex Wong/Getty Images)Education Secretary Betsy DeVos modified that rule in 2019, making it tougher to access relief while alleging that the Obama administration had \u201cweaponized\u201d the regulations..\u201cWhen borrower defense arrived in 1995, it ... was little used\u2026 in the 20 years from 1995 to 2015, fewer than 60 claims were filed,\u201d she said during a previous hearing in front of the House Committee on Education and Labor. \u201cThen the previous administration weaponized the regulation against schools it simply didn\u2019t like. They applied the law in a discriminatory fashion. So since 2015, there has been a 5,000% increase in borrower defense claims.\u201dA political spat ensued: Congress rejected DeVos\u2019 new rules, tried to re-install Obama-era rules, which then passed the GOP-controlled Senate, only to be rejected by President Donald Trump.The House has signaled that it would attempt to override the veto.Meanwhile, DeVos has been the subject of multiple lawsuits on the issue as well, from consumer advocates, aside from lawmakers who decried her reversal.From left, Sen.

She decided to attend ITT after seeing her brother successfully graduate from it.But the experience, particularly with the financial aid office, was confusing.\u201cHow much did I borrow? How many dollars in grants? I didn\u2019t know any of that,\u201d Say recalled. \u201cThey didn\u2019t provide me receipts.\u201dAfter she left ITT, Say said she had filed for her debt to be discharged since she was disabled. After a few years, the debt was finally discharged, only to be reinstated by Sallie Mae around \u201cthe same time that ITT got bombarded by Obama and forced to close,\u201d Say said. She is now a few months into a new disability discharge application with Nelnet.Say submitted a borrower defense application, aside from the disability discharge, when \u201cObama was still president,\u201d hoping to have her student loan debt discharged. Her application was rejected on May 20.\u201cIt was a total shock that I got rejected, a total shock,\u201d Say said.U.S. President Barack Obama (C) signs the Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act of 2013 on August 9, 2013 in Washington, DC.

She owes $13,000 in student loan debt.After graduating from high school, Thompson was working odd jobs when she saw an ad for ITT.\u201cThey followed up with me constantly... and as the interview process went on, they were more than happy to get me signed up,\u201d Thompson told Yahoo Finance.In hindsight, Thompson noted, there were some actions ITT took that puzzled her. When she was taking out grants for the school, the school told her she needed a co-signer. When her dad, who was just out of jail, offered to be her co-signer, \u201cthey even let him sign for me,\u201d she recalled. \u201cThat\u2019s how desperate they were to get me in there.\u201dThompson said that things got worse once she started school. \u201cSome of the projects I had carried out were just complete garbage,\u201d she said. Even though she was studying graphic design, she wasn\u2019t even given access to Photoshop. She was pointed to a free website to download fonts, called DaFont, to practice.\u201cI had no idea that ITT was a for-profit college,\u201d she said. \u201cThey never said that.\u201dThe Chantilly Campus of ITT Technical Institute sits closed and empty on Tuesday, September 6, 2016, in Chantilly, VA. (Photo: Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post via Getty Images)After a few months, Thompson felt like there was nothing to gain from staying, so she quit. But she couldn\u2019t walk away entirely: \u201cI pretty much just got saddled with the debt.\u201dThompson filed an application for debt relief in 2016 \u2014 which she said was like a \u201cRubik\u2019s cube\u201d and a \u201ctotal mess\u201d \u2014 hoping that she would receive at least partial relief on the debt she owed for a degree she didn\u2019t even receive. Her application was rejected on June 9.\u201cThey\u2019re just shoveling them out the door,\u201d she said. \u201cI have tried really hard. We\u2019ve paid off almost all of our medical debt, all of our consumer debt.\u201dThompson worried about her child, bills, and medical expenses. She had to cross state lines for her daughter's medical appointments, traveling all the way to Charlotte, since she lived in a rural area.\u201cI am so angry and disappointed,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like I made a mistake 10 years ago, going to that school, thinking that I was going to learn something and do something.\u201d\u2014Aarthi is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering consumer finance and education.
