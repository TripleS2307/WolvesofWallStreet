It\u2019s unclear how big that will be, but we need to be prepared.\u201dCoronavirus is surging in southern U.S. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)\u2018We ... need to double down on preventative care\u2019There have been fears of a second wave since the virus first began spreading in the U.S. at the end of January. Public health officials warned that a resurgence in the fall was a possibility and could pose a significant threat combined with flu season.\u201cHere in Massachusetts and in New York, we\u2019ve been able to beat back a surge effectively,\u201d Santiago said. \u201cI worked every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, every week during the surge here for the past four months and we\u2019re in a place now where we feel comfortable moving forward.\u201dSantiago stated that over the past weekend while working an ER shift, he encountered two patients who had visited loved ones down South and tested positive for the virus after returning to Massachusetts.\u201cThere are no borders between states,\u201d he noted. \u201cWe have to be incredibly vigilant and careful, and need to double down on preventative care \u2026 if we\u2019re ever going to get through this.\u201dCoronavirus cases are continuing to rise outside of New York. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)\u2018We really need to double down on behavior change\u2019This is why, Santiago stressed, it\u2019s more important than ever to remain vigilant.\u201cRight now, even in the state of Massachusetts, it\u2019s really hard for me to fathom that there\u2019s a political will right now to really go back to a complete shutdown,\u201d he said. \u201cSo as we open up \u2014 we just went to phase three, that\u2019s the gyms and museums and some indoor dining \u2014 the community and the economy, we really need to double down on behavior change, mask wearing, self-quarantining, even from folks who are visiting the state.\u201dStory continuesPeople seen walking on the beach side walk some wearing mask and some not wearing a face mask on July 06, 2020 in Miami Beach, Florida. (Photo by Johnny Louis/Getty Images)Most states have implemented mandatory face mask wearing for those venturing outdoors or entering public indoor places. Experts have said that mask wearing is a critical part of containing the spread of the virus.\u201cJust a couple of days ago, I filed a legislation to mandate face covering when you enter outdoor places in Massachusetts,\u201d Santiago said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need that across this whole country. The fact that it\u2019s been politicized from our most important leaders up and down is concerning to me. We need to get to a place where we\u2019re practicing social distancing, good hygiene, and mask wearing. Because in lieu of a vaccine, that\u2019s all we have right now.\u201dPeople in Domino Park are seen in circles painted as guidelines for social distancing during the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Brooklyn.

Again, without a vaccine, without all the care and treatment that we have out there, we need to move forward with testing and proper surveillance and contact tracing, something we started in Massachusetts.\u201dContact tracing is a practice used by health departments to track those who have come into contact with an infectious disease (in this case, coronavirus) and the people those came into contact with.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks holding his facemask during a press conference to address the rise of coronavirus cases in the state, at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami. (Photo by CHANDAN KHANNA/AFP via Getty Images)\u201cWhat we have going on in Florida, California, and Texas is very concerning and my guess is in the next week or so, you\u2019ll see the associated hospitalizations and the deaths begin to rise with a level of new infections that we\u2019re already seeing,\u201d Santiago said.\u201cWe\u2019re operating weeks, months after the fact,\u201d he added. \u201cThese states down South and in the West, we should have been more proactive putting the resources in place as a public health crisis and not so much a political one.\u201dAdriana is a reporter and editor covering politics and health care policy for Yahoo Finance.
