But for the first time, one of the biggest residential construction companies in the U.S., KB Home (KBH), will offer dedicated home office construction, the company announced Wednesday morning.KB Home joins a slew of smaller architects and builders that are custom designing spaces for work-from-home trends. Los Angeles-based architecture firm HKS, Chicago-based design firm Gensler and French-Moroccan architectural design practice Studio Belem are among the firms that have adapted, according to reports.\u201cThe work from home phenomenon was already growing, but COVID accelerated it \u2014 and some companies have announced that certain employees can work from home permanently. It changes the dynamic of having to trod into the office every day,\u201d said KB Home CEO Jeff Mezger, adding that the custom-home builder began working on the KB Home Office package in April.The KB Home Office will include a built-in workstation and shelving.

Homeowners can also work with KB Home\u2019s design studio to add soundproofing, custom lighting, a half-bath, extra windows, a built-in coffee bar or even a private patio to their home office.\u201cPeople have asked about it in the past, but it was more aspirational,\u201d said Mezger, who explained that a dedicated office space is important because it\u2019s \u201ctough to put in electrical upgrades after the home is built.\u201dThe KB Home Office will cost about $2,000 to $3,000 \u2014 or $12 to $15 a month. Images provided by KB Home.The Los Angeles builder\u2019s home office option comes as the U.S. shifts to a semi-permanent work-from-home model. Some 54% of Americans worked from home during the coronavirus pandemic, and it\u2019s becoming clear that at least some of the shift to remote work will be permanent, said Mezger.Google announced Monday that most of its employees could continue working from home until June 2021, joining Twitter, Square and Facebook in semi-permanent work-from-home commitments. And three-fourths of CFOs say some employees will continue to work from home after the pandemic, according to a survey of over 300 CFOs by Gartner, a Connecticut-based research and advisory firm.Story continues\u201cWe are seeing homebuyers purchasing larger homes and wanting private places to work, or for their kids to do homework. Buyers are mentioning that more. I think it\u2019ll be a big thing for the consumer,\u201d said Mezger.Sarah Paynter is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
