While the official Census data for business formation for the third quarter will be published on Oct. 14, the Census reported a total of 97,190 business applications for the week ending Sept. 19, representing a 45.1% year-over-year jump. Looking back at the second quarter data, total business applications reached an all-time high of 883,174 applications.There has been a surge in new business applications in the U.S. Source: Goldman SachsThere\u2019s another optimistic sign: \u201chigh-propensity to succeed\u201d business applications \u2014 or those that are best positioned to survive \u2014 reached their highest quarterly level on record for the third quarter, after seeing virus-related declines in March and April.The authors describe this economic crisis as markedly different from the 2008-2009 recession, specifically laying out the two major reasons this is the case.\u201cFirst, the monetary and fiscal policy responses were much more aggressive than usual, easing financial conditions and provided a catalyst for self-employment given new work from home arrangements. Second, the pandemic has provided many opportunities for new types of businesses.\u201dThe latest recession has created opportunities for new businesses.

Airbnb and Groupon (GRPN) were founded in 2008. WhatsApp (FB), Uber (UBER), Slack (WORK), Venmo (PYPL), and Square (SQ) were created the following year, becoming some of the most successful and ubiquitous companies in the world, particularly during a digital-forward stay-at-home-centered economy.Story continuesFormer Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel (echoing Winston Churchill, who first used the phrase after World War II) said, \u201cNever allow a good crisis go to waste. It\u2019s an opportunity to do the things you once thought were impossible.\u201d He repurposed the sentiment in March, attempting to galvanize government officials early on in the pandemic.\u201cThis pandemic is actually inducing a surge in employer business startups that takes us back to the days before the decline in the Great Recession,\u201d John Haltiwanger, a University of Maryland economist, told The Wall Street Journal recently.\u201dOf course, not all firms are created equal. Applications include those who are self-employed or freelance for their main source of income. More Americans, perhaps those who were laid off or furloughed, have taken to freelancing or working for themselves during this time of crisis.Goldman couches the positive news on business formation with an important caveat: \u201cSome of the surge in recent business applications likely reflects \u2018pent-up\u2019 applications from a backlog due to statewide closures in the early stages of the pandemic.\u201dMelody Hahm is Yahoo Finance\u2019s West Coast correspondent, covering entrepreneurship, technology and culture.
