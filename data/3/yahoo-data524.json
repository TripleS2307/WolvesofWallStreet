Assessing Team Trump\u2019s claims about Biden and China", "body": "As the head-to-head matchup between Donald Trump and Joe Biden takes shape, the president and his allies have unleashed a range of charges about Biden\u2019s record on China.They\u2019ve leveled a series of charges \u2013 many of which they recently cut into a television advertisement \u2013 and have even tried to start a #BeijingBiden hashtag.In an interview with Yahoo Finance Trump economic advisor Peter Navarro added a few more claims during the wide-ranging interview.Many of the statements from Navarro and his colleagues are not backed up by the facts or lack crucial context.The move is part of a strategy shift by Trump and his allies to run against China and its handling of the coronavirus crisis just months after touting the Phase 1 trade deal. Senate Republicans are taking a similar tack.A screengrab from a recent Trumnp campaign advertisement attacking Joe Biden over his record on China.In the early stages of the pandemic, Trump tweeted and repeatedly praised China. \u201cWe\u2019ve developed an incredible relationship,\u201d Trump said in January. About four months later, his tone had shifted: the U.S. \u201cwants an open and constructive relationship,\u201d he said, but China has violated its promises.Here\u2019s some of Team Trump\u2019s more notable claims against Biden and some context often left out.Claims that Biden has never stood up to China on trade\u201cChina never gave our country anything. China gave us nothing. Not 10 cents. And whether it was Biden in charge of China, which was a joke because he ripped off \u2013 they ripped off our country for eight years.\u201d - President Trump on May 1\u201cPeople are going to have a very clear choice between Joe Biden, who for the last 30 years or more, has been a client of China and helped oversee the export of our manufacturing jobs. He never said a word about intellectual property theft, forced technology transfer, sweatshop labor, or pollution havens or currency manipulation.\u201d - Peter Navarro on June 11\u201c[Biden] has no track record at all on standing up to China and our other enemies.\u201d - Larry Kudlow on June 5The overarching claim from Trump\u2019s re-election effort is that Biden\u2019s record shows he is \u201cweak\u201d on the issue.Story continuesOver his nearly 50-year political career, Biden has indeed generally been supportive of free-trade agreements with China and other countries. He has repeatedly pushed for closer relations between the U.S. and China.He described the two countries as \u201cgood friends\u201d in a 2011 speech and said \u201ca rising China is a positive, positive development, not only for China but for America and the world writ large.\u201dAs FactCheck.org put it, \u201cwhile it is true that Biden has said quite positive things about China and its people, so, too, has Trump.\u201dAs Vice President, Joe Biden forged a relationship with then-Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Biden has also spoken about ensuring that human rights and labor provisions are present in various trade deals. One of his key criticisms of Trump\u2019s \u201cPhase 1\u201d deal was that it didn\u2019t impose enough restrictions on things like China\u2019s \u201cillegal and unfair trade practices.\u201dThe Biden campaign has cast his long experience as an asset, saying it will be an advantage in office. Biden says he would only re-enter the Trans-Pacific-Partnership after renegotiating it to make sure \u201cenvironmentalists are there and labor is there.\u201d\u201cEither China\u2019s going to write the rules of the road for the 21st century on trade or we are,\u201d he said.In the Senate, Biden voted to approve things like Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China in 2000. In other votes, he has opposed trade deals without what he saw as sufficient environmental and labor standards.Think tanks have offered a range of analyses of what a Biden trade policy might look like.What Biden said after Trump banned Chinese travel in January\u201cThey called me a racist. They said \u2018xenophobic.\u2019 Biden said, \u2018He was xenophobic.\u2019 Biden has now written a letter of apology because I did the right thing.\u201d - Trump on May 4Sleepy Joe Biden (mostly his reps.) went crazy when I banned, in late January, people coming in from China. He called me \u201cxenophobic\u201d & then went equally \u201cnuts\u201d when we let in 44,000 people - until he was told they were American citizens coming home. He later apologized!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 25, 2020This is another claim that has been pulled apart by fact-checkers. Biden did talk about Trump\u2019s \u201cxenophobia\u201d shortly after the administration announced the travel restrictions, but he didn\u2019t mention the travel bans specifically in the remarks.\"You know we have right now a crisis with the coronavirus, emanating from China,\" Biden reportedly said at an event on Jan. 31, adding that this \u201cis no time for Donald Trump\u2019s record of hysteria and xenophobia \u2013 hysterical xenophobia \u2013 and fear-mongering to lead the way instead of science.\"We are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus. We need to lead the way with science \u2014 not Donald Trump\u2019s record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering. He is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency.\u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) February 1, 2020The Biden campaign says that the reference \u201cwas about Trump\u2019s long record of scapegoating others\u201d and not specifically about the travel ban. On April 3, the Biden campaign announced that the former Vice President supported Trump\u2019s decision to impose travel restrictions on China.There\u2019s also no evidence that Biden delivered any sort of \u201capology\u201d as Trump has repeatedly claimed. The Biden campaign has denied that any letter exists.Hunter Biden and China\u201cBeijing Biden\u2019s son Hunter penned a $1.5 billion deal with a Chinese investment fund to make $80,000 per month from China in the months leading up to the coronavirus outbreak.\u201d - A voicemail reportedly left for voters from the Republican National CommitteeHunter Biden \u201cgot 1.5 Billion Dollars from China despite no experience and for no apparent reason.\u201d - Trump, October 2019Trump and his allies have been making charges about Hunter Biden\u2019s actions in China since before the pandemic to say that his father\u2019s record in dealing with the country is corrupt.Vice President Biden arrives in Beijing during a 2013 trip with his granddaughter Finnegan Biden and his son Hunter Biden. (REUTERS/Ng Han Guan/Pool)Factcheck.org took a look at the phone message and found that it\u2019s \u201cwrong in some respects and misleading in others.\u201d Hunter Biden was indeed involved in the formation of a private equity fund with Chinese firms. The fund held $1.5 billion in total \u2013 any profit that Hunter Biden received were surely far less. The deal also occurred in 2014, long before the current pandemic.China has also rejected Trump\u2019s calls to investigate Biden.Most importantly, for Biden\u2019s actual record on dealing with China, Factcheck.org found \u201cno evidence that Joe Biden used his position as vice president to enrich his son.\u201dA claim about Biden and China and space\u201cContrast that with Joe Biden, who, the last time he ran for president, said that he wanted China to be a full partner in space exploration. And we just know that, under President Trump, the United States is not going to take a backseat to anybody, and certainly will not bring China along for the ride.\u201d -- Trump Campaign Communications Director Tim Murtaugh on May 27This one is true. Then-Sen. Biden was quoted in 2008 talking about China and space in the magazine Nature.Space is an issue that Biden has not talked extensively about during his career but he did praise the SpaceX launch last month.Today, in lifting our ambitions and our imaginations to the heavens, the United States has once more reshaped the future of space travel. https://t.co/AskxceOJJU\u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) May 30, 2020Biden as \u2018the most traveled Vice President to China in American history\u2019\u201cJoe Biden, who, you know, basically lived out of a post office box in Delaware where multinational corporations sent our jobs freely offshore, many of them to China. By his travel logs in the White House, he was the most traveled Vice President to China in American history by factors of 2 or 3 or more.\u201d - Peter Navarro on June 11This claim \u2013 from Navarro\u2019s Yahoo Finance interview \u2013 appears to be a new one.The idea that Biden \u201cbasically lived out of a post office box\u201d makes little sense at any point in Biden\u2019s career. During the pandemic, he\u2019s been criticized for not leaving his home in Delaware enough.As recently as last week, Trump tweeted about Biden\u2019s \u201csanctuary\u201d in Wilmington. Also, during his 30-plus years in the Senate, Biden was known as \u201cAmtrak Joe\u201d for his habit of riding the train home each night to Delaware.Biden did, indeed, live in Washington during his time as vice president. He lived at the official residence of the vice president, just like other VPs, including Mike Pence. He also reportedly rented a home in Northern Virginia for a stretch after leaving the vice presidency.On the claim that Biden is the \u201cmost traveled Vice President to China in American history,\u201d the truth is much less dramatic than Navarro might make it sound.Vice President Biden inside the Great Hall of the People in China in December 2013. (Lintao Zhang-Pool/Getty Images)As VP, Biden appears to have traveled to China twice in 8 years. He visited in August 2011 and then again in December 2013. The second trip \u2013 which included his son Hunter \u2013 is one that Trump\u2019s allies are now scrutinizing.Other vice presidents, like Dick Cheney, have visited the country as part of their duties. Cheney visited in 2004. Mike Pence gave a closely watched speech on China in 2018 but doesn\u2019t appear to have traveled there during his time in office.The White House did not respond to requests to clarify Navarro\u2019s comments.Ben Werschkul is a producer for Yahoo Finance in Washington, D.C.Read more:\u2018Trump time\u2019: Peter Navarro says the manufacturing of a coronavirus vaccine will be swift\u2018I actually would be tougher\u2019: A Democrat's plan for changing the relationship with China after TrumpWhy Trump is moving closer to punishing China for the coronavirusRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn,YouTube, and reddit."}]}
