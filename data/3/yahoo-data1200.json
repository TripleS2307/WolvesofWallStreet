An advocacy group for major tech companies, the Center for Democracy and Technology, brought a lawsuit against the Trump administration calling the order an infringement on free speech.Story continuesDespite the controversy, Ballmer said the problem of misinformation poses less of a challenge to regulators and industry than some observers believe.\u201cI think it's easier than people think,\u201d he says.Lessons from the 2016 electionConcerns about misinformation on social media reached a fever pitch after the 2016 presidential election, the outcome of which some have attributed to a Russian disinformation campaign. The following year, Ballmer founded USAFacts, a nonprofit organization that curates and distributes publicly available government data.Ballmer made the remarks in an episode of Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cInfluencers with Andy Serwer,\u201d a weekly interview series with leaders in business, politics, and entertainment.Scrutiny of big tech companies in Washington, D.C., escalated last year, when the U.S. House Judiciary Committee held the first in a series of antitrust hearings about whether and how to address the concentration of market power in big tech.Steve Ballmer, the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers and former Microsoft CEO, appears on \"Influencers with Andy Serwer.\"Several Democratic presidential candidates, most prominently Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, called last year for the breakup of tech giants. The Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department have divided up oversight of Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), and Facebook.The tech industry should prioritize innovative solutions to misinformation with a focused approach similar to that of pharmaceutical companies in response to the coronavirus, says Ballmer.\u201cThere is innovation right now in the pharma industry that is all targeted clearly on corona[virus],\u201d he says. \u201cThere is a clear priority that helps focus innovation \u2014 and if there were clear priorities in terms of, of privacy and appropriate expression, I think the social media companies will innovate in a way that will really improve the situation quickly.\u201d\u201cRight now, the innovation is not being applied in as perfect a way as it could if there was a more clear target,\u201d he says.Read more:Michael Dell: \u2018Not enough\u2019 progress on diversity in the tech industryBusiness leaders fear 'flaming on social media' if they criticize Trump: Fast Company Editor-in-ChiefMelinda Gates: Some governors are \u2018moving too fast\u2019 to reopen their states\u2018We may need to quarantine our books' when libraries reopen, New York Public Library CEO saysRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"}]}
