Gundlach said he\u2019s come across data suggesting that about \"two-thirds of conservatives or moderate conservatives say that they have lied about their support for Donald Trump either directly or by omission.\"\"I just think there's a lot, a lot of time here. There's going to be twists and turns,\" Gundlach added.For markets, he expects \"significant\" volatility, usually the case close to a presidential election.\"This go-around, I expect much greater volatility around the election as the progressive policies, so-called, of tremendous increased deficit spending for basically wealth manipulation, that could get pretty heated, and we'll see what happens.\"On Tuesday, Biden announced Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., as his vice-presidential running mate.Later on the call, Gundlach said he didn't think Harris was a \"good pick,\" adding that Harris is \"maybe a little too charismatic.\"\"She might be a little bit dominant with her personality, but I don't have any particular thoughts on Kamala Harris. I'm not surprised that she's the pick.\"Julia La Roche is a Correspondent for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on Twitter.
