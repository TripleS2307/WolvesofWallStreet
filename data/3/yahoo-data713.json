New jobless claims improved to a pandemic-era low of 1.19 million, but still held above the 1 million mark for a twentieth consecutive week.The print, however, followed a sharp miss in ADP\u2019s National Employment Report on Wednesday, which showed that private employers added back just 167,000 jobs in July, where 1.2 million had been expected. It also came a day ahead of the Labor Department\u2019s official July jobs report, set for release Friday morning.A mixed picture of economic improvement in the U.S., especially in the labor market, has added urgency for Congress to convene on a new stimulus bill to support those affected by widespread virus-related joblessness. Discussions are set to continue in Washington, though lawmakers on both sides of the aisle appear locked in a stalemate on key issues. President Donald Trump said Thursday he was working on an executive order to implement some of the key measures himself.\u201cFiscal stimulus that supported the economy during the first half of the year is wearing off and it\u2019s unclear whether Congress will be able to provide more fiscal support, but for now markets continue to price that another stimulus package is a done deal,\u201d Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management, said in an email Wednesday.Meanwhile, quarterly earnings reports ahead of the opening bell Thursday came in mixed.

Meanwhile, Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT) posted an even wider than expected loss, and saw its revenue per available room slide 81% over last year as consumers eschewed travel during the pandemic.Story continuesAfter market close Wednesday, a handful of smaller-cap tech companies report results that handily topped consensus estimates. Etsy (ETSY), which has benefited from an influx of consumers turning to online shopping, saw a 137% surge in in second-quarter revenue. Gross merchandise sales jumped 146%, and even in absence of face mask sales jumped 93% over last year.Roku (ROKU) also posted estimates-topping top-line results, with sales up 42% as active customers climbed by nearly the same margin to 43 million.

Still, it was the twentieth straight week that claims remained troublingly elevated at more than 1 million.Here\u2019s what some economists told Yahoo Finance about the latest print on the labor market:\u201cThe pressure is coming off just slightly in the labor markets with unemployment claims coming down from recent highs. But we cannot be sure or not if this is good news for the recovery or whether it is the lapse in those $600 weekly checks from the federal government that is now a disincentive for some newly jobless workers to file. There are anecdotal reports that some states are tightening the eligibility requirements for unemployment benefits where jobless workers need to aggressively search for new employment opportunities to continue to receive assistance.\u201d \u2014 Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist for MUFG Union Bank\u201cThough the non-seasonally adjusted number of initial unemployment claims dropping is a positive sign, the pain of the coronavirus crisis is still being felt deeply throughout the labor market ... On top of all of this, the $600 expanded federal unemployment benefit has expired. In June, this $600 add-on accounted for 5.2% of all disposable income. This expiration means unemployed people\u2019s incomes will now fall at a time when they already are struggling to pay bills and find work.\u201d \u2014 AnnElizabeth Konkel, Indeed Hiring Lab director of economic research\u201cWith the trajectory of the recovery still unclear, today\u2019s numbers highlight the uncertainty in the labor market. And with stimulus talks in Washington still volleying for an answer to the unemployment problem, the future is clouded. While any positive momentum is definitely welcomed, let\u2019s keep in mind we\u2019re still far way from pre-pandemic levels.\u201d \u2014 Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy for E-Trade Financial\u20149:35 a.m. ET: Stocks open flat after jobless claims dataHere were the main moves in markets, as of 9:35 a.m. ET:S&P 500 (^GSPC): -3.1 points (-0.09%) to 3,324.67Dow (^DJI): +5.56 points (+0.02%) to 27,207.08Nasdaq (^IXIC): -9.85 points (-0.08%) to 10,990.93Crude (CL=F): +$0.30 (+0.71%) to $42.49 a barrelGold (GC=F): +$21.20 (+1.03%) to $2,070.50 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): -2.3 bps to yield 0.52%\u20148:30 a.m. ET: Jobless claims better than expected, yet still bleakWith all signs pointing to a loss of momentum in the economic recovery, 1.1 million people filed initial claims in the latest week.
