Reach me on Twitter at @danielhowley or email me at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.Now, on to your questions. This week's dilemma:\u201cWhat\u2019s the best tech to take to the beach or pool?\u201dIt\u2019s summertime, and if you\u2019re able to get to the beach, or just want to hangout at your backyard pool, there are plenty of gadgets that you\u2019ll likely want to bring along with you. But water and sand don\u2019t really mix very well with our favorite tech toys.Thankfully, there are still a number of speakers, headphones, and e-readers out there that can handle taking a dip, and more, and keep on ticking. These are some of the top gadgets you can take on your trip to the beach or the pool.Waterproof speaker \u2014 UE Wonderboom 2The UE Wonderboom 2 is a waterproof speaker than can float and withstand drops of up to 5 feet. (Image: UE)Ultimate Ears\u2019 (LOGI) Wonderboom 2 speaker costs you $99 and promises up to 13 hours of battery life from its compact design, though The Wirecutter says it\u2019s more like 8 hours. Waterproof and dust proof, the circular speaker is buoyant enough to float in your pool, so you don\u2019t have to worry about taking a dive to grab it if it slips in.UE says the Wonderboom 2 can survive drops as high as 5 feet, meaning even if it takes a tumble, it\u2019ll keep rocking.If you\u2019re looking for something more powerful, and expensive, you can also opt for the Sonos Move. Starting at $399, the Move can handle dust and mists of water, but you can\u2019t submerge it like the Wonderboom 2. But if you want impressive audio, and have the money to burn, the Move is a solid option.Water resistant earbuds \u2014 AirPods ProApple's AirPods Pros are both sweat and water resistant, making them great for listening while laying out in the sun. (Image: Apple)If you just want to relax at the pool, or on the sand, and, like me, don\u2019t want everyone around you to hear your awful taste in music, you\u2019ll want to get a pair of water resistant headphones. And for my money, the best pair around are Apple\u2019s (AAPL) AirPods Pro. At $249, they\u2019re a bit pricey, but the performance and sound quality are fantastic.Story continuesAnd if you\u2019re tired of listening to the couple 6 feet away chatting it up, you can use the Pros\u2019 noise-cancelling technology to drown them out.It\u2019s worth keeping in mind that the AirPods Pros are sweat and water resistant and not waterproof. So they\u2019ll handle your sweat from working out or hanging out in the sun, but don\u2019t douse them in water or take them swimming.E-reader \u2014 Kindle PaperwhiteThe Kindle Paperwhite can with withstand being dropped in up to 6 feet of water for an hour, and keep ticking. That's way better than your old paperback. (Image: Amazon)Want to relax with a good book while catching some rays, but don\u2019t want to lug around a heavy hardcover with the rest of your beach gear? Amazon\u2019s (AMZN) Kindle Paperwhite is what you\u2019re looking for. Starting at $129 with 8GB of storage or $159 with 32GB of space, the Paperwhite can be used in direct sunlight thanks to its adjustable display, and it is surprisingly waterproof.Amazon says the e-reader can last up to an hour in 6.5 feet of fresh water without calling it quits but doesn\u2019t say anything about salt water, so try to keep it on your beach blanket and out of the ocean.Phone case \u2014 LifeProof FR\u0112The LifeProof Fre can take water, snow, and serious falls. (Image: LifeProof)Most of today\u2019s smartphones are already waterproof, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily make them capable of surviving a drop in the sand or a dip in salt water. If you\u2019re the more adventurous type and want to use your phone in the ocean to capture underwater snaps or simply don\u2019t want to deal with sand getting into your device, you can always opt for a case like the LifeProof FR\u0112.Available for $74.99, the FR\u0112 can help your phone survive in up to 6 feet of water for an hour, withstand drops, dirt, and more. I\u2019ve used a FR\u0112 case to take underwater shots in a pool, and it worked incredibly well. Taking my phone into the ocean, though, is too much of a risk for me.Fitness tracker \u2014 Apple Watch or Fitbit Versa 2The Apple Watch can function in water as deep as 150 feet, even in the ocean. (Image: Apple)If you\u2019re the kind of person who likes to exercise at the pool or beach, we probably wouldn\u2019t be friends. But that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t be able to track your exercises with a waterproof smart watch. Both the Apple Watch and Fitbit\u2019s (FIT) Versa 2 are waterproof and can be used to track your swim in a pool or the ocean.The Apple Watch Series 3 starts at $199, while the Series 5 starts at $399. The Versa 2 starts at $199. The decision comes down to your personal preference for styling and functionality. Either way, you\u2019ll still be able to record your aquatic workouts, while I lie out in the sun sipping my pi\u00f1a colada from a red Solo cup so the lifeguards don\u2019t notice.Got a tip?
