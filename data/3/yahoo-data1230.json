Jordan had injured his foot during his rookie season, so Nike made the future NBA champion a pair of AirShips that differed in size to accommodate. The right shoe is a size 13, and the left is 13.5.The pair of Air Jordan 7s worn by MJ during the 1992 Summer Olympics on the auction block has a colorful and unique backstory.The pair reportedly comes from a receptionist of the Ambassador Hotel in Barcelona where the Dream Team stayed during the games. Legend has it that it was given as a show of gratitude from the Dream Team for their stay in Barcelona.Michael Jordan from USA during the Final of the 1992 Olympics against Croatia. | Location: Barcelona, Spain.
