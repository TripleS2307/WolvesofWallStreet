The White House has rejected that, and Meadows said Pelosi needs to be clearer about what is in the legislation.Meadows said Republicans\u2019 new offer could pass the Senate if Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) agreed to the proposal.\u201cAs you know, anything in the Senate requires both Democrats and Republicans,\u201d Meadows said. \u201cBut Speaker Pelosi, if she worked with Chuck Schumer, I can tell you all of those things that I just mentioned are available for the American people.\u201dCORRECTION: An earlier version of this article incorrectly characterized Mark Meadows\u2019 position on negotiations."}]}
