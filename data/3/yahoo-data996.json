All three of the major indices logged their worst day since March 16. The Dow (^DJI) saw its fourth worst point loss on record.The selloff on Thursday didn\u2019t appear to be in reaction to specific news, according to Brian Price, head of investments for Commonwealth Financial Network. \u201cThe rally that we\u2019ve seen off of the mid-March lows was a little excessive in my opinion so some natural consolidation is not surprising. We\u2019ve been hearing about retail investors increasingly speculating on riskier stocks and sectors of the market, and that type of enthusiasm can sometimes be a contrarian indicator,\u201d Price said in an email Thursday.\u201cThere are also some questions about an increasing number of coronavirus infections and hospitalizations in certain U.S. states which is, of course, cause for concern. As we\u2019ve crossed over 2 million cases here in the U.S., it seems as though states are continuing to move forward with reopening plans despite concerns about a next wave of the virus,\u201d he added.Customers dine outside at The Inn at Little Washington, one of the countrys most renowned restaurants, on the first day of Virginia's phase one reopening in Washington, Virginia on May 29, 2020.

Economists surveyed by Bloomberg anticipate consumer sentiment rose for the second straight month to 75.0 from 72.3 in May.\u201cSince troughing in April, both the UMich and the Conference Board measure of consumer confidence have only improved slightly,\u201d Credit Suisse said in a note June 4. \u201cState reopenings and gains in the stock market should help lift consumer optimism, but the enormous economic uncertainty, nationwide protests, and the impaired labor market are like to keep confidence low in coming months.\u201d\u2014Heidi Chung is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
