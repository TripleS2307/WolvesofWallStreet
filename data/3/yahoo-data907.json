These are businesses with strong moats albeit with software (see Windows recurring revenue at Microsoft) or hardware (see Apple\u2019s iPhone). In turn, it may be unwise to dump stocks like that simply because of one well-known tech name\u2019s operational missteps.\u201cI don\u2019t know one individual event is really going to be the driver for an unwinding in technology,\u201d said Cowen\u2019s director of market strategy Chris Pollard on Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade. Pollard said these big cap tech high-flyers will continue to be favored by investors for their strong future growth potential in what remains a low growth economic environment.The event that has cast fresh eyes on the explosive tech trade was a doozy, however.A Twitter logo is seen on a computer screen in this photo illustration on October 31, 2017. Material posted on Facebok and other social media directly and indirectly reached over 126 million Americans between 2015 and 2017 according to a company testimony that will be presented to the US Senate judiciary committe on Tuesday.

The hack spread a cryptocurrency scam via posts on the accounts of Apple, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Democratic president hopeful Joe Biden, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, former president Barack Obama, Warren Buffett, Uber and others.\u2018It\u2019s worth it to pay up for\u2019 growthTwitter\u2019s stock fell as much as 5% Thursday on the news, but recovered most of those losses by early afternoon. It\u2019s up 11% on the year, lagging the Nasdaq Composite\u2019s 16% advance. Meanwhile, the iShares U.S. Tech ETF fell nearly 2% but is still up an impressive 18% year-to-date, according to Yahoo Finance Premium data.The social media giant said it\u2019s looking into the matter \u2014 it has not yet shared publicly the source of the hack.Story continues\u201cWe\u2019re overweight tech, preferring software and services,\u201d opined Riverfront Investment Group senior portfolio manager Rebecca Felton on The First Trade when asked if the hack would alter her view on tech stocks. \u201cWhen you think about it, tech is a crowded trade as growth is at a premium. I think it\u2019s worth it to pay up for it [growth] because right now, if you look at tech\u2019s revenue for the second quarter on average the sector\u2019s revenues are expected to be flat to maybe down 1% versus the S&P 500\u2019s where revenues are expected to be down about 10%.\u201dBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
