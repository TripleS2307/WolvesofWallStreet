As extra unemployment benefits from the coronavirus relief bill are set to expire, things look far from back to normal.This far in, one thing is clear: there will be no recovery without crushing the pandemic, which is why some breathed a sigh of relief as the White House endorsed mask-wearing, which experts say slows transmission.Economist Austan Goolsbee, who chaired the Council of Economic Advisors during the Obama administration and is currently a professor at the University of Chicago's Booth School, called this \u201crule one of virus economics.\u201d\u201cThere can be no improvement to the economics unless you get control of the virus,\u201d he told Yahoo Finance. But while President Trump endorsed masks in a tweet, Goolsbee expressed frustration that not enough was being done.\u201cThe president doesn\u2019t want money for testing and doesn\u2019t want to expand the public health component. I think that is a terrible mistake \u2014 it will mean we need trillions more in economic relief if we don\u2019t do those things,\u201d he said.A sign is seen on a barrier at the closed and empty Lincoln Center in Manhattan during the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in New York City, New York, U.S., May 21, 2020. REUTERS/Mike SegarThe difference between the U.S.\u2019s response to the coronavirus and Europe\u2019s is stark \u2013 while the U.S. reached 1,000 deaths from COVID-19 on Tuesday, Europe has largely reopened following lockdowns.\u201cIf we can get on the path that they\u2019ve been on in Europe, in Korea, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and places where they got control of the spread of the disease, you could be looking at smaller [stimulus] numbers,\u201d said Goolsbee. But as the problem snowballs, the amount of stimulus required is much higher, since the economy \u201ccan\u2019t ignite on its own.\u201dGoolsbee said he was concerned that the longer this drags on, the worse it gets. As relief money runs out for businesses, a second wave of unemployment will come \u2014 and then second-order effects emerge like states\u2019 budgets getting slammed, forcing them to lay off workers and even raise taxes.\u201cI think we could be talking about a much more extended downturn than what we\u2019ve been having,\u201d Goolsbee said.Story continuesThere's no federal mask mandate. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)Addressing the virus \u2013 and not the lockdowns \u2013 is how to bring the economy back, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s not a secret \u2014 I have research and other people have research that documents that the main thing that drove the economy into the ground wasn\u2019t lockdown orders coming from governors or mayors or the president. It was people\u2019s fear of catching the disease,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if we get a resurgence of the virus, you are going to see another wave of people stop going out, stop engaging in economic activity, and sadly we\u2019ve kind of seen that starting in the states where it\u2019s flaring up again.\u201dFor now, Goolsbee said that in lieu of a virus under control, Congress needs to extend benefits \u2014 and fast.\u201cMillions of people are going to be thrown out of their houses and there's going to be a dramatic reduction in income for 20, 30 million Americans,\u201d said Goolsbee, \u201cwho are also, by the way, going to be losing their health insurance because they lost their jobs.\u201d--Ethan Wolff-Mann is a writer at Yahoo Finance focusing on consumer issues, personal finance, retail, airlines, and more.
