A Yahoo Finance review of jobless claims data from the U.S. Department of Labor shows that Rhode Island, Montana, and Vermont have seen the strongest early signs of a bottoming out to a return to normal.Comparing each state\u2019s average weekly jobless claims totals over the past six weeks to the six weeks beginning in mid-March, which brought a record amount of unemployment applications, reveals that some states are stopping the bleeding faster than others. Comparing those first six weeks of pain to the latest six-week period shows that Rhode Island, Vermont, Montana, Michigan and Pennsylvania have all seen their average weekly initial jobless claims number fall by 75% or more. While each state is still averaging more unemployment applications compared to weeks before the coronavirus pandemic rattled the employment picture in the U.S., the data shows a trend of unemployment applications relatively slowing.Idaho, Ohio, Utah, West Virginia, and Nevada round out the top 10 states showing the largest drop in average weekly unemployment claims.To be sure, even these states have a long ways to go to return to normal. Michigan, for example, shows the fourth most optimistic trend in slowing job losses, but after weeks of continued unemployment applications it has still racked up the country\u2019s third highest insured unemployment rate in the country at 21.7%. That is to say, while the most recent job destruction might be getting less steep, the mountain it has to climb is still rather large.Story continuesMore worrisome, the data also reveals the trends aren\u2019t slowing in some of the hardest hit states. As we\u2019ve highlighted, Georgia and Florida have led the country in seeing average unemployment claims skyrocket the most over the past few weeks. But those states have also yet to show a sustained improvement in their unemployment picture, with their average weekly unemployment applications only coming down about 20% and 30%, respectively, over the past six weeks compared to the first six weeks since the U.S. coronavirus lockdowns began. That could be a result of Florida locking down its economy later, but it would seem at odds with the fact that Georgia reopened its economy sooner than others.Zack Guzman is the host of YFi PM as well as a senior writer and on-air reporter covering entrepreneurship, cannabis, startups, and breaking news at Yahoo Finance.
