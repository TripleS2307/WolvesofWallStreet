(Photo: Getty Images)Leo Gertner, a lawyer who represents employees in the entertainment industry in New York City, filed for unemployment on March 2 and still hasn\u2019t gotten a check.\u201cTwice I received letters asking for more information \u2014 the first one asked for all my paystubs, and then a second one asked for W2s from my previous job at a policy nonprofit,\u201d Gertner told Yahoo Finance. \u201cI sent them the information both times, via fax and certified mail to Albany.\u201dAfter he didn\u2019t hear back, Gertner sent the office a message using the online portal and was told to call the hotline.\u201cI\u2019ve called at least 100 hundred times and have never gotten through to anyone,\u201d he said. \u201cOn April 17, I emailed and asked for help from my assemblyperson\u2019s office, Inez Dickens, and someone from there reached out and said they placed a complaint on my behalf. That evidently didn\u2019t work. Most recently, I used Twitter to message the DOL and they said I\u2019d receive a callback. That was June 29. I haven\u2019t been called.\u201dGertner filed for unemployment on March 2. (Photo: Leo Gertner)Luckily for Gertner, his wife is still employed, so the couple has been able to pay their bills on time and use her health insurance.\u201cWe paid our daycare for four months without sending our kid there to help them out, but then we stopped paying,\u201d Gertner said. \u201cI've been giving when I can to the food bank and mutual aid organizations, because the situation for people in households that lost more than one job or had only one person working has to be impossible. We no longer have enough to save anything, but we were lucky that before this situation we were saving.\u201dStory continues\u2018It\u2019s all gone now\u2019Gertner isn\u2019t the only American who\u2019s been waiting for months for their unemployment claim to be processed.Jeffrey King, a mechanical engineer from Atlanta, filed for unemployment on March 29.It\u2019s been nearly four months and he still has heard \u201cnot a word,\u201d he told Yahoo Finance. \u201cThe numbers provided either do not work or have rung busy for months.\u201dThe experience has been \u201cterrible\u201d for both he and his wife, although he admitted being \u201clucky enough\u201d to have family members to rely on in the meantime.King filed for unemployment on March 29. (Photo: Jeffrey King)\u201cI graduated from college a year prior to this, and we had just begun to rebuild our savings,\u201d King said. \u201cIt is all gone now. We have had to ask family for money to pay our taxes on income I no longer have.\u201dWhile some are stressing about the weekly UI checks coming to an end, King said he is \u201cno more nervous than I have been receiving nothing.\u201d The unemployment rate in Georgia is around 7.6%, with 373,404 jobless claims filed in June.Fulton County, where King is based out of, has a 10.2% unemployment rate. (Photo: Georgia Department of Labor)According to Kersha Cartwright, the director of communications at Georgia Department of Labor, 91% of unemployment claims have been paid so far.\u201cWe are addressing the claims that are still not paid,\u201d Cartwright told Yahoo Finance in an email statement. \u201cSome of them have identification issues related to multi-agency verification as part of our fraud prevention measures. Each of these must be verified before benefits can be paid. Some of them have separation questions and must go through a benefits eligibility review to determine if benefits should be released. Each of these challenging claims have to have manual intervention to resolve the issue. We are talking with claimants by phone, email, and on our social platforms.\"King, however, is skeptical of the data being published by officials.\u201cGeorgia is actively lying about their responses,\u201d King said. \u201cTons of people have not gotten their benefits \u2026 The unemployment was already not remotely enough, and many people aren\u2019t seeing any of it. It\u2019s a common refrain in the black neighborhood where I live.\u201dPeople wearing face masks stand on a street in Atlanta, Georgia, the United States, July 19, 2020.

Because most state unemployment offices have been inundated with more unemployment claims than their system was designed to handle at once.At least 54 million jobless claims have been filed since the COVID-19 crisis began.In New York, the state\u2019s unemployment rate was at 15.7% for the month of June. In New York City, the rate was even higher at 20.4%.\u201cIt\u2019s frankly very disheartening,\u201d Gertner said. \u201cI\u2019m a lawyer, a labor and employment lawyer no less, so I understand these bureaucracies and I know the rules. I\u2019m used to navigating them and I know my rights. If someone like me keeps hitting dead ends, I can only imagine the difficulty and frustration other people are experiencing. I believe in government and I think it should work for the people.\u201dNew York state\u2019s unemployment office did not respond to request for comment.A long line forms to receive free food from a food pantry run by the Council of Peoples Organization on May 15 in the Midwood neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York.

It would be one thing if there was even a remote sense of NJDOL following up, or being generally prepared.\u201dAmericans worry as unemployment benefits are due to end soon. (Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images)For Justin, he said he\u2019s been affected \u201cin quite a stifling manner.\u201d\u201cMy most critical hope for all of this is that the light is shined on those who are entirely unable to find the ability to maintain an even survivable means of income through this, those without savings large enough, of which I am sure there are many,\u201d he said. \u201cI certainly had to ask for a ton of help, something I truly despise having to do under most circumstances, and that\u2019s just about the only way I managed to get to this point where I am still on the verge of eviction.\u201dCalls for an extensionAs Congress and the White House debate over the next steps for unemployed Americans, these individuals remain in limbo.\u201cMany people are feeling the effects of this pandemic now instead of back in April,\u201d Ali, a network engineer out of Ohio who\u2019s currently unemployed, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cPeople deserve time. If the bills don\u2019t stop and the funding does, something\u2019s gotta give.\u201dAli, who asked his last name not be used for privacy purposes, filed for unemployment in June and hasn\u2019t heard back yet.\u201cI\u2019ve certainly had to utilize much of my savings, but that\u2019s why it\u2019s there,\u201d he added. \u201cThe coming weeks and months will be extremely difficult if I can\u2019t get answers from our state offices.\u201dHouse Democrats urge House Republicans to extend unemployment benefits that was passed as part of the CARES Act which is due to expire on July 31, 2020. (Photo by Michael A. McCoy/Getty Images)For Gertner, he\u2019s worried about the long term as the coronavirus continues to drag on and the economy struggles with a recovery.\u201cNo one is hiring right now, so I'd like to know that the government will provide an extra buffer for the unemployed like me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it also shows how the maximum benefits in our regular unemployment is way too low, $502 a week, and that's only for people who made more than $52,000. If you're making minimum wage and working full-time, I think you only get $300 a week, which is way too little to survive. That's why the $600 mattered \u2014 it was for everyone. Everyone should get at least the maximum of $502 a week. The regular system is stingy, but especially if you make less money.\u201dAdriana is a reporter and editor covering politics and health care policy for Yahoo Finance.
