Everything that is Americana is fireworks and celebration,\u201d Stephen Pelkey, CEO of fireworks display company Atlas PyroVision Entertainment, told Yahoo Finance.\u201cWe celebrate victories, we celebrate our nation\u2019s independence,\u201d said Pelkey.The pandemic could not have hit at a worse time for the fireworks industry, which makes the bulk of its profits in June and July.The fireworks industry has grown over the past decade. In 2019, consumer fireworks revenue hit $1 billion, compared with $636 million in 2010. Display fireworks brought in $375 million in revenue, vs. $316 million in 2010, according to the American Pyrotechnics Association.As coronavirus hit the U.S. in mid-March, major sporting and entertainment events got cancelled, along with their need for celebratory fireworks. Hopes for an economic rebound in July fizzled as many cities and towns across the country cancelled their Fourth of July fireworks. The industry projects a more than 70% loss in annual revenue in 2020.In this Friday, June 19, 2020 photo, fireworks explode during Juneteenth celebrations above the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood in the Brooklyn borough of New York. (AP Photo/John Minchillo, File)Many pyrotechnic companies have been left with large quantities of explosives, which they\u2019ll be forced to store year round.\u201cYou have 150 major pyrotechnic live entertainment companies across the country that are storing in excess of 10 million pounds of low explosives,\u201d said Pelkey, who also serves as secretary of the American Pyrotechnics Association. \u201cWith all mass gatherings cancelled, all of these display companies are forced to comply with strict ATF regulations for securing and insuring all of this inventory.\u201dStory continuesThe fireworks industry is asking Congress for relief to deal with explosive storage costs and lost sales.\u201cMany of these small multigenerational family businesses are just trying to stay alive until the next Fourth of July. And in order to do that, they\u2019re going to need in excess of $2 million in loans that they\u2019re not getting right now,\u201d Pelkey said. \u201cMost of them have been capped at $500,000 or $150,000 and they\u2019re just not going to get there.\u201dAccess to more small business forgivable loans would help support the fireworks industry, explained Pelkey. He hopes that in the next round of fiscal stimulus, lawmakers will make more Economic Injury Disaster Loans available to the fireworks industry.More from Sibile:The case for higher wages during coronavirus recessionMaster P on Aunt Jemima, Uncle Ben\u2019s: \u2018Those are not real people\u2019How JPMorgan Chase is making banking \u2018cool\u2019 for black teenagersKareem Abdul-Jabbar on how Bruce Lee beat the system, fought racismKareem Abdul-Jabbar on George Floyd protests: Black Americans have been playing catch-up economically since the Civil WarFind live stock market quotes and the latest business and finance news"}]}
