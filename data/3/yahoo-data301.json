Retail investors have powered the rally thanks to Robinhood\u2019s innovations pushing the industry to no-fee commissions \u2014 a move that has completely removed the costs of trading, save taxes.Also, tech stocks have driven the market higher \u2014 so high in fact that some mutual funds are incapable of adding enough of the stocks due to concentration issues.Another sign: The Fed\u2019s low interest rates are incentivizing people to put money into the S&P 500 \u2014 because Treasuries are paying so little. And lastly, a handful of stocks with crazy-high valuations are dominating headlines.Add all of that to the feeling that \u201cprices are too high\u201d and it may smell like a bubble. And it could be, of course \u2014 most of the time people don\u2019t really see bubbles until they pop.But in his DataTrek newsletter, Colas points to a few key differences between 2020 and other years, like 2000 and 2007, that make this far more complicated.Some reasons why it\u2019s not bubbleFirst off, bubbles do not usually happen when unemployment is this high \u2014 at 10% now, it's still higher than it was during the last crisis.A trader has his head in his hand on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Thursday, March 12, 2020. (AP Photo/Richard Drew)\"There is no history of this ever happening before,\" Colas wrote. \u201cWhen the S&P 500 peaked in October 2007 during the US housing bubble, unemployment was 4.7%.\u201dThis is important because when unemployment is low, the government is expected to help out far less. That\u2019s why some of the stock market\u2019s juice comes from Washington.Story continues\u201cWhat looks like a bubble is really just investors discounting further government action in an election year,\u201d Colas writes.Bubbles, Colas said, often occur when labor force participation is at generational highs, and we are at a generational low because of the coronavirus fallout. Colas called the labor force participation, which is 61.4%, an \"underappreciated\" factor in how investors see corporate earnings power in the future. The high water mark was in 2000 when participation was 67.3%.So what\u2019s actually going on? The theory that many market observers, including Colas, are taking is that the S&P 500 index and its high reflect the future, especially the future of corporate earnings, as forward 12-month EPS ticked up. It has less to do with the current climate of pandemic-induced economic weakness.That doesn\u2019t mean the house can\u2019t come crashing down, of course. The market, Colas wrote, is \u201cpriced for predictability related to improvement in corporate profits and economic conditions.\u201d\u201cTo our thinking,\u201d he wrote, \u201cit takes more than just frothy Tech/story stocks or Robinhood traders to say US equities are in a bubble that will soon burst.\u201d--Ethan Wolff-Mann is a writer at Yahoo Finance focusing on consumer issues, personal finance, retail, airlines, and more.
