One month later, it\u2019s back up to $235. Shares hit a 52-week high of $250 just last week, even as the boycott continues. The stock is up 14% in 2020 amid the pandemic.Various estimates have pegged the total ad revenue lost so far from the boycott at around $200 million, or barely more than 1% of Facebook\u2019s $17 billion in ad revenue in Q1 2020. The company had $70 billion in ad revenue in 2019.In a town hall meeting at the end of June, Zuckerberg told Facebook employees, according to a transcript reported by The Information, \u201cWe\u2019re not gonna change our policies or approach on anything because of a threat to a small percent of our revenue, or to any percent of our revenue... And my guess is all of these advertisers will be back on the platform soon enough.\u201dThe founder and CEO of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg speaks during the 56th Munich Security Conference (MSC) in Munich, southern Germany, on February 15, 2020.

But analysts largely agree with Zuckerberg: the boycotting brands will be back.\u201cEvery one of these companies\u2014Arcteryx, Patagonia\u2014they\u2019re all coming back,\u201d says Brent Thill of Jefferies. \u201cThey all have to stand out in the short term, but they\u2019re all going to come back. And we think that the press isn\u2019t talking loudly enough about what Facebook has done for small businesses. There are 800 million global small businesses, 160 million use Facebook every day... so it doesn\u2019t matter if Patagonia or Disney leaves. [Millions] of small businesses realize they can find a community on Facebook... So again, we think ultimately this is more noise than any fundamental risk.\u201d (Thill has a Buy rating on the stock and a price target of $285.)Story continuesIndeed, Facebook says more than 160 million small businesses have a Facebook presence; 8 million companies pay to advertise on Facebook. 250 brands, even big public ones, aren\u2019t going to make a dent\u2014yet.Last week, the Wall Street Journal reported that Disney (DIS) has slashed its ad spending on Facebook, but the report did not say by how much or for how long, and Disney did not make any public comment about joining the boycott. It\u2019s more likely that Disney, which was the No. 1 advertiser on Facebook in the first half of the year when it was pushing its new streaming service Disney+, is simply cutting back now that Disney+ is past its launch phase.Disney didn\u2019t comment on the Journal\u2019s report, but Facebook did. It said, \u201cWe invest billions of dollars each year to keep our community safe and continuously work with outside experts to review and update our policies. We know we have more work to do, and we\u2019ll continue to work with civil rights groups, GARM, and other experts to develop even more tools, technology and policies to continue this fight.\u201d It\u2019s the same basic comment Facebook has given since the boycott began, and it will likely keep using the comment until the boycott goes away.\u2014Daniel Roberts is an editor-at-large at Yahoo Finance.
