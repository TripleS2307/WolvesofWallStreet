The 1939 film, adapted from Margaret Mitchell\u2019s novel by the same name, is shrouded in racist depictions \u2014 both blatant and subtle. With the Civil War as the backdrop, \u201cGone With the Wind,\u201d which went on to win 10 Academy Awards, perpetuates harmful stereotypes of people of color.Gone With The Wind, poster, left from left: Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh on 1950s. (Photo by LMPC via Getty Images)This decision came after movie director John Ridley penned an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times Monday requesting the removal of the film. This move is likely to be temporary, but WarnerMedia would bring it back with a \u201cnew introduction from a prominent African American studies scholar,\u201d according to The Washington Post. In an unintended second order effect, the movie hit the top of Amazon\u2019s best-sellers chart on Wednesday.Cops (Paramount Network)The fury around the senseless murders of Black Americans has only been rivaled by the demands to restructure or defund police forces across the country. And depictions of cops \u2014 good or bad \u2014 are being scrutinized across the board. The cop genre is a particularly popular genre, with 61.8% of prime-time dramas that aired on the four major broadcast networks focused on crime and law (21 of the 34), according to a report from civil rights advocacy nonprofit Color of Change.Last week, Paramount Network (VIAC) pulled \u201cCops\u201d from the lineup, and officially canceled the show on Tuesday. Cops, which ran for 25 seasons on Fox, was resurrected on Spike TV (now known as Paramount Network) in 2013.Story continues\u201cCops is not on the Paramount Network and we don\u2019t have any current or future plans for it to return,\u201d a Paramount Network spokesperson said in a statement to Deadline.Live PD (A&E)Similarly, A&E\u2019s popular flagship show Live PD was pulled last week and officially canceled on Wednesday, a day after \u201cCops\u2019\u201d pause became permanent.\u201cThis is a critical time in our nation\u2019s history and we have made the decision to cease production on Live PD. Going forward, we will determine if there is a clear pathway to tell the stories of both the community and the police officers whose role it is to serve them. And with that, we will be meeting with community and civil rights leaders as well as police departments,\u201d an A&E spokesperson told Deadline.Host Dan Abrams expressed his disagreement with the network\u2019s decision to pull the show. \u201cShocked & beyond disappointed about this...To the loyal #LivePDNation please know I, we, did everything we could to fight for you, and for our continuing effort at transparency in policing. I was convinced the show would go on,\u201d he tweeted.Others under scrutinyNow there are even calls to cancel the popular Nickelodeon cartoon series \u201cPaw Patrol,\u201d which portrays public service officials in a positive light. The children\u2019s show focuses on six rescue dogs that operate under the mantra \"no job is too big, no pup is too small.\u201d Parents are taking to social media to defend the well-meaning show.Everyone better leave my son's favorite show alone, can't cancel every show in the world that has cops because of a few bad ones.. Not every cop is racist there are good police too.. Plus it's a kids show.. #IStandWithPawPatrol #PawPatrol pic.twitter.com/GCDQOFb5Ap\u2014 Jacqueline Gonzalez (@jackie01987) June 12, 2020Beyond entertainment content, relics of white supremacy are deeply embedded in the physical foundation of America. There has been a slow unraveling of this structural racism, with more than 114 Confederate symbols removed since the 2015 Charleston massacre of nine African Americans, according to 2019 data from the Southern Poverty Law Center. Since the death of George Floyd on May 25, at least seven cities across the country have removed public Confederate statues and memorials.And top executives are under scrutiny, for institutionalizing or facilitating systemic racism in their organizations. Just this week, the editors-in-chief of Bon App\u00e9tit and Refinery29 and the CEOs of CrossFit and The Wing resigned amid accusations of racial inequity.Melody Hahm is Yahoo Finance\u2019s West Coast correspondent, covering entrepreneurship, technology and culture.
