In the case of Camden, which now boasts one of the most progressive policing policies in the country, Moran says getting officers to buy in to the doctrine would not have been possible without getting rid of its old unionized force. By hiring back half those officers and bringing on new recruits at about a 50% reduction in cost per officer, the town nearly doubled the size of its force with a new focus on acting as \u201cguardians\u201d of the community rather than \u201cwarriors.\u201dStory continuesThe town of Camden, which was once a large industrial town but watched it's population dwindle as manufacturing left, has seen improvement to societal problems including high unemployment, crime, murder and heavy drug trafficking dating back years.

It's about building rapport and trust with the community.\u201dWhile Camden has achieved a marked reduction in violent crime and was able to avoid destructive clashes with protesters, costs have risen since the creation of its new police force. As one internal state report noted, Camden now allocates about a third of its budget towards its county police force, which has since unionized. The internal analysis notes Camden\u2019s $68.45 million in annual police spending \u201ccompels the contraction of other vital city departments and services.\u201dBut Moran says those costs are worth it, and much preferred to the alternative, an expensive police force that fails to protect the community, or worse yet, actively harms its citizens without recourse.\u201cToday, the investment continues to grow,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the return is what I'm looking at, the return is the reduction in crime, the confidence in our police... it\u2019s well worth it, that's what I can tell you at this point. I don't know if this will work for Minneapolis or any other city, but one thing I can tell you is it has worked for Camden, New Jersey.\u201dZack Guzman is the host of YFi PM as well as a senior writer and on-air reporter covering entrepreneurship, cannabis, startups, and breaking news at Yahoo Finance.
