In a traditional roll call vote at a normal convention, state delegations would one-by-one brag about their state and announce how many delegates they\u2019re delivering for the nominee. This year, states will formally nominate Biden with pre-taped segments.The delegates are usually people heavily involved in state politics and they\u2019re awarded to candidates based on the results of primaries and caucuses. When a candidate wins pledged delegates in a state, they are expected to vote for the candidate at the convention.In this image from video, the set in Los Angeles during the first night of the Democratic National Convention on Monday, Aug. 17, 2020. (Democratic National Convention via AP)To secure the nomination, a candidate must win the majority of delegates. This year, President Trump is essentially a shoo-in, but the Democratic candidate will need a total of 1,991 delegates to win. If no one reaches 1,991 votes on the first ballot at the convention, there would be a second ballot.Story continuesClick here for Yahoo Finance's full coverage of the 2020 electionCampaigns and supporters would wheel and deal on the convention floor, trying to convince delegates to support their candidate.\u201cThat would be real drama. That would be drama in real time,\u201d said Kamarck.But we haven\u2019t seen that kind of drama recently. There hasn\u2019t been a real nomination fight on the convention floor in decades. By the time the conventions roll around, we usually already know the nominees. Biden hit the magic delegate number back in June, but the vote at the convention makes his nomination official.\u2018As good a TV show as they can have\u2019\u201cThey usually make a big show about it and which state puts the candidate over the top,\u201d said Kamarck. \u201cSo usually what will happen is by Monday night, Tuesday night, all the business of the convention is done, and they proceed to have as good a TV show as they can have.\u201dPart of that \u201cTV show\u201d typically includes acceptance speeches by the nominees in front of massive crowds \u2014but the pandemic wrecked both parties\u2019 plans. Biden will accept the nomination from Delaware, instead of Milwaukee as originally planned. President Trump was originally planning to give his acceptance speech from Jacksonville, Fla., before canceling the gathering. He may now give his acceptance speech at the White House.Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden and his running mate Sen.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)The mostly virtual 2020 conventions will be like nothing ever seen before and experts say 2024 could be something entirely new too.\u201cFor a number of years, people have said that these conventions needed change. They needed to be rethought or reimagined to meet kind of the needs of a grassroots activist base \u2014 which really it hadn\u2019t been able to do in prior years,\u201d said Brown of George Washington University. \u201cThe coronavirus pandemic is forcing the parties to rethink what had become something of a staid tradition, and I think we will see in future years, a different looking national party convention.\u201dJessica Smith is a reporter for Yahoo Finance based in Washington, D.C.
