He\u2019s more comfortable in both worlds than most politicians all the way back to starting his first business (a driveway sealing service) when he was just 14 years old.Now he\u2019s a top surrogate for Joe Biden and sat down virtually with Rick Newman for Yahoo Finance\u2019s convention coverage as Democrats kick off their event this week.Terry McAuliffe (D-VA) was a close advisor to the Clintons and served at the Governor of Virginia.

He developed a close relationship with Biden ever since he was serving as Virginia\u2019s governor and Biden was Vice President across the Potomac river.He says he has spoken with Biden many times in recent months and they\u2019ve tended to center around one topic: \u201cinfrastructure, infrastructure infrastructure, we've got to rebuild America.\u201dFormer Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden appeared together in Virginia in 2019. (REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein)In recent years, \u201cInfrastructure week\u201d has been a running joke as the hope for a focus on serious issues like crumbling roads has inevitably been overwhelmed by a short-lived controversy that often emanates from President Trump\u2019s Twitter account.Biden has proposed a $2 billion infrastructure plan focused on green energy and jobs to \u201cbuild a modern, sustainable infrastructure now and deliver an equitable clean energy future.\u201d Trump has intermittently focused on the issue, including a short-lived deal with Democrats last year to spend $2 billion. It quickly fell apart.But infrastructure has remained a more durable issue among state governments and in the business community. At the biggest meeting of the nation\u2019s governors in February, infrastructure was much more likely to be discussed among governors than Trump\u2019s unfolding impeachment trial.Story continuesA recent report estimated that America\u2019s crumbling infrastructure could be responsible for a loss of almost $4 trillion in GDP and 2.5 million jobs by 2025 unless new investments are made.\u2018People are going to have to pay more taxes\u2019McAuliffe wasn\u2019t shy about what Biden\u2019s plans would mean: higher taxes. \u201cYeah, people are going to have to pay more taxes,\u201d he said, but added they \u201care fine with that as long as the government is very wise about spending and taking and protecting taxpayer dollars.\u201dA recent analysis of Biden\u2019s tax plans found that he would be \u201cincreasing taxes for the top 1% of earners by 13% to 18% of after-tax income, while indirectly increasing taxes for most other groups by 0.2% to 0.6%.\u201dBiden would also raise the corporate tax rate to to 28%, toward the level it was during the Obama administration from the current rate of 21%.Gov.

McAuliffe says everyone should support measures to pay it down for economic stability.\u201cI\u2019m not going to pay it, but my five kids certainly are,\u201d he says.Biden can \u2018rebuild the American economy\u2019The currently pandemic, even as tragic as it\u2019s been, \u201cis an opportunity for Joe Biden to come in and rebuild the American economy,\u201d says McAuliffe.He says that the convention will show Americans and business leaders alike that Democrats have a real plan of how to build the post-COVID economy. \u201cI think people are yearning for leadership,\u201d he says.The former governor, who\u2019s also run two national conventions during his career, pushed back on the idea that the virtual nature of the convention will blunt its impact. \u201cI think you're going to get a lot more eyeballs\u201d on the key speeches later in the week, McAuliffe says, as people look for answers from Biden and Kamala Harris.Ben Werschkul is a producer for Yahoo Finance in Washington, DC.Graphic by Yahoo FinanceRead more:Michigan\u2019s governor on whether Biden has her state sewn up: \u2018I don't buy it for a second\u2019Joe Biden\u2019s road to the Democratic presidential nominationSummers says stocks 'do better' during Democratic administrationsRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit."}]}
