It packs a huge display, stylish design, impressive battery life, and the line\u2019s most crucial ingredient: the S Pen stylus.At $1,299, though, the Note20 Ultra also carries a beast of a price tag. But that price gets you a host of features that Android fans looking for a top-flight device will certainly appreciate, including 5G connectivity.Samsung's Galaxy Note20 Ultra is a huge smartphone that packs the company's signature S Pen stylus. (Image: Howley)Samsung, however, also offers a slightly smaller and less expensive version of the Note20 for $999, as well as its $999 S20+ 5G, and $1,399 S20 Ultra, giving consumers a dizzying array of options to choose from.A fresh take on a giant smartphoneSamsung\u2019s Galaxy Note line brought big-screen smartphones into the mainstream. When the original Note launched in 2011, it packed a 5.3-inch display that drew stares for its then-massive size. Fast forward 9 years, and no one bats an eye at the nearly 7-inch display on the Note20 Ultra.For 2020, Samsung has cleaned up the camera cover on the Note20 Ultra\u2019s back panel, the three lenses are now more exaggerated, giving them a far more appealing look than the thin strip of lenses found on the Note10.This time around, Samsung has given the Note20 Ultra a fresh bronze paint job as its go-to color, making the handset look and feel just a bit more luxurious than its predecessor.The Note20 Ultra\u2019s enormous display is fantastic for watching movies and flipping through Instagram or TikTok. The 6.9-inch panel uses Samsung\u2019s AMOLED 2X Infinity-O Display technology, which basically means it produces vibrant colors and packs a 120hz refresh rate. That\u2019s more or less the same kind of display you\u2019ll find on the Galaxy S20 line.The Note20 Ultra packs an enormous 6.9-inch display. (Image: Howley)That refresh rate, which measures the number of times the screen shows a new image each second, means scrolling through websites and even writing on the display with the S Pen stylus looks and feels smoother.But make no mistake, the Note20 Ultra is not for people who want a more compact smartphone. Measuring 6.5 inches tall, the Note20 Ultra is bigger than even Apple\u2019s (AAPL) iPhone 11 Pro Max, which tops out at 6.2 inches. Though that phone also has a smaller 6.5-inch display.Story continuesIf you\u2019re used to rocking a larger phone, though, it shouldn\u2019t take much getting used to.S Pen and air writingSamsung always tries to add new, interesting features to its S Pen stylus to make it more than just a, well, stylus. For the Note20 line, that means a handful of what Samsung calls Air Actions have been thrown into the mix.Air Actions are gestures you can make with the S Pen while holding down the pen\u2019s action button that let you do things like control the volume in Spotify by gesturing up or down, or pulling up your recent apps by gesturing back.It\u2019s a nifty party trick, but I can\u2019t see many people actually using it in any real-world scenario.The Note20 Ultra's biggest attractive, beyond its size, is its S Pen stylus. (Image: Howley)Still, the S Pen is a champion when it comes to taking on-screen notes and marking up documents, which is exactly what it\u2019s meant to do. And, as usual, the tip of the stylus offers an excellent amount of resistance, making writing feel far more natural.Quality camerasWhen Samsung released its Galaxy S20 Ultra earlier this year, it added an over-the-top 100x zoom function that looked more impressive on paper than its actual results did. So Samsung scaled that back the Note20 Ultra, giving the phone a 50x zoom instead.Still, I found the extreme zoom to be minimally useful for taking clear photos. Sure, you get a sense of the scene, but you\u2019ll still see blurring just as I did with the 100x zoom on the S20 Ultra.The Note20 captures sharp, clear photos with a slightly blue tint. (Image: Howley)When taking shots with the Note20 Ultra\u2019s wide-angle camera, though, images came out crisp and clear. Even low-light shots looked surprisingly good. When compared with shots taken using the iPhone 11 Pro Max, I found the Note20 Ultra\u2019s images tended to look a bit less vibrant, with colors appearing flatter on the Ultra.The Note20 Ultra\u2019s selfie camera, meanwhile, proved softer than the iPhone 11 Pro Max\u2019s, but produced brighter live video images.The Note20 captures vibrant low-light shots. (Image: Howley)Speaking of video, Samsung has also added the ability to control where the Note20 Ultra picks up sound in your movies. You can force the phone to focus on audio from in front of it, around it, or zoom in on an audio source. That should prove helpful when you\u2019re trying to capture a more cinematic experience in your home movies.Performance and powerThe Galaxy Note20 Ultra is meant to be a monster of a smartphone, and it certainly has the performance chops to fit that role. It packs a Qualcomm (QCOM) Snapdragon 865+ processor, and 12GB of RAM with your choice of 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB of storage space. There\u2019s also a microSD card slot that supports cards of up to 1TB in size.The Note20 Ultra packs three cameras and tons of processing power. (Image: Howley)In terms of battery life, the Note20 Ultra was able to handle streaming live video over Google Meets during Yahoo Finance\u2019s live daily broadcasts for an hour without running down nearly as quickly as the iPhone 11 Pro Max.Both phones end up getting me through an entire day even when I\u2019m broadcasting, but the Note20 Ultra had more juice by the time I was ready to hit the sack.Should you get it?The Note20 Ultra is a powerhouse of a smartphone thanks to its enormous screen, powerful processor, and exceptional battery life. It\u2019s camera could use some work, and fewer gimmicks, but it\u2019s still one of the better choices on the market.If you\u2019re not a fan of the S Pen stylus, I\u2019d recommend opting for Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S20 line of handsets. They offer many of the same features without the added pen. If you\u2019re looking for a stylus, but the Ultra is too pricey, there\u2019s also the standard Note20, which starts at $999.You won\u2019t get the same kind of camera and will have to work with a 6.7-inch panel rather than the Ultra\u2019s 6.9-inch display, but that\u2019s not likely to be a problem for most users.If you want the biggest baddest Note, though, opt for the Ultra.Got a tip?
