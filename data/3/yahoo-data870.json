Dr. Michael Saag, associate dean for global health at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, joined Yahoo Finance to discuss schools\u2019 problems across the country.\u201cI believe that we\u2019re having a silent epidemic emerging right now within the K through 12 schools,\u201d said Saag. He tells Yahoo Finance that K-12 students pose more risk of spreading COVID-19 because, unlike their college student counterparts, younger students are not being tested and quarantined at the same rate.\u201cOn college campuses, we saw hot spots emerge, but we knew it because we were testing. At the University of Alabama at Auburn, in my neck of the woods, they had big spikes towards the end of August which they\u2019re getting under control because they know who\u2019s infected. They can quarantine, and the students have paid attention now, but in K through 12, we\u2019re not doing that.\u201dKid going to school during the coronavirus pandemic.Saag expects that coronavirus infections will rise over the next four weeks. He said the statistic to watch for is the percent positive, which he fears will give rise to an \u201cOctober surprise.\u201d\u201cOur October surprise that what we\u2019re going to have is an explosive number of adults showing up [positive] because they picked it up from the kids who have been back in school. And I\u2019m very worried about that right now,\u201d he said.\u201cWe can\u2019t relax, this virus is here, it\u2019s like a ghost, it\u2019s kind of hanging out. It\u2019s in the area. We can\u2019t see it until we start seeing the cases come up.\u201dSaag says wearing a mask is a \u201cpatriotic duty,\u201d and questioned why President Trump had not been an advocate for mask-wearing.\u201cI don\u2019t want to go into politics, but I will raise the question. I personally do not understand why the president is not just doubling down, but tripling down on the mask-wearing. It doesn\u2019t add up,\u201d he said\u201cIt splits the country, and it makes all of our jobs harder to do what we need to do. If we could just all pull together, wear a mask; it\u2019s sort of a patriotic duty to protect ourselves, our families, our community. Let\u2019s just do that. And maybe we\u2019ll get this under some degree of control.\u201dStory continuesReggie Wade is a writer for Yahoo Finance.
