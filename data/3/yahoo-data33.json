Washington, D.C., where the White House is located, requires workers and customers to wear masks at every business, while businesses must have a workplace safety plan and allow employees to distance safely.The Trump White House has flagrantly flouted such guidelines, for all the world to see. At the Sept. 26 reception for Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett in the outdoor Rose Garden, attendees sat elbow-to-elbow, most of them maskless. That event moved indoors, where there was more maskless mingling. And there has never been a formal masking policy in the White House\u2019s work areas, where President Trump himself is the most prominent mask shunner.In this Sept. 26, 2020, photo President Donald Trump, center, stands with Judge Amy Coney Barrett as they arrive for a news conference to announce Barrett as his nominee to the Supreme Court, in the Rose Garden at the White House in Washington.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)With Trump and at least 30 staffers and associates now testing positive for COVID-19, White House protocols\u2014or lack of them\u2014may meet the standard for recklessness that would make a normal business liable for harm caused to workers or customers. \u201cThe White House behaved in a textbook way to open yourself to tort liability,\u201d says professor Heidi Li Feldman of Georgetown University Law Center. \u201cIt\u2019s instructive for other American businesses. It\u2019s a good lesson in how not to run your business.\u201dIt\u2019s difficult to sue the government, because of the principle of sovereign immunity. But the law does allow suits when the government does something similar to what a private person or organization would do, and there\u2019s harm that would generate liability in the private sector. The Barrett ceremony on Sept. 26 might have been such an event, similar to a promotional event or press conference a corporation might hold.White House employees are \u2018on their own\u2019Employees hurt or sickened on the job typically file for workers\u2019 compensation, and it can be difficult to sue for additional damages beyond that. CDC guidelines are voluntary. The White House and other federal agencies must follow rules set by the Occupational Health and Safety Administration\u2014not state or local regulation. But Trump\u2019s OSHA hasn\u2019t established any rules for what government agencies must do to protect workers from COVID, despite calls for it to do so.Story continues\u201cThose White House employees are on their own,\u201d says Debbie Berkowitz, who was a senior OSHA official during the Obama administration and is now a safety expert at the National Employment Law Project. \u201cThey probably can\u2019t sue if they get sick or die. This is probably the cleanest example of how this president thinks our essential workers should be treated.\u201dA workers\u2019 compensation claim could still provide some relief to sickened White House employees. \u201cIf I got COVID because I worked at the White House, I\u2019d be talking to a lawyer,\u201d Feldman says. \u201cThe statistically unusual number of people who got sick looks like you might have a workers comp claim. I would definitely be thinking of filing a claim and if it didn\u2019t cover all expenses, I would look at whether I had any residual rights to bring suit.\u201dA member of the cleaning staff sprays The James Brady Briefing Room of the White House, Monday, Oct. 5, 2020, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)Customers at a business, or other third parties, such as students at a university, have better odds of suing if they can show the business was responsible for harming or making them sick. And there were third parties at the Sept. 26 Barrett event who later contracted COVID, such as two Republican senators, the president of the University of Notre Dame, and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. But there\u2019s footage of all of them without masks, and it\u2019s hard to sue an organization for reckless endangerment if your own personal behavior was also reckless, and you were a voluntary attendee. At least three White House reporters also contracted COVID-19 since the Barrett event.Fourteen states have established new standards to protect workers from COVID, though even in those states, it remains difficult for workers to prove they got infected on the job, rather than elsewhere in the community. Congressional Republicans want to pass legislation giving businesses blanket immunity if workers or customers contract COVID. Democrats insist any liability shield be paired with tough federal standards all businesses in the country must meet to protect workers. This is one of many standoffs preventing Congress from passing a fourth stimulus bill.So far, there doesn\u2019t seem to be an explosion of COVID litigation by workers or consumers against businesses. (Less than a third of Americans say they would sue a business if they were exposed to COVID-19 while visiting the establishment, according to a Yahoo Finance-Harris poll taken in July.) A COVID complaint database run by law firm Hunton Andrews Kurth includes 93 legal complaints for risky work conditions, such as lack of protective gear, and only 5 for death or injury not in a health care facility. A group of workers is suing Amazon for unsafe work conditions that allegedly caused the COVID death of an employee\u2019s family member. Nursing homes are beginning to face lawsuits relating to thousands of COVID deaths.There are over 7.4 million cases in the U.S. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)Businesses that comply with state and local safety regulations typically have strong protection against lawsuits. If there are no state or local rules, complying with CDC guidelines helps\u2014and disregarding them hurts. \u201cNursing home liability boils down to things they did that were clearly not what the CDC advises,\u201d says lawyer Eric Robbie of Boston law firm CMBG3. \u201cThat\u2019s enough for a plaintiff to bring a lawsuit.\u201dIf the White House were a business\u2014even an essential one\u2014violating CDC guidance would be a similar risk. \u201cPeople outdoors, no masks, some instances of not social distancing\u2014those things would weigh in the favor of a potential plaintiff,\u201d Robbie says. \u201cThey\u2019re not proof of negligence, but evidence of negligence.\u201d A jury might be the ultimate arbiter\u2014if it weren\u2019t the White House.Rick Newman is the author of four books, including \u201cRebounders: How Winners Pivot from Setback to Success.\u201d Follow him on Twitter: @rickjnewman.
