He noted Spotify (SPOT) and Slack (WORK) both went public via direct listings.[Read more: Don\u2019t say \u2018IPO\u2019: What to know about Slack\u2019s direct listing]NYSE recently submitted a detailed amended change to the Securities and Exchange Commission that would allow companies undergoing a direct listing to raise new capital by selling shares on their own behalf. Currently, direct listings only allow the sale of existing shares, not the issuance of new ones.During a direct listing, a designated market maker, or DMM, determines the opening price based on buy and sell orders. Companies hire advisers to help with the process, but there is no costly intermediary underwriter, or roadshow as in traditional IPOs.\u201cIf this is a way of lowering the cost, it will encourage more companies to go public,\u201d said University of Florida Cordell Eminent Scholar Jay Ritter.One of the criticisms from venture capitalists has been the underpricing of shares by underwriters in traditional IPOs. Take some of June\u2019s examples: Warner Music Group (WMG), ZoomInfo (ZI), Shift4 Payments (FOUR), Vroom (VRM). Those four stocks closed considerably higher than their IPO price on the first day of trading, leaving \u201c$1.5 billion on the table,\u201d says Ritter.\u201cThose are profits for the first day investors, but on the other hand that\u2019s money that the company didn\u2019t raise even though the market was willing to pay a much higher price for the stock than the underwriters set for the offer price,\u201d Ritter recently told Yahoo Finance.\u201cThe traditional underwriters definitely don\u2019t want this to become popular,\u201c he added.Story continuesIMAGE DISTRIBUTED FOR THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE - Shift4 Payments, Inc.

It was the early private shareholders\u2019A direct listing, even with a capital raise attached, may not be the best option, says Lise Buyer of Class V Group, a Silicon Valley consultant for companies going public.\u201cI think 2 out of 2 haven\u2019t worked out very well for the public shareholders,\u201d said Buyer.Spotify and Slack both opened successfully, but in the case of Spotify the stock closed lower than at the open on the first day and declined the next. In Slack\u2019s case, the stock opened at $38.50 last year and declined in the weeks that followed.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to see who won from the direct listing. It was the early private shareholders.\u201d she said. \u201cWho lost in Slack\u2019s listing? The new investors ... had they waited a couple of days, they could\u2019ve bought it later in the open market.\u201d\u201cIf a company wants to avoid that first day pop, wants to price to where demand really is, then an auction model solves that problem where you get perfect pricing information up front,\u201c she added.

The commission extended the time to decide on the proposed rule change by 60 days, while it reviews public comments based on NYSE\u2019s amendment. The SEC would not comment on this story.\u201cWhat they\u2019re concerned about, with a direct listing that simultaneously has a capital raising event [is] that this is a way of getting around existing regulations,\u201d said Ritter.Buyer highlights liability \u201cwould be an issue\u201d in a direct listing combined with a primary share offering. In traditional IPOs, the underwriters are liable for inaccuracies or omissions in filings.The drum has been beating louder to make direct listings more appealing as more companies express interest in them. In February, workplace toolmaker Asana said it had filed to go public via direct listing. And last year Airbnb reportedly indicated it was leaning towards entering the public market this way. Then the coronavirus pandemic hit.Asked wether he believes the SEC will lean towards such a change Ritter said, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a slam dunk, but I think it\u2019s pretty likely.\u201dInes covers the U.S. stock market from the floor of the New York Exchange.
