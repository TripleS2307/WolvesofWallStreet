Chinese media had reported over the weekend that ByteDance would aim not to fully sell TikTok's US. operations to Microsoft or Oracle, in an attempt to retain partial control. The subtext of the partnership is that Oracle won\u2019t get control of TikTok\u2019s user algorithm, which was seen as the crown jewel of any deal.(In its statement to Yahoo Finance on the news on Monday, TikTok said: \u201cWe can confirm that we\u2019ve submitted a proposal to the Treasury Department which we believe would resolve the Administration\u2019s security concerns. This proposal would enable us to continue supporting our community of 100 million people in the US who love TikTok for connection and entertainment, as well as the hundreds of thousands of small business owners and creators who rely upon TikTok to grow their livelihoods and build meaningful careers.\u201d)The proposal will still need approval from the White House.Walmart (WMT), meanwhile, which had reportedly joined the bidding war, would still like to invest in TikTok with Oracle as the lead, Reuters reports.None of the three names that were in the mix over the past few weeks\u2014Microsoft, Oracle, or Walmart\u2014was an obvious fit to buy TikTok.Microsoft does not own any consumer-facing social media apps apart from LinkedIn, which is more of a professional platform and is a far cry from video-sharing apps like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, and YouTube; Oracle is not in the content or social media business in any form; Walmart is a giant retailer that has not tried social tech apart from its video-streaming platform Vudu. At least in Walmart\u2019s case, analysts could see how owning TikTok might allow Walmart to use TikTok affiliate links and sponsored influencer posts to boost its e-commerce presence.Story continuesAnd now that Oracle is confirming that it has won, analysts still aren\u2019t seeing the logic.Oracle co-founder and Chairman Larry Ellison delivers a keynote address during the Oracle OpenWorld on October 22, 2018 in San Francisco, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\u201cWe can\u2019t find a sound rationale for Oracle to focus on TikTok,\u201d wrote Citi analyst Walter Pritchard in a note on Monday. He added the TikTok partnership \u201cisn\u2019t likely to change the competitiveness of Oracle in cloud, and might even weigh on the business due to the \u201cfinancial resources\u201d the partnership will require.A note from Bank of America on Monday predicted that the deal \u201cmay cause an overhang on the stock in the near-term given Oracle's limited experience in consumer media.\u201d\u201cIt's a head-scratcher in terms of the strategic merits for Oracle,\u201d Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance by phone on Monday. The idea of a partnership rather than full sale, Ives said, \u201cmakes it a single, whereas a home run would have been an acquisition. But it's a feather in the cap for [Oracle founder] Larry Ellison in terms of being a partner of the government, coming off the heels of Microsoft winning the JEDI contract. For Oracle, it's actually less about the TikTok partnership and more about the broader ramifications, for a company fighting AWS tooth and nail.\u201dIndeed, the political symbolism of Oracle getting the partnership could be a branding win for Oracle among cloud competitors. And Ellison\u2019s friendship with President Trump is one potential explanation for Oracle\u2019s interest.The Silicon Valley billionaire held a fundraiser for Trump\u2019s reelection campaign in February, and when news of Oracle\u2019s bid for TikTok came out last month, Trump commented at an event in Arizona, \u201cOracle is a great company. I think its owner is a tremendous guy. He\u2019s a tremendous person. I think that Oracle would be certainly somebody that could handle it.\u201d Oracle CEO Safra Catz is also a Trump supporter.Ives also believes Oracle\u2019s involvement as a \u201cBig Brother, making sure there\u2019s no back door to Beijing\u201d could satisfy the White House\u2019s security concerns.On the other hand, former White House CIO Theresa Payton (who was the first woman to hold that role, in 2006) does not believe a partnership with Oracle would really satisfy Trump\u2019s stated security concerns about the app. \u201cUnless Oracle has access to TikTok\u2019s source code, including their A.I. algorithm, and a direct role in controlling American users\u2019 data privacy, this deal does not quell any national security concerns put forth by the Trump administration,\u201d Payton, now CEO of Fortalice Solutions, tells Yahoo Finance. \u201cOracle acting as a hall monitor for data simply isn\u2019t good enough.\u201d\u2014Daniel Roberts is an editor-at-large at Yahoo Finance and closely covers tech.
