The company, which digitizes physical photos, says it has digitized and sent 600 million pictures back to customers.But in recent weeks, Goldstone has seen an array of problems as new Postmaster General Louis DeJoy has begun to implement operational changes that are slowing deliveries. \u201cWe see it here everyday and we get it in the customer service phone calls,\u201d Goldstone said.The reports are similar across the country. Small businesses that rely heavily on shipping products are reporting problems after years of reliable service, including some in DeJoy\u2019s home state of North Carolina.A United States Postal Service mail carrier poses in front of her truck before departing on her delivery route in El Paso, Texas.

During remarks to the Board of Governors last week, DeJoy promised to \u201caggressively monitor and quickly address service issues.\u201dMuch of the focus on the Post Office\u2019s current problems have centered around this fall\u2019s election with record levels of voting expected by mail. But business owners like Goldstone want to draw attention to the business sector. In an open letter to the Post Office, he said millions of small businesses could be impacted because of the \u201cdevastating\u201d delays.According to a 2019 USPS report, 70% of the smallest businesses \u2013 those with fewer than 10 employees \u2013 use the Post Office regularly and spend an average $359 a month on shipping.Bipartisan calls for actionThe USPS operates as a self-supporting federal agency \u2013 part independent business and part government agency. It likes to tout that it gets no tax dollars in normal times.But two factors \u2013 a drop in demand during the pandemic and a mandate in the Postal Act of 2006, which advocates say puts \u201cthe Postal Service in a straight jacket\u201d financially \u2013 mean it\u2019s on the verge of running out of money as early as this year.Story continuesA USPS letter carrier crosses Boston Street with greatly reduced traffic during the coronavirus outbreak in March.

DeJoy says that Congress should help, but that he needs to cut services in the meantime.Sen. Gary Peters (D-MI) started an investigation into the delays, and Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), in a statement over the weekend, called for Congress to get back to the negotiating table for a stimulus deal to help groups, including \u201cthe USPS with this persistent pandemic.\u201dDeJoy recently met with stimulus negotiators. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer afterwards described it as a \u201cheated discussion.\u201d\u2018I am very confident that we can turn our business around\u2019Much of the answer, according to President Trump and other Republicans, is for the USPS to massively raise rates. In April, the president called the service \u201ca joke\u201d because of the rates it charges companies like Amazon. Fact checkers have disputed the claim that package rates are the reason for the current financial troubles.Either way, a hike in rates would likely hurt small businesses even more. The current rates are considerably lower for the smallest sized parcels when compared to the rates at UPS (UPS) or FedEx (FDX).ScanMyPhotos digitizes thousand of photos daily (Photo from ScanMyPhotos)\u201cI am very confident that we can turn our business around,\u201d Dejoy said recently. The USPS recently launched a loyalty program offering new credits to help retain smaller businesses.Goldstone remains hopeful that Washington can figure out a solution to the problem and things will eventually return to normal after the partisan fever around vote-by-mail subsides. In the meantime, he says it\u2019s difficult to maintain his businesses especially given the fact that many of his current customers are using the service to honor family members who have died in the pandemic.\u201cThe last thing people need to wonder is where the heck are their loved ones\u2019 \u2013 [who] just passed away \u2013 lifetime of photos,\u201d he said.Ben Werschkul is a producer for Yahoo Finance in Washington, DC.Read more:USPS in 'dire' financial position, says Postmaster GeneralShowdowns over the Postal Service loom as a union chief says Trump is \u2018scapegoating\u2019 membersThis Senator wants to bring back banking at the Post OfficeRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit."}]}
