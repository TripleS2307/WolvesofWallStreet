Johnson is fresh off meeting with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg to discuss ways to better police content.The NAACP has been at the leading edge of taking Facebook to task for its subpar internal controls around hate speech. It\u2019s efforts have led to numerous big-name Facebook advertisers such as Unilever and Coca-Cola to halt spending on the platform. The results of the company\u2019s two-year audit on how it polices its site and its culture was released Wednesday and revealed Facebook lacking in many areas. Indeed, advertisers will unlikely be pleased.\u201cI raised the question yesterday. They have a huge blind spot when it comes to hate groups and the sentiments of Americans across the country. If you look at the peaceful protests across the country, it looks like America. You have young, old, male, female, Black and white. That\u2019s the reality that Americans want to see on platforms such as Facebook. It\u2019s operating like a public utility. There are no accountability measures in place. One person makes the decision and you have a culture within the company that has huge blind spots when it comes to race issues and antisemitic behavior.,\u201d Johnson added.FILE - In this Thursday, Dec. 12, 2019, file photo, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People President Derrick Johnson faces reporters during a news conference in Boston. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg met with civil rights leaders, Tuesday, July 7, 2020, including the organizers of a widespread advertising boycott of the social network over hate speech on its platform. Johnson, who was present on the Zoom meeting, said Facebook\u2019s executives only delivered cheap talk, filled with little commitment to new rules or actions that would curb racism and misinformation. (AP Photo/Steven Senne, File)Johnson tells Yahoo Finance he got \u201cnothing\u201d from his meeting with Zuckerberg and Sandberg. Facebook didn\u2019t respond to Yahoo Finance\u2019s request for comment.At this point in Facebook\u2019s lifespan, one has to wonder if they have lost control of what\u2019s on their site. And that strong policing is unlikely to happen at all.\u201cIt has to be a combination of human and it has to be a combination of machine. I think a lot of times machines cannot solve all the problems because machines need training. Machines are as good as much as you train the machines,\u201d said former Snap chief strategy officer and now Verishop CEO Imran Khan on The First Trade, on whether Facebook has lost control of the platform. \u201cI think at some point you have to get a human involved, and then I think a lot of those things also require human judgment.\u201dStory continuesDespite the public uproar, Facebook\u2019s stock has stayed surprisingly resilient. Shares are up 18% year-to-date, slightly outperforming the Nasdaq Composite.Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
