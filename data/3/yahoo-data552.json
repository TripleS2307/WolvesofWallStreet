Last month, pharmaceutical companies Moderna (MRNA) and Pfizer (PFE) announced that each had begun phase three trials on a respective vaccine candidate.Moderna will likely complete phase three trials by Thanksgiving, the company\u2019s CEO Stephane Bancel said.Earlier this month, President Donald Trump said he was \u201coptimistic\u201d that a vaccine will be ready around Election Day, Nov. 3, while Barouch said the best possible timeline would deliver a vaccine by the end of 2020.\u201cThe most optimistic scenario is that one or more vaccines will be available for emergency use authorization by the end of this calendar year or beginning of 2021,\u201d he says. \u201cThen vaccines becoming more available for the general public sort of throughout the 2021 calendar year.\u201d\u201cOf course, we also know that not everything goes absolutely perfectly the first time in science and medicine. In which case, then, of course, the timelines will have to be revised,\u201d he adds.Story continuesBarouch spoke to Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer in an episode of \u201cInfluencers with Andy Serwer,\u201d a weekly interview series with leaders in business, politics, and entertainment.Dr. Dan Barouch is pictured at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center's Center for Virology and Vaccine Research in Boston, MA on March 5, 2020.

The vaccine is currently undergoing phase one and two trials but aims to begin phase three trials next month, Barouch saidAmid widespread eagerness for a vaccine, Barouch stressed the importance of tests that ensure the vaccine works and doesn\u2019t do harm.\u201cIt's very difficult to predict the future. We, of course, would hope to have a vaccine as soon as possible, but at least in my opinion, only when it's been proven to be safe and effective, because I think that's absolutely critically important for any vaccine, even during a pandemic period,\u201d he says.Vaccine development has served as a bright spot alongside the difficulties faced in fighting the coronavirus, he added.\u201cThere have been a lot of challenges and issues with COVID-19 that have really not gone very well,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I would say that vaccine research overall for the field has gone very well so far, in terms of the field developing not one but multiple different vaccine candidates.\u201dRead more:Economy may undergo \u2018sawtooth\u2019 recovery from coronavirus: Former Fed Vice ChairBill Gates: We should be able to \u2018manufacture a lot of vaccines\u2019 next yearJump into stock market expecting rise 'a fool's errand': Billionaire investor David RubensteinMichael Dell: \u2018Not enough\u2019 progress on diversity in the tech industryRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"}]}
