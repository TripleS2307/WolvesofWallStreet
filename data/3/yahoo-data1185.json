The Nasdaq underperformed again, with some major tech names that had recently led the market higher giving back some gains.[Click here to read what\u2019s moving markets heading into Wednesday, August 12] Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday that Russia became the first country globally to give regulatory approval to a Covid-19 vaccine, with the move coming less than two months after human testing of the inoculation began. The vaccine still must complete final trials, though mass production is expected by the end of the year.\u201cEvery time you get some good news on Covid, and now we\u2019ve got a potential vaccine coming from Russia \u2013 it\u2019s skeptical at best, but nevertheless, the market is embracing it at this point,\u201d David Nelson, Belpointe chief strategist, told Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cThe First Trade\u201d on Tuesday.\u201cEvery time we get news on that, or something bright economically, we start to move out of these large cap secular growth names and move down that valuation trade to more cyclical shares,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it makes sense, because some names in the Nasdaq \u2013 in particular, cloud and some other areas like stay-at-home stocks, are pretty egregiously expensive. Some of these names are a 1000x earnings, 50x cash flow.\u201dShares of travel companies including Wynn Resorts (WYNN), Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH), Carnival Corp. (CCL) and a host of airlines jumped amid the vaccine news, and after InterContinental Hotels (IHG) suggested an improvement in travel demand in first-half results released before the bell on Tuesday. The commentary added to other recent upbeat assessments of consumer sentiment around travel, with Marriott (MAR) on Monday also suggesting travel trends were improving from an April low. Chinese electric car-maker Nio (NIO) rose after giving strong deliveries and revenue guidance for the current quarter, with auto demand in China rebounding.Story continuesElsewhere in markets, US crude oil futures added to gains after rising by the most in nearly 3 weeks as of Monday\u2019s settlement. Gold stumbled below $2,000 per ounce, falling by the most since March. Treasury yields rose as prices fell.Investor attention also remained locked on prospects of further fiscal stimulus from Congress, after President Donald Trump over the weekend unleashed a set of executive orders to provide some economic support without congressional action. The moves have already led some states to push back, and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the order to have states chalk up a portion of the funds the proposed enhanced unemployment benefit \u201conly digs the hole deeper\u201d for states already grappling with budget deficits. Further stimulus discussions in Congress, however, hang in abeyance.During remarks late Monday, Trump added that he was considering a capital gains tax cut.\u20144:17 p.m. ET: Joe Biden, presumptive Democratic nominee, selects Sen.

I think there\u2019s the view that whoever the potential winner is, that the vaccine will be here and that things will recover,\u201d Hartman said during Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cThe First Trade.\u201d\u201cClearly there are differences in the positions of the parties. And on the margin one could argue that depending on your political view, one party may stimulate the economy more than the other,\u201d he added. \u201cI think right now the market is kind of discounting that and looking at the fact that the Fed this year \u2013 we\u2019ve got the Fed put. There\u2019s a lot of stimulus in the market, the money supply\u2019s up 20%, and corporate earnings look pretty good next year. Right now I would say it\u2019s not really too focused on the election.\u201d\u20149:35 a.m. ET: S&P 500, Dow open higher; Nasdaq declines againHere were the main moves in markets, as of 9:35 a.m. ET:S&P 500 (^GSPC): +12.87 points (+0.38%) to 3,373.34Dow (^DJI): +324.59 points (+1.17%) to 28,116.03Nasdaq (^IXIC): -83.26 points (-0.8%) to 10,885.10Crude (CL=F): +$0.80 (+1.91%) to $42.74 a barrelGold (GC=F): -$79.30 (-3.89%) to $1,960.40 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): +6.4 bps to yield 0.638%\u20149:26 a.m. ET: General Motors\u2019 CFO Dhivya Suryadevara resignsGeneral Motors (GM) announced Tuesday its Chief Financial Officer Dhivya Suryadevara was resigning to pursue an opportunity outside the auto industry.
