And Harvard Public Health professor Dr. Howard Koh says the U.S. needs to take a step back and do a better job and battling the coronavirus as a country.\u201cWe are now seeing record cases and rising deaths for the first time in three months,\u201d Koh said on Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade (video above). \u201cSo we\u2019re in the public health fight of our lives right now. This is a time where our country needs to regroup.\u201dU.S. President Donald Trump wears a protective mask while visiting Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, U.S., on Saturday, July 11, 2020. (Chris Kleponis/Polaris/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, echoed Koh\u2019s statements.\u201cWe have got to say, this is not working,\u201d Fauci told PBS Newshour. \u201dSo what we have got to do is reset. You may need to pull back a bit on a phase. You don't necessarily need to lock down.\u201d\u2018This has been an abject failure on the part of the federal government\u2019Koh explained that part of the problem is governors diverging on the best approach to containing the spread of the virus in their respective states.\u201cWe\u2019re now six months and counting into the worst pandemic our country has faced in a century,\u201d Koh said. \u201cSo many other countries around the world have gotten to the other side of this and we, the United States, have not. That\u2019s because we have not had national coordination or national strategy. We\u2019ve had 50 states going in 50 different directions.\u201dNot every state has a mask mandate. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)Face masks are proven to make a significant difference in stopping the spread of the coronavirus, but only 19 states have mandates for residents to wear them in both outdoor and indoor public places.\u201cI\u2019m really hoping at this time that every leader at the federal, state, and local level focuses on maximizing the public health measures we have, and maximizing masking,\u201d Koh said. \u201cWe should have a national requirement for mask usage by now. I\u2019m not sure why it hasn\u2019t happened yet.\u201dStory continuesPeople wearing face masks wait in line to shop at Ikea in Carson, California on July 4, 2020 the US Independence Day holiday.

Seven states only mandate masks for those in indoor public places. Two-thirds of Americans polled say everyone should be wearing masks in public.\u201cThis has been an abject failure on the part of the federal government,\u201d Dr. Craig Spencer, an emergency medicine physician and director of Global Health in Emergency Medicine at Columbia University, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of a raging pandemic, and we\u2019re having discussions about resuming some semblance of normal life.\u201dWhere coronavirus was getting worse last week. (David Foster/Yahoo Finance)\u2018We have to get this down now before the fall comes\u2019Numerous companies are working towards finding a vaccine for the coronavirus, but the absolute earliest it would be available in emergency cases would be late 2020/early 2021.\u201cWe\u2019re all looking for the best cures and there have been advances in therapeutics but we don\u2019t have a cure yet,\u201d Koh said. \u201cWe\u2019re all looking for a vaccine but that hasn\u2019t been finalized or approved by the FDA yet.\u201dResearch assistant Yi Kuo, of RNA medicines company Arcturus Therapeutics, conducts research on a vaccine for the novel coronavirus at a laboratory in San Diego, California. REUTERS/Bing GuanUntil a vaccine becomes widely available to the public, which will take longer, the U.S. is only left with preventative measures.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to take those public health and prevention measures and maximize this right now, and hit that virus with everything we got,\u201d Koh said. \u201cThat includes social distancing, hand hygiene, and masks, which are on the news a lot these days. We have to get this down now before the fall comes and seasonal flu hits us as well.\u201dAdriana is a reporter and editor covering politics and health care policy for Yahoo Finance.
