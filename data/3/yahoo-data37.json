The results were gloomy with respondents expecting conditions to worsen on all 10 issues we asked about.We followed up this past weekend. The responses a second time around \u2013 with the chaotic 2020 campaign in its final stretch \u2013 were even worse.For the 10 issues discussed, Americans were asked: \u201cHow much better or worse do you think each of the following will be three months from now?\u201dDavid Foster/Yahoo FinanceOn nearly every issue, not only did a plurality of Americans expect conditions to worsen but more answered negatively this time around than they did in the summer.\"What we are seeing is a reflection of the volatility that is happening in the marketplace and with certain policy actions,\" said Amir Kanpurwala, the Harris Poll Managing Director of Brand Strategy, in a Yahoo Finance interview to discuss the polls findings.He added that the stalemate in Washington over more stimulus is making people more concerned \"about the U.S. economy and about things like having a job, issues with the healthcare system, public safety so on and so forth.\"The sour mood is reflected across a range of other public data. A recent Ipsos poll conducted for Thomson Reuters found that 66% of U.S. adults believe that the country is \u201coff on the wrong track.\u201dThe survey was conducted before the chaos this week over additional stimulus negotiations that saw President Trump initially saying the country needs stimulus, then announcing \"I have instructed my representatives to stop negotiating,\" before reversing course again and asking for piecemeal measures as the markets bounced up and down.Public safety, coronavirus, and the economyPerhaps pointing to the possibility of a contested election, 49% of respondents to the Harris survey predicted that public safety would get much worse or somewhat worse between now and the eve of the next presidential inauguration.
