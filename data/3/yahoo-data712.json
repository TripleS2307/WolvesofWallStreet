Restaurants of all kinds are closing in the city at the hands of the pandemic. Ditto major retail chains.Yet, Krispy Kreme is about to swing open the doors on Sept. 15 to a true doughnut making funland smack in the middle of nearly empty Times Square. Some of the features of the store include the \u201cworld\u2019s largest\u201d hot light, a glazed waterfall where people could watch doughnuts being dipped and a 24-hour street level pick-up window.The 4,500-square-foot store has been three years in the making, Krispy Kreme CEO Mike Tattersfield told Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade. For Tattersfield \u2014 a restaurant industry veteran that was once the CEO of Caribou Coffee \u2014 opening the store despite the concerns about weak city traffic and shopper health still makes a great deal of sense.Krispy Kreme's new 4,500-square-foot store in Times Square New York City. Credit: Krispy Kreme\u201cWe\u2019ve been looking to invest in New York. We have had a shop in Penn Station since 1997. So we saw the demand. It\u2019s a very craveable brand,\u201d Tattersfield said. Krispy Kreme will not only use the store as a marketing mechanism for the brand, but to sell doughnuts wholesale to nearby businesses. Tattersfield mentioned the store will supply pharmacy chain Duane Reade (via a new deal) and Walmart (also a new deal).Krispy Kreme was acquired by food conglomerate JAB Holdings for $1.35 billion in 2016. The company has gone from 1,100 stores in 26 countries at the time of the deal, to 1,500 locations spanning 33 countries. Sales have reached $1 billion annually, up from more than $500 million at the time of JAB\u2019s purchase. Tattersfield expects to open another 450 stores by the end of 2022.Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
