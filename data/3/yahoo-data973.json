But others, like Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, have kept bars and indoor dining open despite warnings from the federal government that they increase the likelihood of spread.As of July 29, coronavirus cases were increasing in 29 states, according to the New York Times. The U.S. leads the world in coronavirus cases and deaths, with 4.3 million cases and 149,000 deaths, Johns Hopkins University reported.\u201cThis has been a huge tragedy,\u201d Gates says. \u201cWe need to stop this thing.\u201dStory continuesGates, who serves as co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, made the remarks to Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer in an episode of Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cInfluencers with Andy Serwer,\u201d a weekly interview series with leaders in business, politics, and entertainment.Until 2000, Gates led personal computing giant Microsoft. That year, he and his wife Melinda co-founded their foundation, which now employs nearly 1,500 people and boasts an endowment of $46.8 billion.Areas spared by the pandemic in its early months will be more vulnerable in the autumn, Gates said.\u201cPart of the irony is that it's the communities that haven't had it badly who are going to be most at risk in the fall,\u201d he says. \u201cWe saw in the spring, a lot of cities were saying, \u2018well, we're not New York.\u2019\u201dRead more:Bill Gates: Spread of 'outrageous' coronavirus video shows flaw in social media platforms'Travel has changed forever': Airbnb CEO Brian CheskyJump into stock market expecting rise 'a fool's errand': Billionaire investor David RubensteinBusiness leaders fear 'flaming on social media' if they criticize Trump: Fast Company Editor-in-ChiefMichael Dell: \u2018Not enough\u2019 progress on diversity in the tech industry\u2018We may need to quarantine our books' when libraries reopen, New York Public Library CEO saysRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"}]}
