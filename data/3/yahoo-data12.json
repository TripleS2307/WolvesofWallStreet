The Nasdaq underperformed, dropping 1%.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had been slated to hold more discussions around the size of another round of virus-related relief measures on Tuesday, following about a week of regular phone calls over the package. The negotiators had so far remained at an impasse over the dollar sum of the next round of relief, with Mnuchin last offering a deal worth about $1.6 trillion.Other policymakers have called for further fiscal stimulus in the near-term to help support the economy. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, in virtual remarks during the National Association for Business Economics\u2019 Annual Meeting, re-upped his assertion that further fiscal support would help promote a faster economic recovery when working alongside the Federal Reserve\u2019s own efforts.\u201cThe recovery will be stronger and move faster if monetary policy and fiscal policy continue to work side by side to provide support to the economy until it is clearly out of the woods,\u201d Powell said.Meanwhile, investors also continued to eye developments around the election in light of Trump\u2019s recent Covid-19 diagnosis. Trump departed Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Monday to return to the White House, just days after entering the hospital on Friday to be treated. White House physician Dr. Sean Conley said Trump had \u201cmet or exceeded all standard hospital discharge criteria,\u201d while conceding that he \u201cmay not be entirely out of the woods yet\u201d in his recovery process.Story continuesIn the days since, Vice President Joe Biden has widened his lead in a number of recent polls capturing the period following the Trump\u2019s positive Covid-19 test. A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted Oct. 2-3 showed Biden ahead by 10 percentage points, for an increase in his lead since the period after the first presidential debate but before Trump announced his virus test result.Lisa Shalett, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management chief investment officer, told Yahoo Finance on Monday that the widening in the polls \u2013 more so than the candidate in the lead himself \u2013 helped remove an element of uncertainty that had recently been weighing on stocks.\u201cAs the polls widen, the only thing that that\u2019s telling you is that the odds of this being an election that doesn\u2019t get decided for weeks or months perhaps comes off the table,\u201d Shalett said. \u201cAnd I think that last week and the last week in September was really dominated by that, where people were less concerned about who wins, and this idea that somehow our democracy was going to be so challenged that we weren\u2019t going to know the results of a presidential election unless it went to court.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think investors want this to go to court, regardless of whether the winner has a blue shirt or a red shirt at the end of the day,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd I think that with widening polls that possibility gets taken off the table and so a little bit of risk premium comes out.\u201dOthers, however, maintained that investors were more specifically pricing in the rising likelihood of a Biden presidency and potential for a Democratic sweep.\u201cTo me, the optimism in the market has to do with an increased conviction that Joe Biden will win [the presidency] and that will bring in a Blue Wave which in turn, will bring a large fiscal stimulus package early next year,\u201d Isaac Boltansky, Compass Point Research director of policy research, told Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade.\u20144:04 p.m. ET: Dow drops 376 points, or 1.3%, after Trump calls for an end to stimulus talks until after the electionHere were the main moves in markets as of 4:04 p.m. ET:S&P 500 (^GSPC): -47.68 (-1.40%) to 3,360.95Dow (^DJI): -375.88 (-1.34%) to 27,772.76Nasdaq (^IXIC): -177.88 (-1.57%) to 11,154.60Crude (CL=F): +$0.82 (+2.09%) to $40.04 a barrelGold (GC=F): -$27.00 (-1.41%) to $1,893.10 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): -2 bps to yield 0.7420%\u20142:54 p.m. ET: Trump says he is \u2018rejecting\u2019 House Democrats\u2019 $2.4 trillion virus relief packagePresident Donald Trump wrote in a set of Twitter posts Tuesday afternoon that he would be \u201crejecting\u201d House Democrats\u2019 $2.4 trillion virus relief proposal, which the chamber voted to advance on Thursday.\u201cNancy Pelosi is asking for $2.4 Trillion Dollars to bailout poorly run, high crime, Democrat States, money that is in no way related to COVID-19,\u201d Trump wrote in the post. \u201cWe made a very generous offer of $1.6 Trillion Dollars and, as usual, she is not negotiating in good faith.
