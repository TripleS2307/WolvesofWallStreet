Yet on Monday, the president threw the process into a new twist by floating the idea that any sale to an American company should also require a payment to the U.S. Treasury.Trump told reporters that \u201ca very substantial portion of that price is going to have to come into the Treasury of the United States...because we're making it possible for this deal to happen. Right now [TikTok doesn\u2019t] have any rights, unless we give it to them.\u201dMicrosoft (MSFT) confirmed discussions with ByteDance to explore a purchase of TikTok\u2019s service in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and that the two companies had notified the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). That body initiates, reviews, investigates, and mitigates existing and prospective foreign transactions to protect national security.However, it\u2019s unclear whether TikTok or Microsoft would be expected to pay the president\u2019s proposed fee, which would potentially drive up the cost for an American company to acquire the platform. ByteDance investors recently valued TikTok at $50 billion, according to Reuters.In the company\u2019s blog post, Microsoft said it \u201cfully appreciates the importance of addressing the President\u2019s concerns\u201d and is \u201ccommitted to acquiring TikTok subject to a complete security review and providing proper economic benefits to the U.S.. including the U.S. Treasury.\u201dStory continuesIn an email to Yahoo Finance, the software giant offered no further comment beyond its original statement.White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow told Fox Business News on Tuesday that there was \u201cno specific blueprint\u201d for the President\u2019s proposed payment. However, Trump\u2019s unusual request touched off a spirited debate about whether it was permissible under the law \u2014 and experts have their doubts.\u201cI\u2019m not aware of anyone having been required to compensate the U.S. government for its efforts during a CFIUS review, mitigation, or divestment,\u201d Jonathan Gafni, an attorney with Linklaters LLP and a former official with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), told Yahoo Finance.David Hall, a partner with the law firm and co-chair of its CFIUS practice for Wiggin and Dana LLP, said CFIUS alone has no legal authority to impose an extra payment beyond its usual fees and mitigation requirements.While Trump has ultimate authority to unravel foreign investments, his power to impose a payment for the benefit of the U.S. Treasury in connection with mitigation requirements is questionable, Hall explained.\u201cThere's not any authority for a side payment,\u201d he said, adding that it would be \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d if Microsoft voluntarily paid a fee because it could set a precedent that the way a foreign company or individual can get approval in a U.S. national security review is to pay the U.S. government.Esta imagen del viernes 17 de julio de 2020 muestra a un hombre con una camiseta que promueve la aplicaci\u00f3n TikTok en una tienda Apple, en Beijing.

Therefore, if a Treasury payment were wrapped up in its conditions to approve a deal, the parties subject to it would have no resource within the legal system to challenge it.Hall and Gafni explained that CFIUS\u2019 authority does permit it to impose fines and penalties for failing to file for foreign investment review, and to require parties to take mitigation steps that are often expensive.Review fees can range into the hundreds of thousands of dollars for larger transactions. And mitigation conditions often require parties to undertake capital or operational expenditures \u2014 such as changing directors and officers, installing new physical access controls, and hiring third-party monitoring and auditing firms.Meanwhile, there\u2019s little doubt that TikTok is worth its weight in gold to a potential suitor, given its popularity among younger users. According to a survey conducted by Piper Sandler in February and March, TikTok\u2019s U.S. mobile app is used by approximately 62% of American teenagers.The data showed the company in third place among American teens, behind Instagram (85%) and Snapchat (82%).Alexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.
