The frontline battle has shifted to states like California, Texas, Florida, Arizona, all of which are responding to surging case counts by rolling back phased reopening plans.Those areas are also mandating masks and closing beaches; meanwhile, states like New Jersey and New York \u2014 which have recovered from the darkest days of the outbreak \u2014 are also taking precautions by halting plans to reopen indoor dining.New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy announced this week he would reverse the decision to allow indoor dining in time for the holiday weekend. New York City followed suit Wednesday, with Mayor Bill DeBlasio saying indoor dining would be paused and outdoor dining would be expanded\u2014 with more than 6,600 restaurants taking advantage the city\u2019s initiative to qualify restaurants for outdoor dining.\u201cIt is not the time to forge ahead with indoor dining,\u201d DeBlasio said, citing the nationwide surge in COVID-19 cases. \u201cI am very convinced we can help restaurants survive, and help bring a lot more revenue to them. We can help bring back a lot of jobs, but do it safely and do it outdoors.\u201dHe referenced Dr. Anthony Fauci\u2019s testimony in front of a Senate panel Tuesday as a key reason to remain wary of the outbreak. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the country \u2014 which as already doubled from a daily average of 20,000 to 40,000 cases \u2014 could end up seeing 100,000 cases per day if the surge continues.Coronavirus cases are increasing in the Sun Belt region.

In both cases, there will be extra regulatory scrutiny as the technology has no precedent on the market.The company tested three different strength doses in 45 participants aged 18-55, and showed neutralizing antibodies were produced at higher levels with the two lower doses. This is ideal for the company as it means less materials required per dose and more vaccine production.While no vaccines have been approved, the global race is heating up with various companies pushing ahead as quickly as possible. Inovio (INO), an early entrant among the smaller biotech players, announced early positive results Tuesday, but has not yet provided study details.The path toward a vaccine is the U.S.\u2019s \u201cManhattan Project,\u201d said Declan Quirke, Stifel Healthcare Group\u2019s co-head, but even with multiple parties working on a solution, \u201cit\u2019s still going to take time.\u201dMeanwhile, in the treatment space, Gilead (GILD) is under fire again as the U.S. announced it would buy the majority of the company\u2019s supply of the antiviral drug remdesivir.The U.S. Health and Human Services Department (HHS) announced it would be buying half a million treatment courses \u2014 the entire supply for the company for July and a majority of the supply for August and September.\u201cPresident Trump has struck an amazing deal to ensure Americans have access to the first authorized therapeutic for COVID-19,\u201d HHS Sec. Alex Azar said in a prepared statement.\u201cTo the extent possible, we want to ensure that any American patient who needs remdesivir can get it,\u201d he added.Anticipating the unprecedented need, Gilead issued voluntary non-exclusive licenses to five generic manufacturers in May. But with a production time of more than six months, that would mean these companies would likely have their first batch produced by late fall at the earliest. Only 10% of the company\u2019s supply would be distributed globally in the meantime.This has many experts concerned about the U.S.-produced vaccines, and how protectionism will play a role in the distribution of a successful candidate.Anjalee Khemlani is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
