(Interestingly, for now, the Pixar movie \u201cSoul\u201d is still set for a Nov. 20, 2020 theatrical release.)Disney also delayed two 20th Century Studios movies: Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cWest Side Story\u201d from Dec. 18, 2020 to Dec. 10, 2021; and Kenneth Branagh\u2019s Agatha Christie adaptation \u201cDeath On The Nile\u201d from Oct. 23, 2020 to Dec. 18, 2020.These delays come one week after Warner Bros. (T) delayed \u201cWonder Woman 1984\u201d from Oct. 2 to Christmas Day. It\u2019s the third time the film has been delayed due to the pandemic.(L-R) David Harbour, Florence Pugh, O-T Fagbenle, Rachel Weisz and Scarlett Johansson of Marvel Studios' 'Black Widow' at the San Diego Comic-Con International 2019 Marvel Studios Panel in Hall H on July 20, 2019 in San Diego, California. (Photo by Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images for Disney)\u201cTenet\u201d has now grossed more than its $200 million budget globally, but has disappointed in the U.S. Its U.S. opening pulled in $20 million, according to initial reports, but that figure was massaged to include preview screenings in the week before, according to Variety. From Friday to Sunday, its first three days in U.S. theaters, the film actually sold only $9 million in tickets. (To be fair, movie theaters have not reopened in New York City or Los Angeles, two key U.S. theatrical markets.)Story continues\u201cMulan\u201d has had its own trouble. The movie has faced political backlash in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and elsewhere for filming parts in Xinjiang, where Uighur Muslims have been detained in detention camps, and for a 2019 tweet from star by Liu Yifei expressing support for Hong Kong police.Theatrical numbers have slid quickly in China, where \u201cMulan\u201d had earned $36.5 million as of Sept. 21, while \u201cTenet\u201d (which opened in China one week before \u201cMulan\u201d) had earned nearly double that, $61.4 million, by the same date.As for how \u201cMulan\u201d has fared on Disney+, Disney has only said that it is \u201cvery pleased\u201d with the initial results, and that from Sept. 1 through Sept. 12, nearly 29% of U.S. Disney+ users purchased the film. (Disney said in August that Disney+ had amassed 60.5 million subscribers, but it hasn\u2019t broken out how many of those are in the U.S.)As the pandemic drags on, American movie theaters will anxiously await more big movies to lure mask-wearing moviegoers. AMC in August restructured its $5 billion in debt and issued new shares in order to narrowly avoid filing for bankruptcy.\u2014Daniel Roberts is an editor-at-large at Yahoo Finance and closely covers the streaming wars.
