You do it progressively. ... Absolutely no surprise that you\u2019re getting the increase and no one should be shocked.\u201dThere are over 2 million coronavirus cases in the U.S. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)\u2018Look at New York, look at Pennsylvania\u2019States that previously seemed unscathed at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic are now seeing significant increases in COVID-related hospitalizations and deaths.On Monday, Texas reported record highs in COVID hospitalizations, the fourth day in a row with a new high. There are currently over 2,000 patients with the coronavirus in the state, with increases presumably stemming from Memorial Day weekend activities.Florida, another state that reopened early, is experiencing similar troubles. On Tuesday morning, the state reported 2,783 coronavirus cases, which was the highest number in a single day, according to Florida\u2019s health department data. There are now more than 80,000 cases in Florida and more than 3,000 deaths.Coronavirus cases are increasing in Florida. (Chart: Florida Department of Health)\u201cIf you actually look at the states, what you can see clearly is that when they rushed to reopen, four weeks later almost to the day, you see the beginning of this exponential increase in the number of cases,\u201d said Emanuel, who is currently Vice Provost for Global Initiatives and chair of the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cAnd that, several weeks later, will increase the number of hospitalizations and deaths.\u201dStory continuesOther states in the Northeast held off on beginning their phased re-openings until they were satisfied that every requirement had been met.\u201cLook at New York, look at Pennsylvania, look at Illinois, and if you slowly ease up in the right way, you can actually keep those numbers down,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cThe issue is to do it in the right way and at the right time, and that\u2019s what Florida and Texas and Arizona have not done.\u201dCases are declining in New York, but rising in other parts of the U.S. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)Lockdowns: Temporary solutionsThe U.S. has the highest case count and death count in the world, far ahead of countries like China, where the virus originated, and Italy, the European epicenter of the virus.And although the number of cases keep rising, President Trump and Vice President Pence have attributed it to increased testing \u2014 although experts say this isn\u2019t accurate.There are over 8 million coronavirus cases worldwide. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)\u201cI think the president, the administration, now wants to pretend that COVID doesn\u2019t exist and minimize its impact,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cBut we\u2019re at 115,000 deaths and before the end of the year, we\u2019re almost certainly going to be at 250,000 deaths or more, and that is a huge increase in our death rate in the United States, and I think pretty unacceptable.\u201dThere are several factors that need to come together in order for the U.S. to fully gain control over the spread of the virus.A shopper wearing a facemask carries a dog through the Mall of America on June 16, 2020 in Bloomington, Minnesota, after some of the shops at the mall reopened on June 10. (Photo: KEREM YUCEL/AFP via Getty Images)\u201cA lockdown is only a temporary measure to get in place a testing regime, a contact tracing regime, and an ability to isolate the few cases that arise,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cAnd you can see when you put in all the public health measures \u2014 the lockdown, physical distancing, the face mask wearing, the hand hygiene, the closing of businesses, the limiting of crowds \u2014 you get a nice decline.\u201dAdriana is a reporter and editor covering politics and health care policy for Yahoo Finance.
