But despite the app\u2019s uncertain future, Paris Hilton, arguably the world\u2019s original influencer, couldn\u2019t be more bullish on the video-sharing social network.\u201cMy favorite app is TikTok. I'm having so much fun on there. I just love the platform. I love the editing. I love all the different things that you could do. I love all the challenges, the music. I just think it's so creative and fun,\u201d Hilton told Yahoo Finance in an interview ahead of the premiere of her documentary, \u201cThis is Paris,\u201d which debuted on YouTube today.She added: \u201cAnd if someone loves to dance or they want to do comedy or beauty, there's just \u2014 you basically could do anything. And it\u2019s just... the innovation is amazing, and it's just more fun than any of the other platforms. I just have a good time with it.\u201dHilton, 39, the heiress to the Hilton Hotels (HLT) empire, has 3 million followers on TikTok, whose owner just proposed partnering with enterprise software provider Oracle (ORCL) in the U.S. amid the Trump administration\u2019s protests that TikTok poses a threat to national security.Last week, Hilton started the #ThatsHot challenge, paying homage to her signature line, trying to get creators to use the hashtag to get on Hilton\u2019s radar \u2014 the only rule is \u201cdon\u2019t be boring.\u201d The hashtag was viewed 1 billion times within the first 24 hours.
