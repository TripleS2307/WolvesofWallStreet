SubscribeThings could be worse, but this doesn\u2019t make them good.The U.S. economic recovery slowed in September, according to economists.But given the absence of new stimulus and the continued spread of COVID-19, this growth-at-a-slower-pace outcome suggests the recovery may continue even in the absence of a new stimulus package.And the fact that the economy isn\u2019t in an outright contraction is a nice upside surprise given that fresh stimulus had been seen as essential for any recovery to continue just a few months back.\u201cThe pace of economic recovery has slowed in the last month, but that is arguably still an impressive result given the surge in coronavirus cases over the summer, and the more recent expiry of the enhanced unemployment benefits,\u201d said Paul Ashworth, an economist at Capital Economics in a note on Thursday.Retail sales, for instance, are back above pre-pandemic levels. But consumption in the services sector \u2014 such as at restaurants, where much of current unemployment is focused \u2014 has slowed at levels well below those that prevailed last year.September\u2019s data also showed a temporary pop from the Labor Day holiday, with economists at Bank of America Global Research noting that seated diners, according to OpenTable and TSA passenger data, both took a step back last week after a pop around the holiday.Like Capital Economics, however, Bank of America also sees a recovery that continues to be quite resilient. \u201cBottom line: Labor Day has distorted the signal from many of the high frequency indicators that we track,\u201d the firm said in a report published Wednesday.\u201cHowever, the New York Fed weekly economic index and Dallas mobility and engagement index continue to signal that the recovery has continued in September, but there is still a long road ahead before the economy is fully healed.\u201dOver at Oxford Economics, Gregory Daco notes that the firm\u2019s proprietary recovery tracker index fell for week ended September 4 \u2014 the most recent week for which the firm has complete data \u2014 though most of this decline was due to the selloff in markets that tightened financial conditions.Story continuesDaco is also tracking concerning signs in the labor market, however, where gains slowed in early September at both the national and regional level.\u201cEmployment continued to climb on stronger job openings and increased employment at small businesses, but momentum slowed,\u201d Daco writes. Adding that, \u201cregional labor market recoveries have lost strength, posing a risk to consumer spending absent additional fiscal aid.\u201dThe labor market recovery lost momentum in early September while overall activity has been resilient even amid the absence of additional fiscal stimulus. (Source: Oxford Economics)But given the mid-summer conversation about a \u201cbenefits cliff\u201d the economy has now walked off with the CARES Act expiring at the end of July, a slowing but not contracting economy is a positive and surprising development.Which suggests a more durable recovery is possible if either a vaccine is available earlier than expected or fiscal stimulus is made available to consumers in the months ahead.But these positive developments are far from an all-clear that the pandemic-induced downturn is behind us and that further diligence isn\u2019t warranted.\u201cActivity in the housing sector has returned to its level at the beginning of the year, and we are starting to see signs of an improvement in business investment,\u201d Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday. \u201cThe recovery has progressed more quickly than generally expected, and forecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year have been revised up since our June Summary of Economic Projections.\u201d\u201cEven so, overall activity remains well below its level before the pandemic and the path ahead remains highly uncertain,\u201d Powell said.Adding: \u201cA full economic recovery is unlikely until people are confident that it is safe to re-engage in a broad range of activities.\u201dBy Myles Udland, reporter and co-anchor of The Final Round.
