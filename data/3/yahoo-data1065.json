Reports of additional stimulus from the Trump administration in the form of a $1 trillion infrastructure package, along with hopes that a common drug could help treat coronavirus patients, also helped catalyze the rally.[Click here to read what\u2019s moving markets heading into Wednesday, June 17]Retail sales jumped by a record 17.7% in May over April, coming in at more than double the consensus estimate for a rise of 8.4%. This followed a record 14.7% plunge in retail sales in April, with the reversal suggesting consumer spending was picking back up as businesses began to reopen in May.\u201cWe\u2019ve been used to seeing record lows in economic fundamentals over the past few months and to see the pendulum swing so far in the other direction is nothing if not encouraging,\u201d Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy for E-Trade Financial Corporation, said in an email Tuesday. \u201cLooking at this morning\u2019s number in aggregate, this is another indicator that a v-shaped recovery could be more likely than we initially thought.\u201dSeparately, investors also eyed multiple reports stating that the widely used steroid dexamethasone helped reduce the death rate of patients with severe cases of Covid-19, according to trial results.The moves higher in equities sent the three major indices higher for a third straight session.Tuesday\u2019s developments added to the risk-on mood sparked after the Federal Reserve announced Monday it was expanding its own stimulus program for the virus-stricken economy. The Fed said it would begin purchasing individual corporate bonds as part of its emergency lending program, expanding the Fed\u2019s previously announced Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility, which had until Monday only included purchases of exchange-traded funds.\u201cI think what they\u2019re trying to get away from is the perception that they\u2019re favoring one company or one industry over another so they try to spread it out,\u201d Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab, told Yahoo Finance\u2019s The Ticker of the announcement. \u201cBut again, the bonds have to meet their criteria, which means they\u2019re not buying the lowest credit quality bonds in the high yield market. They\u2019re going to be buying those with higher credit ratings and up to a five-year maturity.\u201dStory continuesThe slew of more positive economic data combined with additional stimulus news at least temporarily diverted investor attention from signs of increasing coronavirus cases in some parts of the country. Texas and Florida each reported record new coronavirus cases earlier this week, and other states including Arizona and California have also recently seen renewed increases in cases with their own reopenings under way.Travel and leisure stocks including American Airlines, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, Royal Caribbean International and Hilton \u2013 which have seen their shares mostly move in lockstep in recent weeks with states\u2019 reopenings under way \u2013 gained in late trading.\u20144:05 p.m. ET: Stocks rise for third straight session after record retail sales jumpHere were the main moves in markets as of 4:05 p.m. ET:S&P 500 (^GSPC): +58.15 (+1.90%) to 3,124.74Dow (^DJI): +526.82 (+2.04%) to 26,289.98Nasdaq (^IXIC): +169.84 (+1.75%) to 9,895.87Crude (CL=F): +$1.05 (+2.83%) to $38.17 a barrelGold (GC=F): +$7.30 (+0.42%) to $1,734.50 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): +5.4 bps to yield 0.7560%\u201412:31 p.m. ET: Stocks hold higher as session rolls onHere were the main moves in markets, as of 12:31 p.m. ET:S&P 500 (^GSPC): +58.02 points (+1.89%) to 3,124.61Dow (^DJI): +555.1 points (+2.15%) to 26,318.26Nasdaq (^IXIC): +161.64 points (+1.66%) to 9,887.66Crude (CL=F): +$0.26 (+0.7%) to $37.38 a barrelGold (GC=F): +$8.60 (+0.5%) to $1,735.80 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): +4.9 bps to yield 0.751%\u201410:17 a.m. ET: Powell says full recovery \u2018unlikely\u2019 until public views virus as containedFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell began delivering his Semiannual Monetary Policy Report to Congress Tuesday morning, reiterating the Federal Reserve\u2019s cautious stance on the pace of the economic recovery as the coronavirus pandemic continues in the U.S.\u201cSignificant uncertainty remains about the timing and strength of the recovery,\u201d Powell said in prepared remarks. \u201cMuch of that economic uncertainty comes from uncertainty about the path of the disease and the effects of measures to contain it. Until the public is confident that the disease is contained, a full recovery is unlikely.\u201dStill, Powell noted that \u201csome indicators have pointed to a stabilization, and in some areas a modest rebound, in economic activity,\u201d highlighting the much stronger than expected May jobs report.\u201410:03 a.m. ET: National Association of Home Builders index rises more than expected, showing \u2018housing well-positioned to lead the economy forward\u2019The National Association of Home Builders\u2019 (NAHB) confidence index for builders rose by 21 points to 58 in June, coming in above the 45 print expected by consensus economists.

And buyer traffic more than doubled in one month even as builders report growing online and phone inquiries stemming from the outbreak.\u201d\u201410:01 a.m. ET: Business inventories fell more than expected in AprilU.S. business inventories fell by more than expected in April as the coronavirus pandemic weighed on imports and global commerce.Business inventories dropped by 1.3% in April, extending a 0.3% drop from March.
