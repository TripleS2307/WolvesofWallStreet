One year later, the White House extended it in order for the administration to continue using the funds taken from the budgets of various agencies.CBP data indicates that more barriers are set to be built. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)Jim Carroll, the director of the U.S. Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), explained why he is in favor of building more barriers.\u201cWhat a wall does is it\u2019s a force multiplier,\u201d Carroll told Yahoo Finance in an interview. \u201cBecause if you\u2019re down there, you see these wide open stretches. As a result, Border Patrol has to be all along there. By building the wall, what we\u2019re doing is following people to a certain area.\u201dView of the metal fence along the border in Sonoyta, Sonora state, northern Mexico, between the Altar desert in Mexico and the Arizona desert in the United States, on March 27, 2017. (Photo: PEDRO PARDO/AFP via Getty Images)In early 2016, then-candidate Trump asserted that his wall \u201cis going to be a real wall, it\u2019s going to be a high wall, it\u2019s going to be a beautiful wall,\u201d that it would cost \u201cmaybe $10 or $12 billion,\u201d and that \"Mexico will pay for the wall \u2014 100%!\u201dHowever, this turned out not to be the case. Instead, the Trump administration requested funds through the 2020 defense spending bill but received less than what was asked for. Eventually, the demand for the border \u201cwall\u201d led to a 35-day shutdown from Dec. 22 to Jan. 25, until Congress approved an additional $1.4 billion for border building.About 44% of Americans agree with the idea of building a wall along the border, according to a December 2019 Fox News poll.U.S. President Donald Trump calls up Blake Marnell, wearing a jacket with bricks representing a border wall, to the stage during a 'Make America Great Again' campaign rally in Montoursville, Pennsylvania.

(Photo: John Moore/Getty Images)\u201cThey\u2019re no longer working to provide humanitarian relief,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cThey can get back to the mission of stopping the flow. The flow is not changed\u2026 What we need to do now is secure that border to be able to know exactly what is coming in. Someone else can worry about who is coming in. I worry about what is coming in. That\u2019s my mission.\u201dStory continuesCBP seized 2,545 pounds of fentanyl, 5,427 pounds of heroin, 68,585 pounds of methamphetamine, 89,207 pounds of cocaine, and 289,529 pounds of marijuana at lawful points of entry in the 2019 fiscal year. At unlawful points of entry, 266,882 pounds of marijuana, 14,434 pounds of methamphetamine, 226 pounds of fentanyl, 808 pounds of heroin, and 11,682 pounds of cocaine were seized that same year.Drug seizures increased for all but cocaine in the 2018 fiscal year. (Chart: Congressional Research Service)These areas include high intensity drug trafficking areas, known as HIDTAs. There are currently 33 throughout the country. According to the ONDCP, the HIDTA program \u201cdismantled nearly 3,000 drug trafficking organizations, removed $16.5 billion in the wholesale value of drugs from the street, and made nearly 99,000 arrests\u201d in 2018.\u201cWe want to make sure that we continue to research, but we also make sure that we have the ability to go after and prosecute traffickers,\u201d Carroll said.Carroll stressed that \u201cthe best approach\u201d towards people with addiction is \u201ctreatment, not incarceration.\u201d However, he also believes that drug traffickers should face justice.The Southwest border is a major spot for drug trafficking. (Map: ONDCP)\u201cThe people who are trafficking, who are selling this, who have an addiction to greed and are just lining their wallets, those people need the full force, weight, and justice of the American system to come after them,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cThose people who are preying on the victims of the disease of addiction have no right to be able to remain free. Those are not the people for diversion courts. They have an addiction to greed. Those people are traffickers and those are the people that need to be held accountable.\u201dHe continued: \u201cDrug traffickers ... are vastly different than someone on the street who is feeding an addiction by saying, \u2018I bought this for $10. Give me $5 and we can share it.\u2019 We\u2019re talking about true traffickers. The traffickers have no barriers, no regulation, and they have finance, they have money. They\u2019re willing to use any method they can to be able to do this.\u201dDirector of Office of National Drug Control Policy Jim Carroll speaks during a news briefing at the James Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House January 30, 2020 in Washington, DC. (Photo: Alex Wong/Getty Images)\u2018China was becoming the drug dealer of the world\u2019Carroll noted that U.S. actions led China to reduce the flow of deadly fentanyl from China to Mexico, thereby reducing the amount of fentanyl into the U.S.Fentanyl is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine. And according to the National Institute of Health (NIH), \u201csynthetic opioids, including fentanyl, are now the most common drugs involved in drug overdose deaths in the United States.\u201dSynthetic opioids like fentanyl accounted for nearly 70% of all drug overdose deaths in 2018.Fentanyl deaths have spiked over recent years. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)Back in November 2019, China cracked down on its fentanyl manufacturers by convicting nine people of smuggling the drug into the U.S., which ONDCP described as \u201ca positive step.\u201d\u201cAll we have to do is look at the results and see that the work we have done in China on this issue is paying off,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cWe talk about a dramatic reduction in the amount of drugs that are being seized coming from China. It\u2019s easy to focus on pounds. It\u2019s easy to talk about the number of incidents. We have to remember we\u2019re talking about our people\u2019s lives.\u201dSen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), one of the co-sponsors of the Fentanyl Sanctions Act, called China \u201cthe world\u2019s largest drug dealer\u201d back in April 2019. Carroll said that the Chinese government expressed dismay when he travelled to the country and said \u201cif they don\u2019t stop, China was becoming the drug dealer of the world.\u201dAn officer from the US Customs and Border Protection, Trade and Cargo Division finds Oxycodon pills in a parcel. (Photo by JOHANNES EISELE/AFP via Getty Images)\u201cThe first meeting we had, which was in the airport, didn\u2019t even make it to the hotel,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cThey said that they knew I had made that statement publicly and they disagreed with it. They wanted to show how they are taking steps not to do it. Like I said, I think the Chinese heard us loud and clear. That certainly was their future. That was the direction they were heading. But I do believe on this issue China has realized the importance of coming to the table.\u201dCounterpoint: \u2018Very little effect on the flow of drugs\u2019Jack Riley, a 32-year veteran of the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), previously told Yahoo Finance that border barriers would only have some effect on illegal immigration.\u201cIt\u2019s going to have very little effect on the flow of drugs,\u201d Riley said, adding: \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t make business sense for cartels to move high volume amount of drugs through desolate, isolated, unwell areas \u2014 it just doesn\u2019t \u2014 when they can use ports of entry with sophisticated traps and all types of vehicles, where literally thousands of people in vehicles go back and forth every day. Right now, we\u2019re probably searching and X-raying maybe 20% of the vehicle traffic coming across.\u201dHe noted that Mexican drug lord \u201cEl Chapo\u201d mostly smuggled drugs into the U.S. through legal points of entry.An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents check pedestrians' documentation at the San Ysidro Port of Entry on October 2, 2019 in San Ysidro, California. (Photo by SANDY HUFFAKER/AFP via Getty Images)\u201cIf you\u2019re sitting on a mountain in Sinaloa as Chapo did, he would say \u2018Today I\u2019m going to shotgun 10 vehicles with 10 kilos each across the border. I got about a 60% to 70% chance of getting that much through,\u2019\u2019 Riley said. \u201cYou only got to bat .300 to get in the Baseball Hall of Fame. It\u2019s a good business move.\u201dSheila Vakharia, the deputy director of the Department of Research and Academic Engagement at Drug Policy Alliance, echoed a similar sentiment, stressing that \u201cthere\u2019s only so much a wall can do\u201d to stop the flow of drugs.\u201cWhat we know is that most drugs come into the country through legal ports of entry, and there\u2019s very little evidence that it\u2019s just the wall that could obstruct it,\u201d Vakharia told Yahoo Finance. \u201cBut the other thing is that it doesn\u2019t take a lot of fentanyl to have the intended effect. And so, a little bit of fentanyl could go a long way. A border wall isn\u2019t going to stop a small brick of fentanyl crossing the border, even if it comes over that border.\u201dA Border patrol unit (behind the fence) and a Mexico's federal police guard near the US-Mexico border fence (Photo: GUILLERMO ARIAS/AFP via Getty Images)Vakharia argued that the focus should shift towards harm reduction, since there wouldn\u2019t be as many drugs coming in if there wasn\u2019t such a demand for it.\u201cInstead of focusing on harsher penalties, we need to focus on how to keep people alive and getting people access to naloxone, getting them on treatments like methadone and buprenorphine, getting them into treatment, and having safer consumption sites,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are the kinds of things that are actually going to reduce our overdose deaths, and that\u2019s what we should be focusing on \u2014 the death.\u201dCorrection: An earlier version of this article stated that President Trump said a full border wall would cost \"maybe $10 or $12 million\" when he actually said \"maybe $10 or $12 billion.\" We regret the error.Adriana is a reporter and editor for Yahoo Finance.
