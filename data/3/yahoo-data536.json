The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow (^DJI) were on track to post gains of less than 1% for June, while the Nasdaq (^IXIC) was pacing for a monthly advance of more than 4%.\u201cOne thing we have to keep in mind and be vigilant about is risk versus reward,\u201d Peter Cecchini, the founder of AlphaOmega Advisors, told Yahoo Finance.He pointed to stretched valuations of indices, some of which are trading at \u201cnosebleed multiples,\u201d and have rallied strongly since hitting a multi-year bottom in March.\u201cThe S&P, for example, it\u2019s trading around 25-times forward earnings, forward 2020,\u201d and the broader Russell 2000 (RUT) index also looks rich, Ceccini said.\u201cAnd, so, really, the only way one can justify from a valuation standpoint buying equities at those levels is to believe 2020 earnings are going to experience a V-shaped recovery,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd, I think, frankly, that\u2019s far from certain.\u201dThe S&P is on track for its best quarter since 1998, leading up to the dot-com bubble crash. With the quarter ending on Tuesday, the index has now gained more than 18% in the last three months.Cecchini is of the view that the rally has been largely retail-driven, with newbies opening up new brokerage accounts and likely possibly putting government stimulus checks into the market.In his first \u201cCheck In with Cecchini\u201d note on June 12, the strategist declared \u201cThe Portnoy Top.\u201d That was a reference to Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy, who\u2019s taken up day trading and posted viral videos \u2014 including one where he called legendary investor Warren Buffett \u201cwashed up.\u201d\u201cI think the flows and the data show quite clearly, there is a sort of new cadre of traders in the retail space that are very important to the way markets are behaving now, perhaps in a way they haven\u2019t been just prior to the off the top in 2000,\u201d Cecchini said.Story continuesCecchini is of the belief that the market\u2019s recovery is actually a bear market bounce, and it\u2019s a \u201cwait-and-see\u201d moment for investors.\u201cRisk-reward is unfavorable to equity investors here. The next shoe to drop, frankly, is that defaults are going continue to increase, especially in High Yield and speculative-grade loan markets,\u201d Cecchini added, predicting that corporate rate defaults could increase \u201cperhaps up to 10%.\u201d\u201cI think the high yield market will trade lower, meaning spreads will go wider. It think there is more pain yet to be felt by high yield companies,\u201d he said.\u201cI think that eventually bleeds back into the real economy through slower corporate profits and through payroll reductions,\u201d the investor added.Julia La Roche is a Correspondent for Yahoo Finance.
