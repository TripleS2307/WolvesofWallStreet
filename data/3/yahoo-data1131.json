But despite the Blue Ivy Carter cameos and hit song \u2018Brown Skin Girl\u2019 (which won a BET award), users seemed to favor \u2018Hamilton\u2019 over the newly released film.According to exclusive data provided by analytics platform 7Park, the top Disney+ titles between August 1 and August 3 included \u201cIncredibles 2,\u201d \u201cFrozen 2,\u201d \u201cMuppets Now,\u201d and \u201cHamilton\u201d \u2014 with \u201cBlack Is King\u201d finishing the weekend at number 10, attracting less than 4% of total Disney+ users.(Source: 7Park Data)Meanwhile, \u201cHamilton\u201d \u2014 which made its debut on July 3 \u2014 continues to dominate.On average time spent on the Disney+ platform, users dedicated 22% of their time watching \u201cHamilton,\u201d compared to only 2.2% for \u2018Black Is King\u2019The success of \u201cHamilton\u201d has prompted Disney to look at other musicals that could potentially be adapted for the platform.\u201cOnce On This Island\u201d is one show that is reportedly being pursued \u2014 although others could easily follow suit as Broadway\u2019s coronavirus shutdown remains in effect through 2021.Live-action \u2018Mulan\u2019 film heads to Disney+(Source: 7Park)Disney+ is expected to receive a sizable boost from its live-action \u201cMulan\u201d film. On its second quarter earnings call, the company announced that the movie will now bypass the theatrical experience entirely and head straight to the streamer as a premium video on demand (PVOD). The offering will cost Disney + subscribers $30, and will be available on September 4th.Disney\u2019s stock surged on the news \u2014 rising over 8% at Wednesday\u2019s close.It\u2019s a somewhat surprising move for the company, which had been holding out hope for a theatrical release since April.However, if successful, the PVOD option is one that could permanently alter Disney\u2019s strategy when it comes to future film releases. The company would retain 100% of the profits, as opposed to the 60/40 split that typically occurs when a studio film is released in the theater.Investor sentiment was further buoyed by the company\u2019s announcement that it now has 100 million paid subscribers across its various streaming channels \u2014 with the bulk of its subscriber base stemming from Disney+.Story continuesAs of the end of the third quarter on June 27, Disney+ subscribers rose to 57.5 million \u2014 an impressive feat in an already crowded streaming landscape.But the positive streaming news could mean more problems for smaller theater chains.The \u201cMulan\u201d announcement follows NBCUniversal (CMCSA) and AMC\u2019s (AMC) newly inked deal, which will allow the studio\u2019s films to be made available as a PVOD option after just 17 days in the theater, including three weekends.MoffettNathanson\u2019s Michael Nathanson said in a recent note that \u201cPVOD will likely dampen movie attendance.\u201dHe explained: \u201cIf consumers are trained to wait only a few weeks to watch the movie at home, especially while increased COVID-19 risks still exist, we worry that the near-term impact on attendance can be more substantial and consumers in the long run will continue to opt to watch more non-blockbuster films in their homes going forward.\u201dWith theaters already under pressure from the coronavirus, \u201cthe number of screens in the U.S. [will] start to shrink as owners refocus on protecting their most profitable multiplex locations, which will hurt the overall exhibition industry,\u201d Nathanson added.Alexandra is a Producer & Entertainment Correspondent at Yahoo Finance.
