Clever used the midpoint between the maximum and minimum unemployment insurance benefits in each state to calculate income, which ranged from $30 a week in Mississippi to $1,234 a week in Massachusetts.\u201cThe biggest thing right now is that there\u2019s so many restrictions in place. A lot more people are furloughed or unemployed because of that,\u201d said Francesca Ortegren, a data scientist at Clever. \u201cWho knows how long this is going to last\u2026 living on unemployment insurance for more than a couple months is really difficult as people start to use up their savings.\u201dAnd in many cities, renters had little left over from unemployment insurance to pay for food, medical bills and other necessary expenses. In Jacksonville, Fla., renters had less than $1.42 left over after paying rent on a studio apartment, according to Clever\u2019s data.\u201cThe biggest thing right now is that there\u2019s so many restrictions in place. A lot more people are furloughed or unemployed because of that,\u201d said Francesca Ortegren, a data scientist at Clever.Some 20% of Americans said that they relied on unemployment insurance to pay necessary expenses in July. But even more used credit cards, borrowed from friends and family, or used the $1,200 stimulus check from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act to bridge the gap between their expenses and their income, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\u201cRenters who lost their jobs are in a particularly bad spot,\u201d said Ortegran, \u201cand 25% of renters are using some form of unemployment to pay for their necessities. That\u2019s a huge portion, and even more of those are worried about upcoming rent payments.\u201dUntil July 31, unemployed Americans received an extra $600 a week in unemployment insurance due to the CARES Act, which also placed restrictions on evictions. President Trump signed an executive order on August 8 adding $300-400 a week to unemployment benefits, but so far only Montana, Kentucky and West Virginia confirmed to be distributing that money.Story continues\u201cPeople were able to cover their expenses with the extra $600. It helped all but two of the metros [San Jose and San Francisco]. With the extra $400, it doesn\u2019t cover living costs in quite as many places, but it\u2019s still helpful,\u201d said Ortegren.Where unemployment benefits can cover rentThe best place for renters to live off of unemployment insurance is in Buffalo, N.Y., where studio apartment renters have $702.85 left over after paying rent, and two-bedroom apartment renters have $461 left over after paying rent, Clever found.In the most expensive metro areas \u2014 mostly in California and Florida \u2014 thousands of dollars spanned the gap between rent and unemployment insurance. San Francisco is the most burdened metro in the country for unemployed residents, with $1,000 in studio rent and $2,430 in 2-bedroom rent that isn\u2019t covered by unemployment insurance.\u201cCalifornia\u2019s unemployment insurance [midpoint $1,061.67 monthly] is in the middle range, but it is probably the most expensive state to live in, so unemployment insurance isn\u2019t matching the cost of living,\u201d said Ortegren.Surprisingly, the South is also a difficult place for unemployed residents. In Nashville, Tenn., unemployment is $660 a month, leaving studio apartment renters $150 in the hole on their monthly rent payments. And in Durham, N.C., where unemployment insurance is about $790.83 a month, studio apartment renters are $30 shy of their monthly rent payments.\u201cUnemployment insurance in the South is on the low end. In many Southern states, unemployed residents can\u2019t pay for the cost of living, which is shocking because living costs there are particularly low.\u201dSarah Paynter is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
