Only 1.34% of hotel CMBS loans were in default in July 2019, according to Trepp, a New York City-based data, analytics and technology company.\u201cIf hotels don't get more help, we will start to see a lot more defaults,\u201d said Brian Mahany, a Texas-based attorney specializing in CMBS loans. \u201cHospitality won\u2019t get back to where it was for a couple of years, so unless there is some relief, a lot will go under.\u201dThe hotel industry has been hard-hit during the coronavirus pandemic, losing over $46 billion in revenue per room since mid-February. The industry has been hit harder than the retail industry, where only 16.1% of CMBS loans were more than 30 days late in July. Hilton\u2019s (HLT) revenue per room dropped 81% in the second quarter, Marriott\u2019s (MAR) dropped 84% and Hyatt (H) dropped 89%.Previously, hotels\u2019 highest delinquency rate was during the Great Recession at about half the rate seen this year, with only $13.5 billion in delinquent loans, according to Trepp.\u201cIf hotels don't get more help, we will start to see a lot more defaults,\u201d said Brian Mahany.\u201cThe industry is in a lot of trouble. When you look at the delinquency numbers, it\u2019s the highest to date in history, outpacing 2008,\u201d said Michael Buono, principal and CEO of New York Renaissance Group and Mulberry Development, which develops well known hotels in New York City such as the NoMad Hotel. \u201cAnd it\u2019s just the beginning. We\u2019ll see things fully start to manifest\u201d \u2014 meaning that hotels will go under or pull through \u2014 by the first and second quarter of 2021,\u201d he said.The largest chunk of delinquencies come from the New York City metro area, with a 38.72% delinquency rate for a total of $1.475 billion in late loans. The Chicago metro area was the next hardest hit, with 53.84% delinquency and a balance of $976.3 million. Houston and Los Angeles also each owed more than $500 million in delinquent loans, according to Trepp.Story continuesNew York is \u201ca city dependent on a huge influx of travel, which you don\u2019t see now,\u201d said Buono. Plus, \u201cit\u2019s incredibly expensive to own in New York. So we come up with all these creative ways to make these deals work through long-term land leases and buying air rights. Now, hotels are suddenly not allowed to have people in this incredibly valuable space.\u201dThese CMBS loans are particularly tricky when they go into default because most are packaged with hundreds of other loans and underwritten into a trust, said Mahany.\u201cIf you\u2019re in default on a CMBS loan, hotel owners are starting to realize, there is no one you can deal with. There is no office, no employees \u2014 the business exists on paper only,\u201d said Mahany. \u201cThe decision maker is a special servicer who has an incentive to keep you under water for the longest possible\u201d because they only get paid for their administrative, decision-making services when a loan is in default, he said.Sarah Paynter is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
