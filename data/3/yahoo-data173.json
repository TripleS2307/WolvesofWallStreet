The state relies heavily on tourism, an industry that\u2019s been devastated by the pandemic due to travel restrictions put in place across the world.Rhode Island and Michigan followed at 55% and 46% respectively. Michigan was among the states that was hit by the virus early on and had to implement stay-at-home orders before most other states because of the high case count. Nevada, at 34%, is another state that relies heavily on tourism and hospitality, mainly because of its major city, Las Vegas.A woman wearing a facemask enters a building where the Employment Development Department has its offices in Los Angeles, California on May 4, 2020.

(Photo by OLIVIER DOULIERY/AFP via Getty Images)However, in March, the Trump administration decided against creating a nationwide SEP, instead promising a \u201ccash payment\u201d to hospitals that treated uninsured patients for coronavirus. But this doesn\u2019t extend to individuals who need health care for other issues and don\u2019t have the insurance to cover it.For people in those states that don\u2019t have an SEP, their other options include seeing if they\u2019re eligible for Medicaid (if their income is low enough) or signing up for COBRA, which means the individual continues the same health care coverage they had under their employer-based health insurance.Read more: COBRA insurance: How to file if you lose your jobHowever, COBRA has higher premium payments since there is no longer an employer contribution.Adriana is a reporter and editor covering politics and health care policy for Yahoo Finance.
