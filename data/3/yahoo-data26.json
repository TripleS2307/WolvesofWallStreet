Bytedance founder and CEO Zhang Yiming, in perhaps the most unenviable position, must convince Beijing to allow his company to hand over the reins of its U.S. operations and 100 million monthly active users to an American company.\u201cWhat it comes down to, is can the founder of Bytedance persuade the government in China to let this deal go forward,\u201d said James Lewis, senior vice president and director of the technology policy program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cMicrosoft and Walmart will have to go and placate the Chinese government. Walmart is a huge customer for Chinese goods; Microsoft has a huge presence in China.\u201dPresident Trump has threatened to shut down TikTok in the U.S. if Bytedance does not find an American suitor for its operations by September 15th. A joint bid from Microsoft-Walmart bid and one from Oracle (ORCL) are reportedly frontliners in ongoing negotiations with the Chinese company.But the dealmaking has been complicated by a last minute maneuver from Beijing, which expanded its restricted export list last Friday. In its first major overhaul since 2008, the list specifies nearly 2 dozen technologies ,including artificial intelligence and \u201cpersonalized content recommendation\u201d tools, putting the transfer of TikTok\u2019s core technology in doubt.\u201cThe Chinese Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of Science and Technology are giving themselves a tool to formally intervene in the forced sale of TikTok,\u201d said Nina Palmer, a senior director in the China practice at Albright Stonebridge Group. \u201cIt's hard to tell based on the powers that the Chinese government gave itself, if it's intending to have a final say on the actual sale or if it's attempting to block the sale altogether.\u201dStory continuesPalmer says updated export controls elevate the risk of a protracted fight over one of TikTok\u2019s fastest growing markets. The restriction requires Chinese firms to apply for a local permit before starting negotiations with foreign companies to transfer its technology. Companies are then required to obtain an export license once the transfer agreement is signed. The Commerce Ministry has said any approval would require 45 working days, putting the timeline for approval right up against the November 12th deadline specified in a separate Executive Order.\u201cIt's also very possible the Chinese government doesn't meet its own deadlines. That has happened frequently with previous deals that we've seen in the past, like the anti-monopoly law,\u201d said Palmer, singling out Qualcomm\u2019s (QCOM) failed bid to buy NXP Semiconductors (NXPI).The world\u2019s largest smartphone chip maker walked away from its $44 bid for Netherlands-based NXP in 2018, after China\u2019s antitrust regulator refused to sign off on the deal, in the face of heightened trade tensions.HANGZHOU, CHINA - MARCH 31: ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming is seen on March 31, 2016 in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province of China. (Photo by VCG/VCG via Getty Images)Bytedance has said it will comply with the new government order, though there are still questions about what that order would entail, and what technology Beijing would allow to be transferred. With talks reportedly hitting a snag over whether the app\u2019s core algorithm, which determines the videos users see, will be included as part of the deal, TikTok\u2019s roughly $30 billion price tag could be in jeopardy.\u201cGenerally when you buy a company, all the engineers, all the technology goes with the deal,\u201d said Alfred Chuang, general partner of Race Capital, in a recent interview with CNBC, in which he called TikTok\u2019s \u201c15 million lines of machine learning code\u201d its crown jewel. \u201cHow will they cut and convert that and how much of that will actually be transferred over? I feel like we now have a big dance here.\u201dBut Howard Yu, LEGO professor of management and innovation at IMD Business School says the platform is still an attractive buy even without the algorithm in place, particularly for Walmart and its efforts to attract a younger customer base.\u201cIt\u2019s not really about the algorithm ... The remaining value of TikTok is all the influencers between the 16- to 25-year-old group. So whoever is getting it, whether it\u2019s [Microsoft-Walmart] or Oracle, is really galvanizing the audience,\u201d he said.Beyond TikTok, China\u2019s new restrictions and the Trump administration\u2019s heavy involvement in corporate dealmaking are likely to have lasting implications for how American and Chinese companies approach their investments moving forward, Palmer said.\u201cI do think it sets a precedent, or rhetorical precedent for the Chinese to do something similar to U.S. companies,\u201d Palmer said. \u201cThe export control catalog update demonstrates the Chinese government will use export controls in the U.S., China relationship free fall. Companies that are creating or storing any type of intellectual property or exporting technology from China as a manufactured good need to relook at their risk assessments on China.\u201dAkiko Fujita is an anchor and reporter for Yahoo Finance.
