It reported net revenues of 30,226 billion yen, or roughly $281.20 billion, during that time.Tesla, in comparison, ended 2019 with $24.6 billion in revenues, having delivered 367,200 vehicles last year. Chief Executive Elon Musk in the past said Tesla would deliver at least 500,000 vehicles in 2020, a forecast the company has not changed despite the coronavirus pandemic.Tesla is expected to report second-quarter delivery numbers this week.(Reporting by Tina Bellon; Editing by David Gregorio)"}]}
