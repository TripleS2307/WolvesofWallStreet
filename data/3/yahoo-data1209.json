We believe that he would be very seriously entertaining our proposal.\u201dStory continuesWarren added: \u201cDemocrats are ready to act in 2021.\u201d(Graphic: David Foster)More than 100 organizations from civil rights groups to consumer advocacy groups have advocated debt cancellation.\u201cWe join Senators Schumer and Warren in calling on President Trump to immediately cancel up to $50,000 in federal student loan debt for 43 million borrowers,\u201d Persis Yu, National Consumer Law Center attorney and director of NCLC\u2019s Student Borrower Assistance Project, said in a statement.Yu added that debt cancellation is \u201curgently needed now as American families are struggling to stay financially afloat\u201d and the \u201cgovernment cannot afford to wait any longer.\u201dThe resolution highlighted how borrowers of color are facing one of the \u201cworst effects\u201d of student loan debt \u2014 from Black and Latinx borrowers accruing more debt than their white peers to defaulting at higher rates \u2014 and argued that cancellation helps \u201cclose racial wealth gaps.\u201dVarious cancellation proposalsThe Trump administration previously extended the interest-free payment pause for federal student loan borrowers to December 31, 2020.The cancellation of up to $50,000 in federally-held student debt comes after House Democrats unveiled a bill proposing $30,000 in debt cancellation and then a $10,000 cancellation proposal. Senate Democrats also echoed the call for $10,000 cancellation, and Biden has also called for $10,000 in student loan debt cancellation.Democratic presidential nominee and former Vice President Joe Biden waves as he leaves the Hotel Dupont after having internal campaign meetings on September 16, 2020 in Wilmington, Delaware.

Other groups have disagreed with that idea, arguing cancellation benefits mostly those who have the ability to repay.Student loan expert Mark Kantrowitz, publisher and VP of research at Savingforcollege.com, noted that $10,000 may be a more realistic goal because ultimately, \u201cforgiveness is unlikely to happen, but if it does, the most likely amount is $10,000 because the cost is low compared to the number of borrowers.\u201d\u2014Aarthi is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.
