However, those costs as well as the expenditure to keep stores operating safely have pressured its profit margins.The company said full-time hourly employees will get a $300 bonus, while part-time and temporary employees will get $150, adding that drivers, managers and assistant managers will also receive a bonus.The world's largest retailer also said it would close its own and Sam's Club outlets on Thanksgiving day this year.(Reporting by Uday Sampath in Bengaluru; Editing by Amy Caren Daniel)"}]}
