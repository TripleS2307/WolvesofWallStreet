Although Democrats and Republicans pledged to keep talking, the jobless provision lapsed on Friday \u2014 which could spell financial ruin for approximately 30 million Americans drawing an extra $600-a-week unemployment benefit provided by the CARES Act.Roubini, dubbed \u201cDr. Doom\u201d for his famously dark warnings about the economy and having predicted the 2008 meltdown, told Yahoo Finance in an interview that foot-dragging in Washington could lead to another recession, at a time when concerns about the recovery are already festering.\u201cUnless the government does its own part to save and boost the income of the private sector, there will be a sharp slowdown,\u201d said the chairman and CEO of Roubini Macro Associates, who is also an economics professor at NYU.Referencing the shape of an economic rebound, Roubini said a rapid \u201cV-shaped\u201d recovery from the steep plunge during the first half \u201ccould become a \u2018U,\u2019 the \u2018U\u2019 could become a double-dip recession, and over the medium term, there are even forces could that could lead to a Greater Depression,\u201d he said.\u201cSo, we are playing with fire by not reaching an agreement,\u201d the economist added.\u201cThe fact there is now this gridlock in Congress, and in Washington, doesn\u2019t bode well at a time when economic activity looks like it\u2019s stalling,\u201d Roubini said \u2014 pointing to increasing uncertainty amongst businesses and consumers as coronavirus cases jump, particularly in the Sun Belt.According to Roubini, the U.S. still needs a \u201csignificant fiscal stimulus\u201d of \u201cat least $1.5 trillion for the next few months,\u201d or the economy will slow down further.The Federal Reserve and the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) have bolstered the economy, but Roubini said more is needed.Story continues\u201cThe income of people is still constrained by the fact that economic activity is slow, unemployment is very high. The Fed is doing its own share, but more than monetary policy, what matters right now for people is having income in their paychecks,\u201d Roubini said.He added the boost to paychecks could come in the form of unemployment benefits, more PPP loans, aid for state and local governments, food stamps, support for healthcare, etc.\u201cWe still need a significant boost from the public sector because the private sector is deleveraging. Households and corporates are spending less, are saving more, doing less capital spending, less investment in residential,\u201d the economist added.Julia La Roche is a Correspondent for Yahoo Finance.
