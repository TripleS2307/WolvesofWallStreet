Bernie Sanders.Then 110-page document \u2014 which involved six joint task forces \u2014 runs the gamut on issues as varied as climate change, raising the minimum wage, and student loan debt.On student debt, the Biden-Sanders team met in the middle on the idea of debt cancellation. (During his campaign, Sanders proposed to eliminate all student debt).\u201cRoughly six in 10 jobs require at least some education beyond high school, and yet the ever-rising cost of college tuition and fees leaves higher education out of reach\u2014or saddles students with a lifetime of debt,\u201d the document stated.Democratic U.S. presidential candidates former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders do an elbow bump in place in Washington, U.S. March 15, 2020.

Those earning more than $25,000 would have their payments capped at no more than 5% of their discretionary income. After 20 years, their remaining debt would be \u201cautomatically forgiven.\u201dBankruptcy: The proposal lays out a plan that would rejuvenate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to \u201ctake action against exploitative lenders and will work with Congress to allow student debt to be discharged during bankruptcy.\u201d The current process is complicated, burdensome, and quite difficult, as lawyer Austin Smith has explained in a previous interview to Yahoo Finance.Public service loan forgiveness: The task force recommends reforming this program, which has been criticized for its shortcomings \u2014 including a 99% rejection rate at one point \u2014 to make enrollment \u201cautomatic\u201d for those who qualify, such as teachers, and those working in government agencies and non-profit organizations.PSLF forgiveness: They also propose to \u201cmake the program more generous\u201d by offering a tiered cancellation totaling $50,000 for public service workers: Forgiving up to $10,000 in student debt per year for up to 5 years. (This is similar to a bill Democratic senators have introduced.)Forgiveness for teachers: Educators in particular will get up to $50,000 of their student debt forgiven.For-profit colleges: Under these proposals, for-profit colleges would face a more restrictive enviroment: \u201cThe Trump Administration has let for-profit colleges and universities once again prey upon students with impunity by repealing important protections.\u201d It proposes to tighten requirements on how for-profit colleges \u201cdemonstrate their value and effectiveness before becoming eligible for federal student loans.\u201d The new Secretary of Education to re-instate borrower defense, and forgive loans held by defrauded students who attended predatory for-profit colleges. It will also protect veterans and service members from ending up in bad programs.Democratic presidential candidate and former US Vice President Joe Biden at the Delaware Memorial Bridge Veteran's Memorial Park in New Castle, Delaware, May 25, 2020.
