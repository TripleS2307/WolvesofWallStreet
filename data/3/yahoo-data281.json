From what I\u2019m seeing right now, I think that unfortunately there\u2019s going to be a lot of death coming.\u201dWith the relaxing of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) restrictions, visitors crowd the boardwalk on Memorial Day weekend in Ocean City, Maryland, U.S., May 23, 2020.

And on Friday, the U.S. reported over 40,000 infections, the highest number of new cases in a day.Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), spoke of the troubling trend during a Senate committee hearing on Tuesday, stating: \u201cI would not be surprised if we go up to 100,000 [new cases] a day if this does not turn around.\u201dCoronavirus cases are increasing in the Sun Belt region. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)\u2018It never really went away for us\u2019While some countries that were once major coronavirus hot spots have since been able to begin to flatten the curve, the U.S. has been unable to do so.The U.S. is still the global leader in the number of coronavirus cases and deaths. Part of it is attributed to the fact that many states reopened their economies and lifted stay-at-home restrictions too quickly.\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing right now is an enormous number of it coming back,\u201d Ellice said. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see people coming in again with what we know to be the beginnings of another big surge.\u201dCoronavirus cases are surging in many parts of the world. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)California, where Dr. Ellice is based, is one of the states seeing a significant increase in the number of cases.\u201cIt never really went away for us in Los Angeles County,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had been a hot spot throughout but I think the rest of the state had maybe started to think that the worst was behind them, but starting about a week ago, we began to see some cases trickling in and then it started to look more and more like the early days of March.\u201dStory continuesMany of these spikes are being attributed to Memorial Day weekend activities, during which crowds assembled throughout that weekend.COCOA BEACH, FL - MAY 23: Cocoa Beach was crowded on Memorial Day weekend.. (Photo by Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post via Getty Images)As a result, some hospitals across the country are on the verge of reaching capacity in terms of available beds, especially in their ICUs, along with a shortage of ventilators. At Ellice\u2019s hospital, there are enough ventilators for now but still a lot of worry.\u201cIn Los Angeles and in California, there\u2019s some concern about one of our counties \u2014 Imperial County \u2014 being overwhelmed,\u201d Ellice said. \u201cOur hospital system that I work in, we\u2019ve been able in the past to move patients around in order to accommodate as we had surges in different areas. What\u2019s a little bit concerning right now for the entire state and for the entire country is that with the recent openings and elective surgeries going on, this is going to be a little bit more of a challenge than perhaps the beginning of the first wave in March.\u201dThe vaccine realitySome states are in more trouble than othhers.Florida is reporting its highest daily case count ever, while Houston is quickly running out of beds. Although many of these places had begun resuming elective surgeries, Ellice said those will likely be under review again, particularly since the hospitals can move patients around.\u201cICU beds can be extended,\u201d she said. \u201cVentilators can be extended and moved around from place to place. But staffing is difficult and especially as some of us become ill from treating these patients, it becomes a challenge in the sense that if we\u2019re continuing to operate as normal and doing elective procedures, then there are going to be fewer and fewer resources available to treat these patients. So I anticipate that will probably be re-examined going forward.\u201dRadiation therapists Jessica Penney, left, and Jennifer Campbell, right, prepare cancer patient Kenton Fabrick for his treatment in the Radiation Oncology Department at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, MA on on June 10, 2020.

Even if we had a vaccine right now, ramping up production and distribution would be formidable. I\u2019ve seen a lot of folks say we\u2019re going to have a vaccine next year, and I think that\u2019s very optimistic.\u201dAdriana is a reporter and editor covering politics and health care policy for Yahoo Finance.
