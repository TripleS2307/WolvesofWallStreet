The Department of Education, Secretary DeVos didn't follow the rules in trying to promulgate this new rule \u2014 they didn't follow the administrative procedures act requirements.\u201dThe lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, argues that the Education Department (ED)\u2019s decision to repeal the Obama-era regulations \u201cviolates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)\u201d and also asked the court to \u201crequire ED to reimplement the Obama-era processes and protections.\u201dBecerra added that the ED actions under DeVos \u201care arbitrary and capricious \u2026 they rigged the system against students, flat and simple \u2014 they rigged the system.\u201dThe Department of Education provided the following comment: \u201cThis is yet another grandstanding, politically driven lawsuit meant to grab a cheap headline, and the media seems to always oblige. To any objective observer, our borrower defense rule clearly protects students from fraud, ensures they are entitled to financial relief if they suffered harm and holds schools accountable.\u201dU.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos speaks during a White House Coronavirus Task Force press briefing at the U.S. Department of Education July 8, 2020. (PHOTO: Alex Wong/Getty Images)History of borrower defenseUnder existing law, borrowers with federal loans are eligible for loan forgiveness if a college or a university has misled them or engaged in other misconduct in violation of certain state laws.In 2015, after several for-profit colleges went extinct amid scandals, the Obama administration implemented regulations such that defrauded students who made a successful claim would be granted full debt relief.Becerra had previously sued DeVos in December 2017, pushing DeVos to grant promised loan relief to students who attended the now-defunct Corinthian Colleges.Story continuesDeVos modified the Obama-era rule in 2019, making it tougher to access relief and alleging that the Obama administration \u201cweaponized\u201d the policy.\u201cWhen borrower defense arrived in 1995, it ... was little used\u2026 in the 20 years from 1995 to 2015, fewer than 60 claims were filed,\u201d she said during a previous hearing in front of the House Committee on Education and Labor. \u201cThen the previous administration weaponized the regulation against schools it simply didn\u2019t like. They applied the law in a discriminatory fashion. So since 2015, there has been a 5,000% increase in borrower defense claims.\u201dU.S. President Donald Trump sas Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos and Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue look on during a briefing on the coronavirus pandemic in the press briefing room of the White House on March 27, 2020 in Washington, DC.

Congress tried to stop the change but that effort failed after President Trump vetoed the reversal on June 28 and the resulting Congressional vote failed to overrule the veto.The new lawsuit argues that the new rule is not only \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d but also doesn\u2019t \u201ccomply with Congress\u2019s requirement that the Secretary implement a meaningful process for borrowers to obtain relief.\u201dThe attorneys general also cited a document published by ED in the federal register in September 2019 that showed how exactly the DeVos policy tightens debt relief: For every 100 students who applied for debt relief through this program for their loans, only four qualified.Comparing the Obama rule (Nov. 2016) to the DeVos (Feb. 2018) rule, looking at the percentage of loan volume that\u2019s associated with \u201capproved defense to repayment applications,\u201d it was 42.4% to 4.95%.This isn\u2019t the first lawsuit against DeVos on borrower defense. The most recent one targets the \u201cPartial Relief Rule,\u201d a rule implemented by ED in December 2019.\u2014Aarthi is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering consumer finance and education.
