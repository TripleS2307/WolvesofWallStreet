Some 54.5% of low-income Americans have paid off their homes, outpacing the national average by 16.5 percentage points, although they are less likely to own a home overall, according to the study. Meanwhile, homeowners with a six-figure salary tend to face higher mortgage payments relative to their income.\u201cSan Francisco may pay higher salaries, but home prices are more expensive relative to those incomes, so a mortgage is harder to pay off,\u201d said Fretwell. \u201cPlus, banks are more likely to give big loans to applicants with higher income levels. So the more debt you can take on, the harder it is to pay off a mortgage.\u201dHomeowners with mortgages have higher household incomes but also higher housing costs. Graphic by Construction Coverage based on Census data.Local housing costs make a differenceFamilies are considered \u201cburdened\u201d by housing costs when they exceed a third of a family\u2019s income. In areas where more mortgages are paid off, housing costs represented a smaller portion of households\u2019 average incomes.Small- and mid-sized metro areas outperformed the average. In mid-sized metro areas with under 350,000 residents, like Odessa, Texas and Charleston, West Virginia, 49.2% and 47.5% of homes are paid off, respectively. Housing costs represented only 16% of income in each city, about half of the threshold to be considered burdened by housing costs.Story continuesAnd mid-sized metro areas with fewer than 1 million residents, like McAllen, Texas and Brownsville, Texas, had 49.6% and 47.9% of homes paid off, respectively. Housing costs were only about 20% for each metro.But in large metros with over 1 million residents, fewer homeowners have paid off their home. New Orleans, Detroit, Houston and San Antonio are the only large cities with at least 30% of owner-occupied homes paid off \u2014 still falling short of the national average by as many as 8 percentage points. These major cities rose to the top because housing costs were only 20% of average income (except Detroit where housing costs are only 17.7%).\u201cHome prices [and thus, mortgage payments] are lower in areas with mortgage-free homeownership. That\u2019s the strongest indicator,\u201d said Fretwell.Sarah Paynter is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
