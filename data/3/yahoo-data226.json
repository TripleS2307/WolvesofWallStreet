That\u2019s going to be a beautiful day, but we\u2019re not there yet. But that\u2019s going to be a beautiful day.\u201dJuneteenth is the oldest nationally celebrated commemoration of slavery coming to an end in the U.S. It dates back to 1865 \u2014 on June 19 the Union soldiers went to Galveston, TX. with news the Civil War ended and that slaves were free.Story continuesThe day takes on even more meaning this year as protests have erupted worldwide over racial injustice, sparked by the deaths of Floyd and Brooks.Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos has encouraged all his employees to cancel meetings (as he will be doing) to observe Juneteenth.
