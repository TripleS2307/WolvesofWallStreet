Ruscio/Getty Images / Netflix)Netflix has drawn attention and some criticism for what the company calls the \u201ckeeper test,\u201d which asks managers to assess direct-reports based on whether they would try to prevent them from leaving for another company. A report from the Wall Street Journal, in 2018, found that the approach contributed to anxiety among workers who fear a sudden dismissal.Story continuesHastings rejected the notion of unhappiness among Netflix employees, citing employee satisfaction surveys that rank Netflix among the top companies nationwide.\u201cNetflix employees love working there,\u201d Hastings says. \u201cIt's so fun because people feel the trust, the openness of the culture, information sharing, and because they've got incredible colleagues \u2014 and so they get to do a lot.\u201dBut the workplace culture at Netflix fits a certain type of employee, Hastings acknowledged.\u201cNetflix is not for everyone,\u201d he says. \u201cNetflix is for people who are learning machines. They just love absorbing new ideas and new experiences and are willing to make mistakes to figure things out. And it's those kind of self-motivated learners that do so well at Netflix.\u201dHastings spoke to Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer in an episode of \u201cInfluencers with Andy Serwer,\u201d a weekly interview series with leaders in business, politics, and entertainment. The complete interview will air on Sept. 10.Netflix co-founder and co-CEO Reed Hastings and co-author Erin Meyer detail the company's unorthodox management style in the new book \"No Rules Rules: Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention.\" The streaming service added nearly 26 million subscribers over the first six months of this year, bringing its total subscribers worldwide to about 193 million. By comparison, Disney Plus (DIS) had 60.5 million subscribers worldwide as of Aug. 3 \u2014 though the platform has operated for a far shorter time, having launched last November.Over the past year, Netflix has faced a slew of new competitors in streaming, including Disney Plus HBO Max (T), Peacock (CMCSA), and Apple TV (AAPL). Plus, Hulu and Amazon Prime (AMZN) remain significant challengers.Nevertheless, 41% of Netflix users plan to keep their subscriptions after the pandemic \u2014 a higher retention rate than any other service, according to a survey of 1,000 Americans released by Piper Sandler on Aug. 25.The management tactic perhaps most affiliated with Netflix is its unlimited vacation time for employees, which gives them immense flexibility but also may deter some workers from taking sufficient time off due to a lack of clarity about how much is appropriate.Hastings said the company doesn\u2019t track employee vacation time but that he models an opportunistic approach to the benefit.\u201cI try to set a great example by taking a lot of vacation,\u201d he says. \u201cI'm always talking about it.\u201d\u201cAnd some of the time you come up with your greatest ideas when you're on vacation,\u201d he adds.Read more:Netflix was 'one of my great mistakes,' says billionaire investor Mario GabelliCoronavirus vaccine 'possible' by winter: Top Harvard scientistBill Gates: We should be able to \u2018manufacture a lot of vaccines\u2019 next yearMichael Dell: \u2018Not enough\u2019 progress on diversity in the tech industryRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"}]}
