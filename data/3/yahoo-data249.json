Florida\u2019s positivity rate hit nearly 16% in a day as the state saw its biggest single-day increase in cases and hospitalizations. Meanwhile, California reported its highest daily surge of over 7,000 cases.Although questions remain about how the NY-NJ-CT rule will be enforced, similar practices were used in Rhode Island, which had the National Guard set up at the borders to screen out-of-state visitors, as well as Hawaii. Florida previously imposed a similar ban that\u2019s still in effect, which included checkpoints to screen drivers.The Lone Star State has emerged as a real source of concern. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is taking heat for his comments to keep closing down as a last option \u2014 despite the state recording a record nearly 5,500 cases in a single day Tuesday. The state, the second largest in the nation, is reaching concerning levels of the outbreak amid rising positivity and hospitalization rates.Dr. Cedric Dark, an assistant professor at Baylor College of Medicine & board member with Doctors for America, told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday that Abbott\u2019s decision to allow local leaders to implement their own masking policies may have made Texas\u2019 outbreak worse.\u201cNow there\u2019s been more clarity and changes on the state level, but I fear the horse is already out of the barn,\u201d he said.Story continuesThe U.S.\u2019s struggles have spurred countries in Europe, which have been successfully managing their spread and fully reopening, to weigh a travel ban on visitors from the world\u2019s largest economy.Patients without symptoms big COVID spreadersThere are over 2.3 million coronavirus cases in the U.S. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control released a new report on the spread of COVID-19 among college-aged travelers, and their contacts from March 26 to April 5 to Mexico from Austin, Texas.The study concluded that 28% of the travelers tested positive \u2014 and of those one-fifth were asymptomatic.\u201cAsymptomatic persons or those with mild symptoms likely play an important role in sustaining [coronavirus] transmission during outbreaks, especially in younger populations, such as the one described here,\u201d the CDC wrote.\u201cThe high prevalence of asymptomatic persons underscores the importance of testing both symptomatic and asymptomatic persons after a known COVID-19 exposure,\u201d it added.While the CDC said the study was limited in scope, and that the travelers were only tested once due to limited availability at the time, it sheds light on how higher education should proceed in the fall.\u201cAs schools and universities make decisions about reopening, it is important that they plan for isolating and testing persons with suspected COVID-19, quarantining their contacts, and implementing suggestions described in CDC\u2019s Considerations for Institutes of Higher Education,\u201d the authors added.Anjalee Khemlani is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
