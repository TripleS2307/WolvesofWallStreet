Back then the Federal Funds rate was at 2.25%\u20132.50%, and many accounts offered interest of over 2.20% APYs.The Federal Reserve began cutting rates that winter, and when the coronavirus hit, the Fed reacted in an emergency measure, slashing rates to zero. What was left of the crazy-good interest in savings accounts mostly vanished as well. The Fed this month suggested interest rates will likely stay at near-zero through the end of 2023.Today most of the key players like Ally Bank (ALLY), Goldman Sachs' (GS) Marcus, and American Express (AXP) pay 0.60% in interest.The Fed isn\u2019t the only reason why savings accounts aren\u2019t paying out as much in interest.Citibank logo seen in New York City.

Investors are hoarding trillions of dollars as people wait for the election outcome and for the stock market to retreat after missing the brief window when the market was cheaper.\u201cDeposits are the lifeblood of banks and when loan demand is high, banks need to bring in more deposits and will often pay up to do so,\u201d said McBride. \u201cWhen banks are sitting on more deposits than they can profitably lend out \u2013 like is the case for many right now \u2013 this too puts a downward influence on deposit rates.\u201dIn other words, it\u2019s not all Jay Powell\u2019s fault.The rates turmoil has also shaken up the ranking of these institutions in terms of interest rates, as banks have had different needs for deposits.Goldman Sachs' Marcus and American Express' savings accounts pay 0.6% in interest.

Similarly, both CIT and Citizens led the rankings two years ago, with Citizens\u2019 account offering a 2.25% APY. CIT has fallen to 0.55%, on the low end of its competitors, and Citizens ranks below many of the banks it used to beat. Synchrony, which often led the rankings, has fallen down the list but not as far as CIT, still offering 0.75%.Story continuesThe most generous savings now is from Citi, which pays 0.90% in interest \u2014 for now.Rates don\u2019t fall for every bank in lockstep, which is why many experts suggest shopping around or transferring cash reserves or emergency fund money to the most lucrative options.For a brief moment, online robo-advisors led online savings accounts. Wealthfront and Robinhood paid 2.24% and 2.69% APY, respectively, at their debuts, leading the market, and Robinhood paid 1.80% at its launch last year also leading the market. Now, Robinhood and Wealthfront pay 0.35% and Betterment pays 0.40% \u2013 no longer competitive.Update 9/23: Ally slashes APY to 0.60% from 0.80%.\u2014Ethan Wolff-Mann is a writer at Yahoo Finance focusing on consumer issues, personal finance, retail, airlines, and more.
