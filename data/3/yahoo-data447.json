Biden\u2019s chances are being bolstered by sizable leads in Florida and Michigan, states in which the president prevailed in 2016, and will likely need in 2020.The hydra-headed crises engulfing the administration \u2014 including social upheaval, an economy in turmoil and the still raging coronavirus outbreak \u2014 have sandbagged the president, who until recently was considered the prohibitive favorite.\"With coronavirus numbers rising in 22 states and Black Lives Matter protests across the country, Donald Trump\u2019s presidency is being severely tested,\u201d noted Smarkets Head of Political Markets Sarbjit Bakhshi.Smarkets data mirror major polls that have consolidated in Biden\u2019s favor ahead of the November vote, and other predictive sites have trended in his direction. Amidst the turmoil, Trump\u2019 approval ratings have sagged to the lowest levels of his presidency.\u201cEven though recent polling gave Biden a double-digit lead in the swing state of Florida, nothing can be taken for granted and both candidates will be looking for ways to supercharge their support before November,\u201d Bakhshi said.Moreover, Biden\u2019s coattails may be long enough to carry other Democrats to wins that may swing the Senate in his party\u2019s favor. US Bookies, another predictive betting market, found that Republicans are less likely to retain control of the upper chamber as Democratic candidates take the offensive.\u201cCurrent data suggests that the Democrats have a strong chance of winning the majority of the Senate,\u201d said US-Bookies betting industry analyst Alex Donohue.Story continues\u201cWith polls and betting odds also favoring Joe Biden in the 2020 election, we\u2019re seeing Democrats make a strong push to take the majority,\u201d he said.SMH Group CEO George Ball told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday that at this stage, markets are fairly neutral on whether Trump will return to the Oval Office in November. Investors \u201chaven\u2019t decided which way it\u2019ll go,\u201d he said.Yet neither do markets appear to be pricing in the rising prospects of a Democratic sweep that puts Biden in the White House, while leaving his party with majorities in both chambers of Congress.The challenger\u2019s tax plan will likely raise taxes but \u201cwill not be disastrous for Corporate America. The pure Biden plan is not a socialistic plan...it\u2019s very tolerable, but it will impact earnings\u201d which are \u201csomewhat stretched\u201d currently, Ball added.The wild card for the general election remains the economy\u2019s health. After employment and retail sales that posted staggering monthly gains after precipitous drops in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, Wall Street is aggressively pricing in a sharp recovery.\"Trump supporters are hoping an economic recovery will boost his chances,\u201d Smarkets\u2019 Bakhshi wrote on Wednesday. Despite the record month of retail sales, economists widely expect a deep recession this year \u2014 something no incumbent has ever been able to shake.\u201cAt the same time, Biden has everything to gain from a diverse choice of exceptionally talented vice-president candidates who will help him gain support in areas in which he is weaker,\u201d Bakhshi added \u2014 which include California Senator Kamala Harris, who\u2019s seen as the front-runner among Smarkets bettors.Javier David is an editor for Yahoo Finance.
