U.S. crude stockpiles increased by a higher-than-expected 1.4 million barrels last week, according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).\u201cWhat really scared the market with today\u2019s EIA report, is that we saw a significant rebound in crude oil production on the domestic side,\u201d said Schork.What\u2019s worse, says Schork, is that the U.S. is technically already in peak driving season.\u201cWe\u2019re only looking at maybe 8 or 9 more weeks of peak demand, and then demand starts to fall as we get into September and October,\u201d said Schork. \u201cThis summer as far as the demand story, it\u2019s over. It never began.\u201dMore people working from home and industries shifting amid the pandemic paint an uncertain scenario for the oil market.\u201cDemand in the here and the now through the remainder of this year and well into 2021, is still going to lag. It will be well more than a year before we get even back to levels, if we ever get back there,\u201d said Schork.\u201cWith 20, 25 million Americans out of work right now that translates into about 17 to 18 million commuters that no longer have jobs to drive to,\u201d said Schork. \u201cThat is demand that is lost. It\u2019s going to be a while.\u201dStorage is shown at the Marathon Petroleum Corp. refinery in Detroit, Tuesday, April 21, 2020. The world is awash in oil, there's little demand for it and we're running out of places to put it. That in a nutshell explains this week's strange and unprecedented action in the market for crude oil futures contracts, where traders essentially offered to pay someone else to deal with the oil they were due to have delivered next month.(AP Photo/Paul Sancya)\u2018Oil in this generation, it is a twilight industry\u2019The rise in electric and hybrid vehicles is also putting pressure on the oil and gasoline markets.\u201cOil in this generation, it is a twilight industry,\u201d said Schork.\u201cWe\u2019ve made too many advances on the other side to wean ourselves off gasoline,\u201d he added.\u201cPerhaps we\u2019ll never get back to those demand figures for oil and for gasoline in the United States that we enjoyed just two years ago. The tide has certainly turned in this market,\u201d said Schork.Story continuesOn Wednesday, US West Texas Intermediate crude (CL=F) settled 5.85% lower, at $38.01 a barrel. Brent crude (BZ=F) lost 5.5%, to close at $40.29 \u2014 a day after marking its highest price since early March.Industry supply cuts and optimism over demand as businesses re-open helped prices rally over the past couple of months, recovering from the massive sell-off in April when US crude futures turned negative for the first time in history.Ines covers the U.S. stock market from the floor of the New York Exchange.
