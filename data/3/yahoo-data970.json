I have talked to more institutional investors the last six months on Tesla than the last six years because the story has changed fundamentally, and profitability wise,\u201d Ives told Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade. \u201cYou need to start focusing on the market [electric vehicle] and on the indexing of the S&P 500 (^GSCP). It has changed the game a bit. Of course there is retail [investor] momentum, no doubt. I think there is a bit of a misperception that it\u2019s all retail. I believe there is a strong institutional support there because there has been a change in the fundamental story of Tesla.\u201dThe pure data on Tesla suggests Ives has a point.Tesla\u2019s stock is about 58% institutionally owned, according to Yahoo Finance Premium data. While not as high as most companies with a similarly outsized market cap ($443 billion), Tesla does have more institutional ownership than auto rival Ford (F) (55%, per Yahoo Finance Premium data).Meanwhile, Tesla\u2019s top five institutional shareholders is a who\u2019s who of credibility (according to Bloomberg data): Ballie Gifford, Capital Group, Vanguard, BlackRock and FMR. Smaller institutions such as ARK Invest Management (a mega Tesla bull), Legal & General Group and Northern Trust have all added to their Tesla holdings since June 30, according to regulatory filings.The unconvinced institutional crowd could be lured into Tesla soon. Shares of Tesla rose 8% to $479 on Monday as the stock split five-for-one, making it cheaper (though valuation/market cap remains the same) on paper to get involved with Tesla ahead of a potential addition to the S&P 500.For his part, Ives is staying bullish on Tesla even as the stock has skyrocketed this year. Ives has a bull case price target on Tesla of $700 a share.Story continues\u201cIf you miss the Tesla story, especially from an indexing perspective, you\u2019re trying to figure out what font to use on your resume,\u201d Ives remarked.Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
