Tesla shares closed Monday at $1643.\u201cWhy we\u2019ve been dragging our feet about the price target is really about the earnings power, and that at the end of the day we think is driven by the gross margins,\u201d said Rusch, who has an Outperform rating on the stock.\u201cWhat we\u2019re looking for on Wednesday evening is really progress in the Shanghai facility and demonstration that gross margins are holding up,\u201d said Rusch.The analyst says he will also be paying attention to the company\u2019s self-driving technology, and progress on its European giga-factory, and next giga factory for the Cybertruck.the company logo shones off the grille of an unsold 2020 Model S sedan at a Tesla dealership Sunday, July 19, 2020, in Littleton, Colo.

Shares of the electric vehicle maker almost touched $1800 earlier this month.\u201cIt makes sense if you believe in the disruptive nature of the technology, and the disruptive nature of the platform,\u201d said Rusch.\u201cAs we look at the market as a forward-looking entity, and I\u2019m looking out 4-5 years... Tesla can has the potential to really disrupt the market in all major segments. If we\u2019re looking at the light duty segment, as well as the heavy duty, and last-mile, middle-mile delivery space.\u201dCheaper gas prices at the pump won\u2019t sway would-be-Tesla- buyers away from purchasing an electric vehicle, said Rusch.\u201cIt\u2019s similar to going to the grocery store and buying organic, or buying things for kids with natural materials,\u201d said Rusch. \u201cWe think this is really about consumers investing in what they want to see in the world and certainly they are willing to pay a premium for it.\u201dStory continuesGet the advanced data and expert fundamental analysis you can trust with Yahoo Finance Premium.
