Reach me on Twitter at @danielhowley or email me at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.Now, on to your questions. This week's dilemma:\u2018What back-to-school tech does my kid need?\u2019We\u2019re halfway through the summer, and that means the back-to-school season is in full swing. And with many schools expected to start the school year with remote learning as a result of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, students are going to need new tech more than ever.We\u2019re talking laptops, Chromebooks, and routers to help get work done, and a few other gadgets for the inevitable down time.Here\u2019s the gear you\u2019ll want to look for while back-to-school shopping this year.LaptopsWhether your child is participating in remote learning or heading off to school, they\u2019re going to need a laptop. And if you\u2019re looking for the best of the best, my go-tos are Apple\u2019s (APPL) MacBook Air and Dell\u2019s XPS 13.Apple's MacBook Air is a fantastic laptop for students at home and on the go. (Image: Apple)Both systems can be outfitted with powerful components and plenty of storage for all of your student\u2019s homework, not to mention movies, music, and photos. Just as importantly, they\u2019re thin and light, making them perfect for sliding into a backpack or shoulder bag for whenever schools and colleges eventually reopen.Apple\u2019s entry-level MacBook Air will set you back $999 or $899 with student pricing, while Dell\u2019s entry-level XPS 13 will cost you $999.I\u2019d recommend going with slightly upgraded models of each to ensure you\u2019re getting the most bang for your buck in the long run. That means opting for the MacBook Air with a Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for $1,199 with student pricing. Dell\u2019s XPS 13 also costs $1,199 with the same kind of setup.Story continuesChromebooksIf your student doesn\u2019t need a full-fledged laptop for school or college, you can choose a Google Chromebook. Built by electronics giants ranging from HP and Samsung to Dell and Acer, Chromebooks are powered by Google\u2019s Chrome OS operating system and are built largely for lightweight apps, web browsing, and online productivity.Google's Pixelbook Go is a slick, sturdy Chromebook that's worth the price. (Image: Google)The folks at Laptopmag.com recommend the ASUS Chromebook Flip C434 as the best overall Chromebook. Starting at $561 on Amazon or $569 at Best Buy, the Flip features a 2-in-1 convertible design, meaning you can use it as both a standard notebook and as a tablet.I\u2019m partial to the Chromebook Pixel Go for $649. That system\u2019s premium feel and fantastic keyboard, not to mention solid performance make it excellent for typing papers, web browsing, or kicking back and watching Netflix.Wi-Fi mesh routersIf your child is starting the school year at home, you\u2019re going to need a strong Wi-Fi signal. And while standard routers are fine for most apartments and houses, those with annoying dead spots can benefit from the addition of a mesh router system.Unlike normal routers, which send out and receive wireless signals from a single point, mesh routers sit in multiple points throughout your home, bouncing signals off of each other and blanketing your entire space with Wi-Fi connectivity.The Eero mesh router system can help bring Wi-Fi connectivity to your entire home. (Image: Eero)There are a multitude of mesh routers available, and Google\u2019s Nest Wifi and Eero\u2019s offerings are among some of the best. Google provides a base station and secondary router for $269 and says it can cover as much as 3,800 square feet of space. Eero\u2019s system starts at $249 for three units and can cover up to 5,000 square feet of space.There are a variety of other mesh routers on the market, including from Netgear, Linksys and others, so don\u2019t be afraid to check out the ones that are right for your price range and your home\u2019s size.Wireless earbudsNo matter where children are doing their schooling, they\u2019re going to need something to drown out the noise around them and focus on their work. Wireless earbuds can be a big help in that department. They\u2019re also not bad for listening to music and vegging or blasting tunes while working out.Ever since Apple introduced its AirPods, the market has been flooded with similar wireless earbuds, but Apple is still the top contender when it comes to the category. The original AirPods currently go for $159, but if you want a premium listening experience, I\u2019d opt for Apple\u2019s AirPods Pro for $249. They feature active noise-canceling technology and are both sweat and water resistant.Sony's wireless earbuds are some of the best on the market, and feature active noise-canceling technology. (Image: Sony)If you\u2019re an Android fan or are looking for something a little different, you can choose Sony\u2019s WF-1000XM3 earbuds, which cost $229 and provide excellent audio quality and active noise-canceling technology. Google\u2019s own Pixel Buds, meanwhile, go for $179 and include Google Assistant integration, but lack active noise-cancelling technology.Microsoft has also gotten in on the earbuds trend with its own Surface Earbuds, which feature a slick look and comfortable feel for $199. They don\u2019t, however, have active noise-canceling technology.Smart speakersLet\u2019s face it, whether your child is in middle school, high school, or college, getting up for class is a pain. Thankfully, there\u2019s a new breed of smart speaker that\u2019s small enough for a dorm room, but loud enough to wake up even the heaviest of sleepers.Google\u2019s Nest Mini is a hockey puck-sized smart speaker that comes loaded with Google Assistant for $49. The Mini can play music from Spotify, podcasts, and provide basic information from Assistant.Amazon's Echo Dot is $59 and packs a solid speaker with the company's Alexa voice assistant. (Image: Amazon)Then there\u2019s Amazon\u2019s Echo Dot. Like the Nest Mini, the Echo Dot takes up minimal space on a nightstand and can stream music, podcasts, and offer basic information via Amazon\u2019s Alexa voice assistant. The Dot, however, costs $59 and features a digital clock on its front.Happy shopping!Got a tip?
