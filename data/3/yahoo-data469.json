TikTok has said it would not comply with any request to share user data with the Chinese authorities.Beijing has said it firmly opposes Trump's executive orders and on Aug. 28 moved to give itself a say in the process, revising a list of technologies that will need Chinese government approval before they are exported. Experts said TikTok's recommendation algorithm would fall under this list.Chinese regulators said last week the rules were not targeted at specific companies but they reaffirmed their right to enforce them.(Reporting by Keith Zhai in Singapore, Yingzhi Yang and Gabriel Crossley in Beijing, Julie Zhu in Hong Kong, and Echo Wang in New York; Editing by Brenda Goh, Tony Munroe and Alexander Smith and Mark Potter)"}]}
