He said the shift is \u201ca function of renewed sentiment for the stock market, rather than a souring on real estate.\u201dIn 2019, 31% of Americans preferred real estate and only 20% chose stocks as their favorite long-term investment. During the coronavirus, the S&P 500 regained 20% of its value in the second quarter (after dropping 35% in March) and in the process caught investors\u2019 eye.\u201cThe timing of [2020\u2019s] polling came on the heels of a very strong market run,\u201d said McBride.The poll\u2019s finding parallels the rise of Robinhood and other investing apps, which have attracted millions of new investors during the coronavirus pandemic. E*Trade Financial Corp. gained 260,500 retail accounts in March, according to reports, while Robinhood gained 3 million new accounts in the first quarter.\u201cWe see some demographic overlap [with new trading apps] for sure. Millennials had a notable shift away from real estate and toward stocks,\u201d said McBride. Older millennials (ages 31-39) were more likely to favor the stock market, with 33% choosing it as their favorite long-term investment. Only the silent generation (age 75+) had a stronger affinity for stocks (43%).But while some are more bullish on stocks, the coronavirus has had polarizing effects. A quarter of respondents said they would invest in stocks less aggressively. More than half of those who did not select the stock market as their top investment choice pointed to volatility during the pandemic as a reason why they stayed away, according to the survey.Story continues\u201cThere continues to be evidence of rattled nerves from the sharp swoon earlier in the year\u2026 More said they were going to invest less aggressively because of the pandemic. It\u2019s love it or leave it \u2014 there\u2019s not a whole lot of middle ground, it seems,\u201d said McBride.But as the market moderates, real estate is expected to regain its spot as America\u2019s favorite way to build wealth, said McBride.Sarah Paynter is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
