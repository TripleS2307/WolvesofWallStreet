Over 14% of renters and 6.4% of homeowners \u2014 17 million Americans total \u2014 reported being behind on housing payments last month, according to the Census, though most have arranged forbearance or alternative (partial or delayed) payment schedules with landlords and lenders, according to the National Multifamily Housing Council.\u201c2020 has really taken whatever existing disparities were there and stretched them out to very meaningful gaps,\u201d said Popov.Renters are already less likely to vote than homeowners, and during the pandemic, renters have had significantly more financial hardship, with higher rates of unemployment and lower rates of savings. Only 48% of tenants behind on rent payments plan to vote on November 3, compared to 60% of homeowners who missed mortgage payments, according to the study.\u201cThough pain is widespread, it\u2019s concentrated in a lot of the occupations and demographic groups and income brackets where renters are overrepresented,\u201d said Popov.Voting based on housing payments.
