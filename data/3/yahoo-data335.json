So we\u2019re very, very concerned about that.\u201dSchools \u2018may be an opportunity to spread this disease more\u2019Trantalis said the decision to reopen schools is not made by him, but rather the school board.\u201cIt\u2019s a different level of government,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes its own decisions. But we\u2019re very concerned about bringing kids into schools when, in fact, that may be an opportunity to spread this disease more so than it has been in the past.\u201dA counselor wearing a protective face mask plays with children as summer camps reopen amid the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Milford, Michigan, U.S., June 23, 2020.

He also criticized the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for its reopening guidelines.The current guidelines encourage behaviors including staying home when necessary, hand hygiene, using a tissue to cover coughs and sneezes, wearing cloth face coverings, and more. But as a result of Trump\u2019s tweet, the director of the CDC, Robert Redfield, said they would be issuing new guidelines next week.I disagree with @CDCgov on their very tough & expensive guidelines for opening schools. While they want them open, they are asking schools to do very impractical things. I will be meeting with them!!!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 8, 2020The key is for communities to practice proper hygiene and social distancing measures so that it lessens the risk of their children being exposed and passing it on to others once they\u2019re in school.\u201cWe have a lot of challenges here,\u201d Trantalis said. \u201cWe have a lot of trade-offs here and it\u2019s difficult to try to understand some of the decisions being made by those at the county level or even the state level as we plow our way through this pandemic, keeping in mind that the most important thing we can do is personal responsibility. Maintaining masks, washing hands, staying your distance. We\u2019re told time and again that\u2019s the best way to prevent this from being spread. So it\u2019s a challenge and we leave it up to the medical experts to give us direction going forward.\u201d\u201cI think that if we\u2019re able to really, really be serious about these practices that the CDC has recommended \u2014 the social distancing, washing hands, and wearing the masks where appropriate \u2014 we can beat this,\u201d he added. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to take that step backwards because the consequences are catastrophic.\u201dAdriana is a reporter and editor covering politics and health care policy for Yahoo Finance.
