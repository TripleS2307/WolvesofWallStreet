In a video shared on Twitter afterwards, Trump reiterated a message from earlier in the day.Trump announced he would be leaving Walter Reed on Twitter, while also spreading what some experts say is a dangerous public health message.\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of Covid. Don\u2019t let it dominate your life. We have developed, under the Trump Administration, some really great drugs & knowledge,\u201d Trump said.In the video, later, Trump reiterated the line, \u201cdon\u2019t let it dominate your lives. Get out there. Be careful. The vaccines are coming, momentarily.\u201dDr. Eric Feigl-Ding, a health economist and epidemiologist, said Trump\u2019s message misses the mark for most Americans.\u201cI would love (Trump\u2019s) quality of health care, getting all this unapproved antibody cocktails around the clock, for only $750 a year (in taxes),\u201d Feigl-Ding said. \u201cMost people don\u2019t have that.\u201dTrump\u2019s message also reflects poorly on the 200,000 lives lost, and continued case growth \u2014 as anticipated\u2014 now and in the coming months, he said.Dr. Peter Hotez, a vaccine expert and Baylor College of Medicine professor shared a similar sentiment to Trump\u2019s tweet, saying it sent a \u201cchilling message.\u201d\u201cIt says he\u2019s learned nothing about the severity of COVID19, how the White House refusal to launch a national response to virus caused so much suffering and death, and how he may have survived his case because of privileged access to biotechnologies denied to others,\u201d Hotez told Yahoo Finance.White House physician Dr. Sean Conley said Trump\u2019s departure from the hospital was in line with the medical team\u2019s assessment of Trump\u2019s health status, but refrained from sharing additional details, including information about Trump\u2019s CT scan, citing patient privacy, or when his last negative COVID-19 test was.Story continuesConley noted that Trump has been fever-free, without any fever-reducing medication, for 72 hours, and that he could be in the phase of the infection that ensure he does not have traces of \u201ca live virus still present that he could possibly transmit to others\u201d\u2014 indicating a later stage of the infection window. If lab results show that to be true, Trump could return to the campaign trail.\u201cWe\u2019re in a bit of uncharted territory when it comes to a patient that received the therapies he has so early in the course,\u201d Conley said, noting he and the team remained cautiously optimistic.Conley said Trump appeared to be in good spirits and did not appear to have any visible neurological impact, as seen in videos over the weekend. \u201cHe\u2019s back,\u201d Conley said.White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany, as well as additional staffers and White House cleaning staff, announced on Monday that they tested positive for COVID-19 \u2014 the latest in a growing list of Republican officials linked to Trump, who is currently undergoing treatment for the virus as questions swirl around his condition.In the days following Trump\u2019s stunning disclosure that he was infected with the coronavirus, several GOP senators and key functionaries in his inner circle have also received positive diagnoses. The furor was sparked last week after Hope Hicks was revealed to have the virus, the first revelation that the pandemic had hit the White House hard, roiling the president\u2019s already turbulent reelection effort.McEnany said she had consistently tested negative in the past few days, and was not showing any symptoms.The crisis engulfing the White House was amplified on Monday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which updated its guidelines to address a point many experts have previously stressed \u2014 that it is possible for the virus to spread beyond six feet, the benchmark for social distancing measures. Last month, the agency published that same guidance but quickly removed it, in a move that fanned new accusations that the CDC\u2019s decisions were being politicized.Meanwhile, questions have surfaced about the lack of transparency surrounding when Trump first contracted the virus, the limited information on contact tracing efforts \u2014 and how serious his condition might be despite rosy assurances by his medical team.Health experts are concerned the White House has been concealing a more serious COVID-19 infection, especially as he receives a number of aggressive treatment cocktails.The President\u2019s physician, Dr. Sean Conley, admitted to wanting to keep an optimistic tone while Trump \u2014 who over the weekend embarked on a much maligned pass and review via car for the benefit of his supporters \u2014 was at Walter Reed Military Medical center.\u201cI was trying to reflect the upbeat attitude that the team, the President, that his course of illness, have had,\u201d Conley said, adding that he didn\u2019t want to provide any information that would \u201csteer the course of the illness in another direction.\u201dConley confirmed several reports Sunday that Trump had received supplemental oxygen after his saturation level dropped just below a concerning level while at the White House.There is a surge in cases in New York, New Hampshire, and Connecticut. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)Social distancing and airborne spreadThe latest revision by the CDC states that in indoors spaces, where air circulation can be poorer, the virus can spread further than six feet and droplets can linger in the air for hours \u2014 which can infect someone who breathes in the air.The question of how far the virus can spread was discussed in an article by Italian researchers in April, who pointed to evidence that droplets travel further than six feet. The CDC is now embracing the existing evidence on the topic.The agency \u201ccontinues to believe, based on current science, that people are more likely to become infected the longer and closer they are to a person with COVID-19,\u201d it said in a statement.\u201cToday\u2019s update acknowledges the existence of some published reports showing limited, uncommon circumstances where people with COVID-19 infected others who were more than 6 feet away or shortly after the COVID-19-positive person left an area,\u201d it added.A range of cocktails for Trump\u2019s treatmentTrump has has no fever since Friday, his vital signs are stable, and he has not complained of shortness of breath, even when his oxygen saturation levels were lower.According to doctors, he has been able to walk around the whole time. If all goes well with Trump remaining mobile and active, the doctors could discharge him as early as Monday.However, over the last few days Trump has received Regeneron\u2019s (REGN) experimental antibody cocktail treatment, Gilead Sciences\u2019 (GILD) remdesivir, and dexamethasone, a generic steroid usually reserved for use in severe COVID-19 cases. Both stocks spiked in intraday trading, as investors speculated their role in the president\u2019s treatment would bolster their chances for regulatory approval.Yale University professor and health police expert Dr. Howard Forman told Yahoo Finance said the variety of medications Trump has received give a confusing message about at what point in the infection course he is current in.\u201cThey\u2019re treating him almost as thought he\u2019s past the 10 day window after infection,\u201d which could indicate he is past a point of serious concern, Forman said.\u201cBut again, they have not been clear with exactly what\u2019s going on. By the way, this is a problem with presidencies in both parties going back decades and decades,\u201d Forman said. He referred to past presidents who were able to conceal the extent of their illnesses.Regeneron\u2019s treatment was given to the president based on a compassionate use basis, and has given analysts reason to believe the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is likely to provide an emergency use authorization soon. In a research note on Monday, SVB Leerink analysts speculated that an EUA could come \u201cin a matter of days.\u201dYahoo medical contributor Dr. Dara Kass said there simply isn\u2019t enough public information about the President\u2019s health to understand how he is being treated\u2014 or why doctors are considering releasing him to the White House Monday.\u201cIt\u2019s surprising to a lot of us that given the number of medication that he has received, the conflicting evidence of his vital signs, that they would stop being cautious and be frivolous with his care,\u201d Kass said.\u201cThe videos we are seeing are inconsistent with the treatment he is getting,\u201d she added.Trump tweeted videos on Saturday and Sunday evenings, assuring the American people he was feeling fine, and drove by a crowd on Sunday outside the hospital.More from Anjalee:Redfield: CDC 'preparing earnestly' for vaccine in November, DecemberDoctors, scientists increasingly political amid COVID-19 pandemic: 'Public health is on the ballot'India's tech giants navigate 'literally spiking' WFH demand, H1-B fears in coronavirus eraRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube."}]}
