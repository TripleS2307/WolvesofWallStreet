Sorrell told Yahoo Finance. \u201cAnd the answer: political pressure and money.\u201d(Michael Sorrell. Screenshot: Paul Quinn College)Paul Quinn is a historically Black college based in Dallas, Texas, with around 550 students. Sorrell, the longest-serving president in the school\u2019s 146-year history, is credited with turning the school\u2019s fortunes around after taking the job in March 2007 as the fourth president in four years.The school was one of the very first in Texas to transition to remote learning amid the coronavirus pandemic.\u201cAll summer long, we've watched the number of cases just escalate and escalate and escalate, and if someone had said to us in the spring that there'd be this many cases in the fall, none of us would've thought about opening schools, right?\u201d Sorrell said. \u201cWhen we closed it, it was a dream compared to where we are now.\u201dThere are over 5.1 million coronavirus cases in the U.S. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)\u2018People in their 20s, 30s, and 40s are increasingly driving its spread\u2019The World Health Organization (WHO) recently noted a rise in coronavirus cases in young people around the world.\u201cThe epidemic is changing,\u201d Dr. Takeshi Kasai, WHO Regional Director for the Western Pacific, said during a briefing this week. \u201cPeople in their 20s, 30s and 40s are increasingly driving its spread. Many are unaware they're infected, with very mild symptoms or none at all.\u201dConsequently, Dr. Kasai added, new outbreaks can occur when younger people \u201cunknowingly passing on the virus to others... [and] increases the risk of spill-overs to the most vulnerable: The elderly, the sick people in long-term care, people who live in densely populated urban areas and underserved rural areas.\u201dStory continuesA student checks in to the NYU dorms in the East Village as the city continues Phase 4 of re-opening following restrictions imposed to slow the spread of coronavirus on August 18, 2020 in New York City. (PHOTO: Noam Galai/Getty Images)Sorell said his decision to keep students and staff off campus was based on two calculations.\u201cNumber one: Did we have the ability to police?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I do mean that word, literally police the lives of our students every minute of every day of every week of every month of the semester. And the answer is of course not \u2014 but that's what you need to do to have a shot at being successful. It's not going to succeed.\u201dAt least one school is trying a literal policing strategy: Boston College is hiring Boston police detail to keep an eye on parties on off-campus housing on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights.\u201cYou can't make this stuff up, right?\u201d Sorrell said. \u201cAsk yourself how much money it would have to cost to hire police force to police parties. How could that money have been spent?\u201dAlbion College, a private school in Michigan, is relying on technology to stop the spread: Students are reportedly required to download an app that tracks at all times their physical locations and their private health data while residing in the 4.5-mile perimeter on campus.Colleges for years have struggled to control student behavior. Think about efforts re: binge drinking, Greek life, the list goes on. Now they're depending on that tenuous control for fall.

(PHOTO: REUTERS/Brad Brooks)\u201cYou're going to need an entire office devoted to COVID-19 people whose job is to wait around, make sure people had on masks, testing, make sure people aren't seeing too close each other,\u201d Sorrell said. \u201cThat's an awful lot of resources to lose. What can we do with those resources instead of running a failed operation?\u201dA chart by Goldman Sachs, showing how the number of COVID-19 cases at universities increased substantially between the initial testing period and more recent tests, illustrated how difficult preventing outbreaks can be.(Goldman Sachs)In the end, Sorrell reiterated, public institutions of all kinds need to recognizes the severity of the situation.\u201cWe have failed government policy, we have failed public health policy, we have failed government economic policy,\u201d he asserted. \u201cAll because we refuse to just acknowledge the truth.\u201d\u2014Aarthi Swaminathan is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering education.
