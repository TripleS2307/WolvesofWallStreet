Overall trips, including air, road, cruise, and rail travel, are expected to fall 15% this summer to mark the first decline in national travel for the season since 2009, though road trips are expected to see a lesser hit.\u201cAmericans will get out and explore this summer though they\u2019re taking a \u2018wait and see approach\u2019 when it comes to booking and are likely to book more long weekend getaways than extended vacations,\u201d said AAA\u2019s Senior Vice President of Travel Paula Twidale.(Source: AAA Summer Travel Report)Summer road trips in 2020 are expected to see a slight decline of just 3% compared to last year, while AAA projects summer rail and cruise travel to collapse a whopping 85%. The same report pegs the decline in summer air travel at nearly 74% versus last year\u2019s travel season.That shift in travel preference, according to AAA, is expected to make the American road trip the most popular it\u2019s been in the past five years. Road trips are expected to make up 97% of all summer trips compared to the five-year average share of 87%.\u2018Quite the rollercoaster\u2019For car sharing platform Turo, which has been dubbed the Airbnb for cars by letting people rent out their own cars, the rise it\u2019s seeing in road trip interest seems to be gaining steam since when the pandemic first hit, according to Turo CEO Andre Haddad.\u201cIt\u2019s been quite the rollercoaster over the last three months,\u201d he told Yahoo Finance. \u201c[We saw] demand plummet in March, in fact back then we had three days where we had more cancelations than actual bookings.\u201d Since then, however, bookings on the car platform have rebounded to pace 10% to 15% above last year.Story continues\u201cWhat we\u2019re finding in terms of trends is that folks are picking up more locally to do these local trips,\u201d he said. \u201cTrips are a bit shorter than last year as people take shorter vacations and travel fewer miles despite the drop in gas [prices].\u201dZack Guzman is the host of YFi PM as well as a senior writer and on-air reporter covering entrepreneurship, cannabis, startups, and breaking news at Yahoo Finance.
