But after alerting the online brokerage to what she believed was a theft in progress, she received a frustrating email.The firm wrote it would investigate and respond within \u201ca few weeks.\u201d Now her money is gone.Bagheri is among five Robinhood customers who recounted similar experiences to Bloomberg News, saying they\u2019ve been left in limbo in recent weeks after someone sold their investments and withdrew funds. Because the wildly popular app has no emergency phone number, some said they tried in vain to intervene, only to watch helplessly as their money vanished.\u201cA limited number of customers appear to have had their Robinhood account targeted by cyber criminals because of their personal email account (that which is associated with their Robinhood account) being compromised outside of Robinhood,\u201d a spokesman for the company said in an email. \u201cWe\u2019re actively working with those impacted to secure their accounts.\u201dThe issue didn\u2019t stem from a breach of Robinhood\u2019s systems, the spokesman said.SEC, FinraBagheri, a Washington attorney, and three other Robinhood users said they also contacted authorities including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Two of those customers said they have heard back from an official at the SEC seeking more information.Finra and the SEC declined to comment.Robinhood, founded seven years ago and based in Menlo Park, California, has exploded in popularity this year as millions of Americans stuck at home -- including throngs of millennials -- look to make some money during a pandemic that has sent stock prices swinging. But the no-fee brokerage app has also attracted consumer complaints, with novice investors confused by the vagaries of stock options and margin loans.Now, even though the firm said this year that it has more than doubled its customer-service team, clients complain they\u2019re struggling to get quick help when their funds are disappearing.Story continues\u201cThey don\u2019t have a customer service line, which I\u2019m quite shocked about,\u201d Bagheri said.\u2018Mental Stress\u2019Pruthvi Rao, a Chicago software engineer, said his account was hit on Oct. 6. His bet on Netflix Inc. was liquidated and $2,850 was soon withdrawn. He said he\u2019s sent more than a dozen emails to Robinhood\u2019s customer support address, and that he even tried messaging some of the brokerage\u2019s executives on LinkedIn.\u201cI\u2019m in tremendous mental stress right now because this is all of my savings,\u201d said Rao, 36, whose account was frozen by Robinhood in response to the fraudulent activity. He said Robinhood contacted him on Friday and unlocked the account after sending several emails late Thursday asking for help.Rao showed Bloomberg the same emailed response from Robinhood that Bagheri received. \u201cWe understand the sensitivity of your situation and will be escalating the matter to our fraud investigations team,\u201d Robinhood customer service agents wrote them. \u201cPlease be aware that this process may take a few weeks, and the team working on your case won\u2019t be able to provide constant updates.\u201dRao said he had previously set up two-factor authentication to access his account, and Bagheri said she\u2019s certain her Robinhood password is unique from all others, including her email. Neither believed they had been duped by phishing scams or malware. Both said they use the same email for Robinhood and other accounts, and that only Robinhood has been affected.\u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s a common occurrence that online accounts of monetary value are bought, sold and traded by cyber-criminals,\u201d said Mark Arena, CEO of Intel 471, which monitors activities of digital criminals. \u201cThis shows the importance of people practicing common information-security hygiene such as not re-using the same password across multiple accounts and enabling two-factor authentication, which Robinhood supports.\u201dStock, BitcoinThey also said Robinhood\u2019s online portal showed their money went to a recipient at Revolut, another popular financial-technology startup. London-based Revolut, which offers a money transfer and exchange app, expanded to the U.S. this year.\u201cRevolut has been made aware of the issue and is investigating urgently,\u201d a company spokesman said Friday in an email.Bill Hurley, who owns a metal-fabrication shop in Windsor, Connecticut, said he received notifications that stock and Bitcoin had been sold from his account on Sept. 21, and that $5,000 was transferred to Revolut accounts in two transactions. He said he emailed Robinhood for assistance while the transactions were pending but received none.\u201cThey\u2019ve had more than enough time to deal with this,\u201d he said.Hurley, 56, said he reached out to the SEC and heard back from a lawyer for the regulator, who asked for additional information on what had happened.After more than two weeks of emails seeking help from Robinhood, a customer support representative called him on Thursday, he said.(Updates with cyber-security expert comment in 15th paragraph.
