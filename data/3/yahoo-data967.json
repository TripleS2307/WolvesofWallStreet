In turn, companies of all walks are being battered financially by the coronavirus pandemic. Millions of people across the country remain out of work. When they will return to work is anyone\u2019s guess. The folks down in D.C. can\u2019t agree on a fresh round of stimulus to support those unemployed fellow Americans.And yet, there is the S&P 500 on the cusp of a record.Talk up people on Wall Street (digitally of course, not in person because of that aforementioned pandemic) and the reason for the market\u2019s ongoing resilience isn\u2019t that bewildering. In effect, Mr. Market is done with 2020 and has already built a home in 2021. That home is surrounded by acres of much better earnings reports from Corporate America, a COVID-19 vaccine, low interest rates from the Federal Reserve and a conclusion (hopefully...) to the presidential election.It\u2019s a land way more fun than 2020, which explains why Mr. Market is eager to call it home.\u201cI think the market is clearly looking to next year\u2019s earnings. If you think about next year\u2019s earnings on the S&P 500 they could be $170. A 21 times P/E multiple [on those earnings] would dictate an S&P 500 that is probably, believe it or not, 100 points higher than now. So much of this is what happens to next year\u2019s earnings,\u201d Wells Fargo Asset Management global chief investment officer Kirk Hartman told Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade.Photo by: STRF/STAR MAX/IPx 2020Hartman is among the early group on Wall Street to highlight the focus by sophisticated investors on 2021.Earlier this week, Goldman Sachs strategist David Kostin reiterated his 2021 S&P 500 earnings estimate of $170. The number is some 30% above the current consensus forecast. If hit, it would represent a 31% year-over-year increase in earnings for the S&P 500.\u201cThe primary driver of our above-consensus 2021 forecast is our economic growth outlook,\u201d Kostin writes, pointing out Goldman\u2019s macroeconomic team is looking for 5.6% GDP growth next year. For 2020, Goldman forecasts a 5% GDP decline.Story continuesAdds Kostin, \u201cWhile positive consensus EPS revisions are rare, they typically occur as the economy emerges from recessions.\u201dSo in other words, expect others on Wall Street to start buying homes in 2021 and stocks to possibly maintain an upward bias.
