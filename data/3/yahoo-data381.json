The burden is even greater among households who rent: one in four renters with children missed payments in May, compared to only one in six without children.June payment rates are not yet available, but 13.9% of households with children said they had \u201cno confidence\u201d they could pay rent in June, compared to only 7.4% of households without children. For mortgaged households, 4.3% with children said they had \u201cno confidence\u201d they could pay their mortgage, compared to 2.2% of households without children, according to Census data.Credit: GettyThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act prohibited evictions and created forbearance options in properties with federally-backed mortgages, but those protections are set to expire on August 31. Over 30 states have also issued bans on evictions and penalties for not paying housing costs, with varying expiration dates.\u201cThe government must step in with effective housing policy, like direct, emergency rental assistance, to ensure families remain in their homes,\u201d said Bob Pinnegar, president and CEO of the National Apartment Association, an Arlington, Va.-based trade association.Story continuesOn top of additional expenses associated with raising children, households with children had increased rates of job loss during the pandemic. Some 55.2% of households with children under age 18 had at least one adult lose their job during the pandemic, compared to 43.6% in households without children.In addition to housing instability, 3.9 million children have also gone hungry during the pandemic \u2014 and 1.3 million children have experienced both housing instability and food insecurity, according to the Census Bureau.\u201cIf greater assistance isn\u2019t forthcoming soon, then families with children will face even more challenges this fall when schools may not be in session and the ability of parents to provide childcare is limited,\u201d said Cino.Sarah Paynter is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
