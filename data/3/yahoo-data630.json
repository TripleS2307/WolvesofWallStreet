He would have a consistent message. And he would listen to the scientists. That\u2019s a big difference,\u201d Lamont said on Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade. Lamont \u2014 a Democrat credited for a near expert handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in his state of 3.5 million residents \u2014 was among the first to support Joe Biden\u2019s run for the White House.Suffice it to say, Trump\u2019s handling of the health crisis has been anything but consistent.This week, members of the administration \u2014 namely trade hawk Peter Navarro \u2014 have publicly criticized the nation\u2019s leading infectious disease specialist Dr. Anthony Fauci. The bizarre attacks have been met with swift backlash from both sides of the aisle given Fauci\u2019s impressive track record and good standing in the public.Democratic presidential candidate, former Vice President Joe Biden removes a face mask to protect against the spread of the new coronavirus as he arrives to speak at Alexis Dupont High School in Wilmington, Del., Tuesday, June 30, 2020. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)\u201cI think it\u2019s dumb,\u201d Lamont \u2014 who has consulted with Fauci frequently during the pandemic \u2014 said of the public attacks. \u201cI mean, Fauci has so much credibility on both sides of the aisle, and with consumers, and business and labor. You want somebody with credibility talking to the groups out there so we know what\u2019s going on.\u201dThe criticism of Fauci comes amid disappointment in how the administration has managed the pandemic \u2014 everything from the president refusing to wear a mask to continued downplaying of the threat to public health.Meanwhile, COVID-19 continues to rage on in the country and in fact, may be picking up steam again as some states likely opened too soon.There has been more than 13.8 million confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide, with the U.S. having 3.53 million of them. Out of the 591,000 worldwide deaths, the U.S. has had 138,000.Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
