Powell pointed to the May jobs report surprise as a function of the Fed\u2019s accommodative policies.Powell\u2019s testimony was his first since officially firing up all 11 of its liquidity facilities, touching markets ranging from U.S. dollars to risky corporate debt. The last of its facilities, a program to purchase bonds directly from the corporate issuers themselves, officially opened up for business on Monday.Lawmakers on Tuesday were particularly interested in the Main Street Lending Program, which hopes to offer loans to businesses with less than 15,000 employees, only recently opened up for lender registration. Powell said about 300 lenders had so far registered, a small number when considering there are over 5,000 banks and savings institutions in the U.S.Asked if the Fed could further expand the scope of the facility, Powell said he could see the Fed \u201cdown the road looking at a lower threshold\u201d for the program\u2019s minimum loan size, which is currently $250,000. Powell and Mnuchin also said it was evaluating offering an asset-based test for program eligibility, acknowledging that the existing EBITDA test may not be appropriate for some types of borrowers.Story continuesThe announcement effectFederal Reserve Chair Jerome H.

Powell pointed to the fact that Illinois was able to get most of its financing in the private market after the MLF was set up, relying on the Fed for only the last piece of its fundraising needs.Although the facility has the power to support up to $500 billion in short-term municipal debt, the MLF had only taken on $1.2 billion through the program as of June 24.\u201cThat announcement has had an enormous effect on the functioning of that market,\u201d Powell told Congress.Some lawmakers pressed Mnuchin and Powell on funding pressures specifically in commercial real estate and commercial mortgage-backed securities, worrying that travel disruptions may result in financing troubles for hotels in particular.Mnuchin suggested that the Fed and the Treasury had looked at some facility to address those concerns but faced \u201cstructural problems\u201d in setting one up, adding that the companies likely wouldn\u2019t benefit from more debt. Mnuchin punted the issue back to Congress, emphasizing that a second relief package should include \u201cadditional funding\u201d targeting specific industries to keep hotel employees, for example, on payroll.Powell agreed, adding that \u201cmore debt may not be the answer, debt doesn't solve every problem.\u201dThe Fed\u2019s next policy-setting meeting will be July 28 and 29.Brian Cheung is a reporter covering the Fed, economics, and banking for Yahoo Finance.
