More generally, the FBI describes \u201cconspiracy theory-driven domestic extremists\u201d as a growing threat.And while President Trump has not outwardly supported QAnon, he has retweeted its conspiracy theories on multiple occasions (while his son, Eric, posted and then deleted a QAnon graphic on Instagram ahead of Trump\u2019s campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma). Trump\u2019s supporters, though, have been more vocal about it.Eric Trump posting a QAnon graphic on Instagram pic.twitter.com/4U7QX1MIlr\u2014 Jared Holt (@jaredlholt) June 20, 2020\u201cTrump supporters\u2019 fixation on QAnon shows that they really don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re winning, even as they hold the reins of power,\u201d Paul Musgrave, an assistant professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, wrote in the Washington Post. \u201cThe mystique of QAnon is yet another example of how Trumpism is built on the politics of resentment.\u201dConspiracy theories \u2018fill an important psychological role for many people\u2019QAnon began with \u201cQ,\u201d a persona claiming to be someone within the government, promising to expose how dark forces are working against Trump and his administration. The \u201cAnon\u201d part comes from Q\u2019s readers, who decipher Q\u2019s \u201cclues\u201d on message boards and build outlandish interpretations. Posters named \u201cQ\u201d have been instigating unfounded theories on social networks including 4Chan, 8Chan, and Reddit.\u201c[Conspiracy theories] like this fill an important psychological role for many people,\u201d Thomas J. Wood, an assistant professor of Political Science at Ohio State University who has studied how conspiracy theories gain public support, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cIt tends to sway those who have chronic anxiety and feel disaffected by politics by providing a symbolic and intuitive story for them.\u201dStory continuesA Q-Anon supporter during a protest at the State Capitol in Salem, Oregon, United States on May 2, 2020.

Conspiracy theories also seem to be more compelling to those with low self-worth, especially with regard to their sense of agency in the world at large. Conspiracy theories appear to be a way of reacting to uncertainty and powerlessness.\u201dThe movement has reached the point where politicians openly supporting QAnon are being elected: Lauren Boebert won the Republican congressional primary for her Colorado district despite her opponent being an incumbent backed by Trump. Boebert has spoken positively of QAnon, stating: \u201cI hope that this is real because it only means America is getting stronger and better, and people are returning to conservative values, and that\u2019s what I am for. ... If this is real, then it could be really great for our country.\u201dConspiracy theorist QAnon demonstrators protest during a rally to re-open California and against Stay-At-Home directives on May 1, 2020 in San Diego, California.

Back in 2017, Green described \u201cQ\u201d as \u201ca patriot.\u201d\u201cHe is someone that very much loves his country, and he\u2019s on the same page as us, and he is very pro-Trump,\u201d Greene said. \u201cI\u2019m very excited about that now there\u2019s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take this global cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles out, and I think we have the president to do it.\u201d\u2018A collective populous moving further away from critical thinking\u2019Much of the traction stems from a distrust in the media and the government. QAnon appears to be an evolution of Pizzagate, the internet conspiracy theory that led one man to bring a gun to a pizza shop because he thought there were child slaves in the basement.Wood said there\u2019s always a chance of unfounded allegations like these picking up steam and spilling into the mainstream, which happened with Pizzagate or Obama birtherism (i.e., the notion that the former president was born outside of the U.S.).QAnon supporters are convinced that the government is working against Trump and his administration. REUTERS/Leah MillisSocial media plays a major role in it as well. A viral conspiracy theory about Justin Bieber being a victim of Pizzagate went viral recently on TikTok, a video app popular among young adults. And private Facebook groups are reportedly becoming a new haven for QAnon supporters to share their conspiracy theories with each other.Based on Wood\u2019s research, groups like QAnon rely on the attention they receive from the public, particularly the media: \u201cFor the theory to cross over and gain mainstream currency, it can\u2019t just exist in the pockets of a chatroom,\u201d he said.\u2018It will continue to happen\u2019The conditions that created QAnon will continue to exist for the foreseeable future.A Donald Trump supporter holding a QAnon flag visits Mount Rushmore National Monument on July 01, 2020 in Keystone, South Dakota.
