REUTERS/Carlos Barria\u201cThe use of convalescent plasma for infections has been around for 100 years,\u201d Dr. Dara Kass, an associate professor of emergency medicine at Columbia University, said on Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade (video above). \u201cThere\u2019s no breakthrough here \u2026 even with convalescent plasma being used for the coronavirus.\u201cThe data that is being used by the FDA to put this EUA through is not strong and really has been manipulated, we think, a little bit just to prove a benefit that actually isn\u2019t even between people that didn\u2019t get plasma but really between people that got it before three days and got it after three days,\u201d she continued.Nurse Practitioner Gabriela Huyke prepares for medical examination of a volunteer for the COVID-19 vaccine study at the Research Centers of America (RCA) in Hollywood, Florida, on August 13, 2020.

(Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images)Convalescent plasma works by being taken from those who have already recovered from the coronavirus and have the antibodies, and then purified and administered to those currently battling the virus. From there, the body uses those antibodies to fight off the infection. This treatment has been used on more than 70,000 patients so far, with successful results.\u201cPlasma is safe and every study that\u2019s been done has shown that it\u2019s safe,\u201d Kass said. The bigger concern, however, \u201cis that if the administration is interested in bullying the FDA to pass an EUA for the plasma, what would they do for a vaccine? And I think the fact that news came out in less than 12 hours from the EUA for the plasma that there may actually be movement towards a vaccine to do the same thing is concerning. Vaccine development has never been done this fast.\u201dA woman walks inside the Research Centers of America in Hollywood, Florida, on August 13, 2020, which is conducting COVID-19 vaccine trials.

Obviously, they are hoping to delay the answer until after November 3rd. Must focus on speed, and saving lives! @SteveFDA\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 22, 2020But this could have dangerous consequences, health experts have warned, as vaccines need to be tested in trials to ensure their safety and efficacy. Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia, which has over 954,000 cases and more than 16,000 deaths from the virus, announced that the country would be rolling out billions of doses of a vaccine for the coronavirus, which would mean skipping over trials.\u201cThe idea that we could do really what Russia has done, which is to skip the phase 3 trials and just put it into human arms under the idea that\u2019s a benefit either politically or personally to anybody, is actually very concerning to us,\u201d Kass said.And she\u2019s not the only one who has expressed skepticism. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID), echoed a similar sentiment.\"I hope that the Russians have actually, definitively proven that the vaccine is safe and effective,\" he told ABC News. \"I seriously doubt that they've done that.\"Cases in the U.S. are down by over 10%. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)While Fauci and Kass, along with many other public health experts, understand the urgency to reopen the economy, they have stressed that in order to fully recover, the virus needs to be dealt with.\u201cThe virus needs to be addressed to get the economy back and going,\u201d Kass said. \u201cWithout addressing the virus, we can do a lot of Band-Aid measures toward the economy.\u201dAdriana is a reporter and editor covering politics and health care policy for Yahoo Finance.
