Williams said he feels that the public is responding well to the Fed\u2019s existing communication which gives the committee more time to brainstorm how it will tie future rate moves to economic conditions.\u201cWe do have some time to think about how we should evolve that guidance as we go forward,\u201d Williams said.The committee has also been debating the usefulness of a monetary policy tool known as yield curve control, in which the central bank would commit to purchasing U.S. Treasuries of a targeted maturity until their yields fall below stated levels.Williams had lukewarm enthusiasm for the idea, floating its use as a \u201cpotential tool\u201d but said he would only want to rely on it if the Fed saw that existing communications were not \u201cbeing as effective as we would like.\u201d[Full Transcript: New York Fed President John Williams speaks with Yahoo Finance]\u2018We\u2019ll get there over the next couple years\u2019Economic data released Thursday morning revealed a mixed view on the recovery. Retail sales numbers showed the optimistic consumer driving a 7.5% spike in June, but Labor Department data showed more than 17 million Americans returning to unemployment insurance for the week ended July 11.Story continuesWilliams said his baseline expectation is still for the economy to see a \u201ccontinued period of economic recovery.\u201d But he added that the economy remains in a \u201cvery deep hole\u201d with the unemployment rate still at 11.1%.\u201cIt\u2019s a situation that changes, is in flux all the time,\u201d Williams told Yahoo Finance. \u201cBut I'm confident that we'll get there over the next couple years and get this economy back full circle.\u201dWith economic activity appearing to bounce back as parts of the economy reopen, the Fed is hoping that its near-zero rates will support the recovery. The Fed, as the banking industry\u2019s bank, has also stood up 11 liquidity facilities to backstop markets ranging from U.S. dollars to municipal debt.New York Federal Reserve President John Williams on February 26, 2015 in New York City.

But Williams says providing the liquidity is necessary to support confidence in the financing markets that support large U.S. employers.\u201cWe're basically in there - not picking winners and losers at all - buying broadly across the market so that markets continue to work,\u201d Williams said.Although the Fed has the capacity to take on as much as $750 billion in assets through the two facilities, the central bank was only holding just over $10 billion in ETFs and bonds as of July 8.Other New York Fed officials, such as executive vice president Daleep Singh, have mentioned in previous remarks that the Fed could reduce its purchases to \u201cvery low levels or stopping entirely\u201d depending on market functioning.\u201cIt's a backstop,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIf the conditions get much worse, then people know the Fed is there to help get support functioning the markets in the flow of credit.\u201dThe Federal Reserve\u2019s next policy-setting meeting will take place July 28 and 29.Brian Cheung is a reporter covering the Fed, economics, and banking for Yahoo Finance.
