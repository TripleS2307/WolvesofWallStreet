The report also cited claims that Amazon retaliated against employees who spoke out about the working conditions in a series of walkouts.Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is seen on a screen as he testifies before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law on \"Online Platforms and Market Power\" in the Rayburn House Office Building on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC on July 29, 2020.

(TSN) and Wells Fargo (WFC) that scored in the bottom 25% among over 600 large firms on each of two assessments that examined a company\u2019s COVID-19 response and its inequality issues.The study based its findings on data collected by a product called Truvalue Platform, which uses artificial intelligence to analyze information drawn from industry, non-governmental organizations, news reports, and other sources.In a statement to Yahoo Finance, an Amazon spokesperson criticized the study, saying it uses the \u201cmeaningless measure of \u2018sentiment about company actions\u2019 and fails to evaluate the actual response \u2014 which in the case of Amazon was proactive, swift and effective.\u201d\u201cAny objective survey of how companies responded to COVID-19 would find that Amazon quickly made changes to our operations and invested heavily in safety measures to keep employees safe,\u201d the spokesperson adds.Story continuesThe report received funding from the Ford Foundation and was carried out by consulting firm KKS Advisors as well as Test of Corporate Purpose, an initiative formed this year to evaluate companies in their response to the pandemic and recent social unrest.According to the report, many of the jobs added by Amazon in the aftermath of the outbreak were inadequate due in part to their use of \u201czero-hour contracts\u201d or contracts that do not guarantee a minimum number of weekly hours.\u201cThe company created numerous jobs, for which it might ostensibly receive credit under a first-pass analysis,\u201d the report says. \u201cHowever, these jobs were largely low-quality, many used zero-hour contracts, and they are unlikely in the medium and long term to align with a stakeholder primacy agenda.\u201dBeginning in March, Amazon workers nationwide held a series of walkouts amid a rising number of cases at the company\u2019s warehouses, citing inadequate safety measures and insufficient paid sick leave, among other issues. By May, about 900 of the company\u2019s 400,000 warehouse workers had been infected and eight had died, according to reports from The New York Times and NBC News.People wait in a line of about one hundred applicants waiting to enter a job fair Wednesday, Aug. 2, 2017, at an Amazon fulfillment center, in Kent, Wash.

Well there\u2019s no free lunch. If you\u2019re doing those things, somebody has got to be paying.\u201d\u201cBlue-collar warehouse workers come behind,\u201d he adds. \u201cTheir experience doesn\u2019t come into the arithmetic.\u201dOverall, the report finds that companies whose CEOs signed the high-minded pledge from the Business Roundtable last year performed slightly better than companies that did not back the commitment in the area of COVID-19 response and slightly worse in the area of inequality issues. The study\u2019s assessment drew on data gathered from February to July.Bray praised the efficient management he witnessed as a white-collar engineer at Amazon but said it occasionally came alongside harmful company practices.\u201cA company can be very well-managed and still have ethical problems,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s surprising even, really.\u201dTech newsletterRead more:'We're risking our lives': Why Amazon warehouse workers are walking out over coronavirus fearsTop unions call for closure of all Amazon warehouses \u2014 experts say it would be disastrousWorkers condemn coronavirus relief bill's loophole for big companiesRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"}]}
