In September 2008, young workers faced an unemployment rate of 9.9%, compared to 5.6% for all workers, according to the New York Fed. By May 2010, even as the stock market had recovered, young workers aged 22 to 27 without a bachelor's degree saw unemployment at 15.7%. Even college graduates had an unlucky unemployment rate of 6.8%.Much has been written about how the Great Recession messed up millennials\u2019 job prospects, finances, and even psyches.The dismal job market kicked off a cycle of unemployment, underemployment, lower wages, which can have lasting effects on careers. Ballooning student debt and rising real estate costs further squeezed millennials.New research examines the lasting impact of the Great Recession and finds that, contrary to earlier findings that says the \u201cscarring\u201d effects fade, they\u2019re actually still being felt \u2013 12 years later. Furthermore, the research indicates the recession hurt millennials who entered the job market even after the economy improved.This also comes as the coronavirus pandemic has ushered in a fresh economic crisis and recession. And in this downturn, the potential effects on younger generations have compounded with the closure of schools and colleges.Students wear protective face masks, graduation caps and graduation gowns outside The New School during the coronavirus pandemic on May 15, 2020 in New York City.

Though it has been previously thought that graduating into a recovered economy was good, this may not be the case, according to Rothstein\u2019s findings.A worrying chart from the New York Fed. (NY Fed)\u201cThe labor market grew steadily stronger through the 2011-2019 period, and overall employment rates rose,\u201d wrote Rothstein. \u201cBut the employment rates of new graduates were stagnant, despite the rising tide.\u201dRothstein found another troubling thing. Previous research has found that the bad economic conditions for recent graduates often lead to lower salaries and underemployment than otherwise in good times \u2014 but that these effects wear off into a worker\u2019s 30s. Rothstein\u2019s research, however, suggests the initial impact is, in fact, prolonged.\u201cInitial conditions also have persistent effects on employment rates that, rather than fading away, last throughout a workers\u2019 career (at least through age 40),\u201d he found.Furthermore, Rothstein found something else seems to be happening in recent recessions that is far worse than in the past.\u201cThere has been an additional change to the employment prospects of recent entrants [to the job market], over and above what is consistent with normal recession effects,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMoreover, this change has persisted into the most recent entrants, who were in middle school during the Great Recession.\u201d\u201cSomething dramatic,\u201d he concludes, has happened, that hamstrung young people despite a rising tide.And now a recession, with no in-person schoolOne interesting criticism about the millennial-graduating-into-a-recession argument is that it\u2019s just a small portion of the generation that actually hit a disastrous job market.Rothstein\u2019s observations that subsequent members of the same generation are still affected illustrate how it can still be bad even if you\u2019re still in high school (or middle school) when a recession hits. But even if that thinking was correct, the current coronavirus crisis one ups the Great Recession because the pandemic has affected schools as well.An unidentified graduating student from Mount San Antonio College holds up her diploma while her family members cheer after receiving it at the school's first drive-thru commencement ceremony for the \"Resilient Class\" of 2020, which includes more than 650 students, June 18, 2020 in Walnut, California. (Photo by ROBYN BECK/AFP via Getty Images)One of Rothstein\u2019s observations is that college enrollment surged during the last crisis, perhaps because many decided to stay in school (or go to graduate school) rather than launch into a poor job market.Now, however, many high schools and colleges are staying closed and conducting classes online, which has its own set of problems.At the same time, for people who are paying for university education, the other side of the column looks just as bad: many schools have not lowered tuition even though the whole college experience will be transformed. Like the past two decades, wage and employment issues may occur in lockstep with rising costs.All this does not bode well for the careers of millennials, who are going two-for-two for horrible recessions, and the Gen Z generation entering the labor market now.\u201cThe employment patterns indicate that we were not well prepared for the pandemic-induced downturn of 2020. The 2020 graduates, and likely those of 2021 and 2022, will enter a labor market that is historically weak,\u201d wrote Rothstein. \u201cThe results here indicate that this will permanently scar them.\u201d---Ethan Wolff-Mann is a writer at Yahoo Finance focusing on consumer issues, personal finance, retail, airlines, and more.
