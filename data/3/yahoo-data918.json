These job applicants say 'cruel' and 'selfish' employers do it too.", "body": "The search for new employment has been brutal for millions of Americans faced with a 10.2% unemployment rate.With more than 58 million Americans losing their jobs since the start of the coronavirus shutdowns in mid-March, competition for the few slots available has been fierce.Job seekers of all ages are being forced to contend with a phenomenon often more familiar to the dating scene \u2013 ghosting. For the romantically uninitiated, that\u2019s when your crush dumps you but never takes the time to pick up the phone to let you know that they\u2019ve moved on.Job seekers are feeling that same sense of rejection, though this time it\u2019s hurting their wallets rather than their hearts.According to a recent LinkedIn poll, 93% of job applicants reported being \u201cghosted\u201d by an employer after an initial in-person interview or after responding to a request for additional information. (The poll surveyed 2,564 LinkedIn voters from Aug. 14-17.)LinkedIn News Editor Andrew Seaman says he was surprised to see that ghosting is \u201cso pervasive.\u201d The poll results he posted hit a nerve, prompting close to a thousand comments from job seekers, recruiters, and workers.\u2018Take \u2018ghosting\u2019 as a gift and keep moving!\u2019Some workers expressed sympathy for job seekers who got ghosted.Not surprisingly recruiters chimed in too, mostly to defend their colleagues.However, not all recruiters were willing to justify it.Seaman encourages ghosted job seekers to follow up with recruiters and hiring managers up to three times, but to keep searching.\u201cEven though people may feel pretty angry and sad that they deserve a response, you want to leave a door open so that a month or two down the road, that recruiter, that hiring manager can say, \u2018hey I\u2019m really sorry about the delay and I think we\u2019re ready to move forward with this position. Are you still interested?\u2019\u201d said Seaman. \u201cYou never want to sort of burn that bridge before you know you\u2019re never gonna go across it.\u201dSeaman said that unless a job seeker has received a firm rejection from an employer, the door is technically still open.Story continues\u201cIt\u2019s obviously difficult when you\u2019re navigating in a job search. There\u2019s a lot of emotions that come with it, but if you email saying you know, I deserve an answer, I demand an answer...it doesn\u2019t bode well,\u201d he said.Overall, hiring has been improving month-over-month, jumping by more than 50% from June to July, according to LinkedIn data. The networking platform reports that the most in-demand jobs in August include financial adviser, software engineer, and salesperson.More from Sibile:Crunch time for United, American and Delta as clock ticks toward deadline, pressuring DC\u2019s warring partiesTrump\u2019s $300 per week unemployment boost \u2018too little, too late\u2019 to help August spending: GoldmanEconomist: Pay people $1K to take a coronavirus vaccine instead of forcing themDemocratic Rep. blasts Trump on USPS woes: \u2018No hope\u2019 of waking up knowing who won the electionTrump payroll tax deferment is \u2018employee relations disaster\u2019Find live stock market quotes and the latest business and finance news"}]}
