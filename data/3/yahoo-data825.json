On Friday, Netflix (NFLX) touched fresh highs after Goldman Sachs increased its price target on the streaming service.\u201cIn the early days of tech, tech was the risky area; now it\u2019s the safe area, and those companies are going to continue to do well,\u201d added McDonald.TGV train at speed (blurred motion)\u2018It\u2019s how much you keep at the end of the day\u2019The strategist warns though of \u201csignificant pullbacks,\u201d highlighting June 11th\u2019s sell-off, when the Dow (^DJIA) slid almost 7%, the largest one-day decline since March.\u201cAs an adviser, if someone hires me today, I can\u2019t put them into FAANGs at these 52-week highs,\u201d said McDonald. \u201cWe\u2019re making money on the downside, buying puts at each of these tops.\u201dAs for the Nasdaq, he says anything aside from big tech is likely to be weak.\u201cEven with big tech like Apple and Amazon, those firms have seen extraordinary run-ups in the month and in the past three months,\u201d he added.\u201cThe best way to approach that from investors in those companies is to put in trailing stops,\u201d said McDonald.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to miss the ride up, but you want to lock in your gains. It\u2019s not how much money you make, it\u2019s how much money you keep at the end of the day.\u201dYahoo Finance PremiumInes covers the U.S. stock market from the floor of the New York Exchange.
