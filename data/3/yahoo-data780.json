But this is getting out of control.\u201dThe United States is rapidly approaching 3 million positive coronavirus cases according to the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 tracker, as the average case count in the country hits another record high.\u201cI\u2019m afraid that the status quo is not going to cut it from this point forward,\u201d said Saag. \u201cAt least for the next eight weeks. So we\u2019re going to probably have to do something different.\u201dDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), warned last week that daily case counts could skyrocket to 100,000 coronavirus cases a day if measures weren\u2019t taken to curb the virus.\u201cAll of the southern states \u2014 and some others \u2014 basically became Missouri. They\u2019re the \u2018show-me\u2019 state. They didn\u2019t believe this was real,\u201d Saag said. \u201cGuess what. It\u2019s very real. So we\u2019ve got to buckle down and take care of ourselves, or else we might see another doubling of the cases up to 100,000 as Dr. Fauci said.\u201dSaag said that even amid spiking case counts, there is a \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d to get coronavirus under control. The infectious disease expert said we should all behave as if we were \u201c80 years old with underlying health conditions.\u201d If we did, he explained, we would all \u201cstay at home, avoid large crowds, and wear a mask everywhere we go.\u201dStory continues\u201cAll of us want to avoid another shelter at home environment,\u201d he said, \u201cbut if we don\u2019t get this right, we\u2019re headed that way.\u201dMost concerning to Saag is the \u201coverwhelming\u201d of health care systems. \u201cHospitals are starting to fill up here in the South,\u201d he said.\u201cAll of us are worried about that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a nightmare scenario \u2014 there is not going to be any room at the end. And patients won\u2019t be able to get in with or without COVID.\u201dKristin Myers is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
