While a potential black eye for the president \u2014 pretty much everyone pays more taxes than he does \u2014 it may not have enough firepower to dislodge anyone in his base, limiting the effect to undecided voters.Debates also matter more to undecided voters, which is why Donovan views the two pieces \u2014 the tax scandal and the debate \u2014 in conjunction.If the news has the potential to move markets, it won\u2019t be realized until after the debate as well as after any subsequent Times stories that the publication said are forthcoming regarding the inner workings of the president\u2019s empire.So far, markets are bracing for significant volatility around election time stemming from the possibility of an uncertain and contested election that is drawn out, similar to Bush v. Gore nearly 20 years ago. That election, in 2000, sent the S&P 500 down 8% in the month after Election Day (it recovered fully, and quickly after). If it turns out that the Times investigation has hurt Trump\u2019s chances, that\u2019s when any effect on the markets will happen.Story continues\u2014Ethan Wolff-Mann is a writer at Yahoo Finance focusing on consumer issues, personal finance, retail, airlines, and more.
