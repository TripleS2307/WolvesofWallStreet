But the regulator banned share buybacks for the third quarter as a precautionary measure.In that decision, the Fed continued to permit dividend payments but only up to a cap (either the amount paid in the previous quarter or the quarterly average of income made over the last four quarters, whichever is less).Jerome Powell, chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, wears a protective mask during a House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis hearing in Washington, D.C., U.S., September 23, 2020. Stefani Reynolds/Pool via REUTERSThe Fed\u2019s announcement Wednesday extends the buyback ban and maintains the cap on dividend payments into the fourth quarter of this year.The decision to extend the share buyback and dividend limitations through the fourth quarter was agreed to by four of the five members of the Federal Reserve\u2019s Board of Governors. Lael Brainard, who also dissented against the action in June, dissented against the decision Wednesday.Brainard had argued in June that she would have liked to see a ban on dividend payments entirely, arguing at the time that allowing distributions of any sort \u201craises the risk they will need to tighten credit or rebuild capital during the recovery.\u201dFederal Reserve Board Governor Lael Brainard speaks at the John F.

REUTERS/Brian SnyderThe Fed had left open the possibility that it would extends its capital distribution restrictions, but some banks were still hopeful they could resume buybacks by the fourth quarter. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CFO Jennifer Piepszak said Sept. 15 she \u201cwouldn\u2019t rule out share buybacks\u201d if regulators permitted it in the fourth quarter.The announcement comes as the Fed undergoes a second stress test, which policymakers launched in an effort to provide a second look at banks through this unprecedented COVID-19 crisis.Story continuesThe Fed said Wednesday the results from that second stress test will be released \u201cby the end of the year.\u201dBrian Cheung is a reporter covering the Fed, economics, and banking for Yahoo Finance.
