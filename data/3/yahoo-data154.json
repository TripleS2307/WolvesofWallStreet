Many Republicans have argued against extending the benefits, saying some workers make more on unemployment than they do at their job, which they say is a disincentive for workers to go back to work.The new poll shows 34% somewhat agree and 28% strongly agree the enhanced benefits discourage people from returning to work.People who have received the additional benefits are less likely to see them as a disincentive for work.A Yahoo Finance poll found 58% of respondents support extending enhanced unemployment benefits beyond July.Of those polled, 44% currently receiving the extra $600 see the benefit as a discouragement from returning to work \u2014 compared to 56% of people who previously received the benefit and 64% of people who never did.Young people are also less likely to see the benefits as a disincentive.

Rob Portman (R-OH) said in an interview with Yahoo Finance.Democratic lawmakers argue the bonus won\u2019t help the many workers who can\u2019t go back to their jobs if their employer went out of business or if their company is still temporarily shut down.The Yahoo Finance-Harris poll found 69% of respondents support a return-to-work bonus \u2013 67% of those currently on unemployment would be more likely to return to their job if they got a bonus for doing so.
