Although recent data suggests passengers are starting to fly again, the airline is moving now to downsize.\u201cYou know that the telltale sign will come October 1. That's when the restrictions around furloughs will come off and my goal, at Delta, is to avoid furloughs in any way we possibly can,\u201d Bastian told Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cOn the Move\u201d in an interview.The air carrier employs 90,000 people. Yet almost half \u2014 more than 40,000 \u2014 have taken voluntary leave to help Delta save money during the COVID-19 crisis.Delta just launched an early retirement program, which Bastian estimates will help it streamline its workforce. The company also cut its cash burn from $100 million a day before the pandemic, to $30 million a day currently. It plans to add 100 flights back to its daily schedule this month as air traffic ticks up again.\u201cYou start to see how the revenue is climbing by staying very disciplined on cost, capping load factors and adding flights back as demand returns,\u201d Bastian said.However, according to the CEO, revenue is only running at 15% of what it was a year ago as passengers start flying again. Delta plans to add around 1000 daily flights in July and August as travel demand slowly recovers.\u201cTraffic is back. It bottomed out in April at 5%,\u2019 he said. \u201cI'd expect over In the next few weeks, that number is going to go to 20% and then, hopefully, eventually 30% by the end of the third quarter.\u201dDefending prior buybacksAs airlines bolster their flight and sanitation policies in the post-lockdown era, Bastian said that he expects Delta to break even next spring.Story continuesIn a recent note to clients, Raymond James Analyst Savanthi Syth said Delta had 14 months cash on hand, and available credit that put its liquidity around $19 billion.\u201cI think Delta's doing the right things in being conservative in how they bring the capacity back,\u201d Syth told Yahoo Finance. \u201cAnd that's because their kind of core business passenger is still not in any meaningful way willing to fly,\u201d she said.One thing that keeps revenue from growing faster is Delta\u2019s decision to only book 60% of its aircraft, and keep middle seats vacant.\u201cWe'll bring the middle seat back when customers tell us that they feel safe flying there and we can sell it just like we sell any of our products,\u201d Bastian told Yahoo Finance, without specifying when that might be.Delta also has the option to borrow an additional $4.6 billion from the U.S. Treasury via secured loans, despite critics who say taxpayers have already given the airlines enough cash.Meanwhile, Syth defended Delta\u2019s decision to spend $16 billion on stock buybacks and dividends between 2013 and 2019. She pointed out that Delta spent more than $103 billion on salaries and benefits during that same time period, while contributing to its pension programs above minimum requirements.\u201cDelta\u2019s capital returns were part of a balanced capital deployment strategy that didn\u2019t result in an over-leveraged situation.\u201d Syth said.She pointed out that had the COVID-19 pandemic been a normal cyclical downturn, \u201cmost U.S. airlines would have been sufficiently capitalized to make it through in my opinion.\u201dBastian says Delta\u2019s immediate goal is, \u201cprotecting the welfare, the well being and the future of our customers, our people in these very challenging times.\u201d He acknowledged more needs to be done to restore confidence among the flying public.\u201cWhen you're talking about the virus, it's caused us to revisit the entire mechanism by which we board planes, how we space out on planes, how we clean planes, how we protect ourselves, go through the experience, and the great thing about it, it's working,\u201d he added.Adam Shapiro is co-anchor of Yahoo Finance\u2019s On the Move.J&J exec: Our coronavirus vaccine is aiming for a 70% success rate in trialsRisk firm: 'American is most at risk' of coronavirus default among US airlinesSouthwest warns that revenue could drop as much as 95% in MayDelta shores up liquidity as coronavirus pummels demand, warns of smaller airlineJetBlue Chairman: 'Everybody's working on survival' as coronavirus decimates airlinesTed Cruz: 'We are going to see human lives lost' if coronavirus shutdowns last for monthsJ&J eyes 'imminent' coronavirus vaccine production, aims for a billion doses worldwideFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit"}]}
