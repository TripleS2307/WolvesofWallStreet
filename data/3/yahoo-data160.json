But in an interview with Yahoo Finance, Jared Bernstein, one of Joe Biden\u2019s top economic advisors, laid out the case for the former vice president to the business community.\u201cMany people in the markets are telling me that they look forward to a Biden presidency,\u201d Bernstein, a former chief economist in the White House and a close advisor to the Biden 2020 campaign, said.In Bernstein\u2019s view, Biden\u2019s number one priority will be to get the pandemic under control and implement his plan to rebuild the economy. Rick Newman also asked how the former Vice President is \u201cgoing to affect the investing climate\u201d after 4 years of strong returns.\u2018Trumpian chaos\u2019Bernstein highlighted perhaps the biggest distinction between the two candidates: the uncertainty and instability President Trump has brought to the White House, contrasted with Biden\u2019s steady hand.Democratic nominee Joe Biden arrives to board an airplane headed for a campaign stop in Pennsylvania on Monday. (SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images)\u201cI think that you have to evaluate the impact of Trumpian chaos,\u201d he said, citing trade wars (\u201ca huge negative for globalization\u201d) and \u201cjust lurching economic policies.\u201dIt\u2019s part of Biden\u2019s overall bet in the 2020 election. His candidacy has been built on the idea that voters are hungry for a return to a more stable government after four years of Trump. The proper functioning of capital markets might not make for an engaging tweet, but it\u2019s an example of an issue that the Biden campaign hopes will resonate with voters.During a speech in Pittsburgh on Monday, Biden listed a range of maladies facing the country right now, from race relations to the pandemic to the economy, and said the common thread is \u201can incumbent president who sows chaos rather than providing order.\u201dRepublicans are making the opposite case in many ways. During the recent Republican convention, Trump\u2019s rough edges and unconventional style were readily acknowledged, and often celebrated as part of what\u2019s needed to get results.Story continuesTrump himself is often citing the stock market \u2013 at least on the days it does well \u2013 as reason alone to re-elect him.Bernstein said the investors he talks to \u201cjust can't take the uncertainty.\u201dRECORD HIGH NASDAQ! It would all come crashing down, including your Jobs, Stocks, and 401k\u2019s, if Sleepy Joe ever became President. China and others would own us!!!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 3, 2020New investing opportunities in clean energyBernstein also had a tip for investors: look at the domestic investments Biden is promising to make. \u201cThere are literally trillions of investments in clean and renewable energy,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cWe're going to be doing well by doing good.\u201dBiden\u2019s plan calls for $2 trillion in new clean energy investments, which he says will help \u201cbuild a more resilient, sustainable economy.\u201dGetting \u201ca clean energy sector off and running is something that capital markets care a lot about,\u201d said Bernstein. The Biden plan wouldn\u2019t eliminate jobs from older energy sources but instead focus on the future. \u201cIt hastens the transition out of extractive industries to one that I would argue energy investment is going all by itself,\u201d he said.Trump\u2019s rebuttal on this front almost always involves three words: Green New Deal. Biden has never endorsed the plan championed by progressives like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, though his climate plan does call it a \u201ccrucial framework.\u201dTrump has tweeted about the \u201cBernie/Biden/AOC Green New Deal plan\u201d and his allies say it would destroy millions of jobs.\u2018A big missing market in this country for childcare\u2019Another area Bernstein made sure to highlight is childcare. It may not have as much direct market impact but he says it\u2019s a huge opportunity for the country.\u201cI think that's a huge plus for America \u2013 not just for markets but for everybody else,\u201d he said.Jared Bernstein served as chief economic advisor to Vice President Joe Biden from 2009-2011.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) telegraphed the importance of the issue for Democrats during the Democrats\u2019 recent convention. Her speech was highly anticipated by business leaders during a part of program called \u201ca more perfect economy.\u201dWarren did get in a few digs against corporate America but her speech was largely focused on investments in childcare. \u201cIt\u2019s time to recognize that childcare is part of the basic infrastructure of this nation,\u201d she said.The question of course is how resonant Bernstein\u2019s argument will be with investors after 4 years \u2013 even with all the chaos and a lingering pandemic \u2013 that has seen strong stock market performance.There are signs that Wall Street\u2019s donors are getting on board with Biden, but Trump does have a lead in other areas, like how voters assess his handling of the economy.Ben Werschkul is a producer for Yahoo Finance in Washington, DC.Read more:Why Joe Biden still has \u2018work to do\u2019 to catch up to Trump on the economyBiden's tax plan: Eyes on the 1% and corporations like AmazonTerry McAuliffe on why \u2018business should be happy that Joe Biden is coming in\u2019Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit."}]}
