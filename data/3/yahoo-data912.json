Economists polled by Bloomberg expect a slight rebound to 90.5 from 86.6 in May.\u201cConsumer confidence has held up reasonably well considering the U.S. continues to combat a global pandemic,\u201d Wells Fargo Securities economist Jay Bryson said in a note June 26. \u201cConfidence measured by the Conference Board was down just 46 points in May from its February pre-COVID peak, and at 86.6, confidence is only as low as it was in 2014.\u201dFor some historical context, Bryson explained that during the 2008 recession, confidence plunged a total of 86.6 points to a record low of 25.3. While consumer confidence is holding up well, there are still significant risks ahead, according to Bryson.\u201cWe expect confidence rose a bit in June as states re-opening plans got underway. But, there remains risk of further declines in coming months, particularly amid increasing positive case counts,\u201d Bryson said.HONG KONG, CHINA - 2020/05/11: A FedEx Express courier prepares the numerous packages inside the delivery truck parked on the street.
