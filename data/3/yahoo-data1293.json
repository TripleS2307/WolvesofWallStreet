Luna, which is only available by invitation for now, will run on Amazon\u2019s massive Amazon Web Services cloud platform and be available for PC, Mac, Fire TV, iPad and iPhone (through web-based apps), and Android.Users can request early access to Luna via the service\u2019s website starting now, but Amazon has not said when the service will be widely available. The platform will be broken down into channels starting with the Luna+ and Ubisoft channels. Luna+ will cost $5.99 in early access, though pricing for the Ubisoft channel isn\u2019t yet available.Amazon promises Luna+ will offer gaming at resolutions of up to 1080p running at 60 frames per second, with 4K resolution coming in the future. You\u2019ll also be able to stream on two devices at the same time, meaning that parents won\u2019t have to subscribe to an extra Luna+ account for their kids.Games available through Luna+ include titles like \u201cControl,\u201d \u201cResident Evil VII,\u201d \u201cSonic Mania,\u201d and more. The Ubisoft channel looks particularly stacked with games like \u201cFar Cry 6,\u201d \u201cAssassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla,\u201d and \u201cImmortals Fenyx Rising\u201d all being made available on the service the same day they hit physical and online stores.Amazon has launched its new Luna cloud gaming service, taking on the likes of Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo, and Google for a piece of the $160 billion gaming industry. (Image: Amazon)Amazon is also releasing its own custom controller for the service, aptly named the Luna Controller. The company says the controller will connect directly to the cloud to eliminate latency and ensure players get a 1-to-1 experience similar to what you\u2019d expect from a traditional home console.The benefits of cloud gamingAmazon is also launching its own Luna Controller for the cloud gaming service. (Image: Amazon)Cloud gaming allows gamers to access their favorite titles from nearly any device with an internet connection. It\u2019s long been considered a kind of Holy Grail for gamers, but until the ubiquity of cloud infrastructure like AWS, has been nearly impossible to pull off.Amazon joins a growing number of entries in the cloud gaming space including Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL).Story continuesAmong the three, Microsoft is seen as the odds-on favorite for being the first to make cloud gaming take off as a go-to service. It currently offers its xCloud platform through its Game Pass service for $15.99 per month, and recently acquired Bethesda parent company ZeniMax, bringing franchises like \u201cDoom,\u201d \u201cThe Elder Scrolls,\u201d and \u201cFallout\u201d to the service.Yahoo Finance newsletter.For cloud gaming to take off, though, gamers need access to strong internet connections \u2014 Amazon suggests speeds of at least 10Mbps \u2014 and no data caps, as players would quickly crash through those limits while streaming.Amazon, however, has a secret weapon up its sleeve in the form of its Twitch game streaming service. Twitch, which allows viewers to watch gamers play their favorite games, will be baked directly into Luna. Gamers will be able to open up a game\u2019s launch page and scroll down to see Twitch streamers playing and providing commentary on the same titles.The service is clearly still in its early days since it\u2019s only available to users via invite. But if Amazon can pull it together, it could further entrench itself into the gaming space alongside the likes of Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo.Got a tip?
