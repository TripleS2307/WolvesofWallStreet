SubscribeStocks slid again on Tuesday.After dropping hard on Thursday and Friday last week, the U.S. stock market began a holiday-shortened week on Tuesday on a similarly downbeat note.On Tuesday, all three majors fell with the Nasdaq suffering the largest losses. The tech index dropped 4.1% and officially entered correction territory with its total decline from recent highs hitting 10%. And from the S&P 500\u2019s record closing high last Wednesday, the benchmark index is now off just less than 7%.Over the holiday weekend, the Morning Brief\u2019s inbox filled up with commentary from strategists across Wall Street trying to make sense of how the market went from euphoric record highs to a messy correction in just a few days.Many strategists cited reporting from the Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal \u2014 among other outlets \u2014 who uncovered the role SoftBank played in buying call options on major U.S. tech firms that resulted in their share prices getting rapidly bid up.The short outline of this story is that aggressive bets by SoftBank that the share price of stocks like Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA) \u2014 stocks the firm held positions in according to a filing in August \u2014 would rise created forced buyers on the way up and forced sellers on the way down.Though as Mike Wilson, an equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, said in a note Tuesday, the \u201cselloff was technical, the trigger was not.\u201dIn other words, while SoftBank may have warped the options market into an offsides situation where forced buyers and forced sellers of stocks created synthetic volatility, the economic backdrop for this decline backs up a case for lower stock prices.\u201cMost are aware of the significant call buying that led to the August rally and last week\u2019s sharp decline in tech stocks,\u201d Wilson writes. \u201cWe think the trigger was fundamental in nature as the market began to contemplate higher back end rates as fiscal stimulus passes, the economy continues to reopen, and the election is decided.\u201dStory continuesWilson sees the combination of further progress on a vaccine, the election, stimulus, avoiding additional shutdowns in the U.S. economy, as well as the Fed\u2019s new inflation framework as setting the market up for higher Treasury yields. And coming off a summer in which earnings revisions and a re-rating of the market\u2019s multiple higher boosted stock prices, higher rates could challenge the valuation picture.The quick reversal in the market\u2019s fortune last week also had some investors contemplating a tech bubble-like change in the market, especially with the center of this stress coming from stocks leading the tech sector. But Oliver Jones, a strategist at Capital Economics, is not at all convinced of this thesis.\u201cEven if we see further bouts of volatility in the big tech stocks in the coming weeks, we would not interpret this as a sign that a major dot com-style tech bubble is about to burst and drag the rest of the market down with it, for two key reasons,\u201d Jones writes.\u201cFirst...a significant chunk of the outperformance of big tech firms has been driven by fundamentals. While options market shenanigans may have contributed a bit lately, the main catalyst for their rally is simply the fact that their businesses have done extremely well, in both absolute and relative terms, during the coronavirus crisis. That has not changed in the past week.\u201cSecond, in contrast to the dot com era, investors are fairly downbeat about almost everything outside of big tech,\u201d Jones adds, citing volume in options connected to the broader indices which suggest investors remain focus on protecting themselves should we endure a prolonged market selloff rather than throwing caution to the wind.In short, the only similarity between this last few days\u2019 decline and the tech bubble is that tech stocks are involved.Over at JPMorgan, strategists John Normand and Federico Manicardi note that the importance of big tech in this rally creates a scenario where this selloff gets even more attention that you might otherwise expect investors to pay to a ~7% drop in the S&P.\u201cThe past few days\u2019 drop in global equities is the third, mild correction since global markets bottomed in late March,\u201d Normand and Manicardi write, \u201cbut it will probably animate more discussions than previous episodes for one reason: the epicenter of Big Tech represents the greatest concentration issue that either Equity or Credit markets have faced in 50 years.\u201d\u201cIn constructing a risk scenario for this sector, which would have huge consequences for country and currency allocations in global portfolios, it is easy to envision the elements of the most perfect storm,\u201d they add.\u201cThese would include: higher interest rates that harm long-duration assets; a vaccine-driven reversal of the work-from-home fixation; and a regulatory response ranging from the relatively routine (fines) to the more existential (constraints on business practices, break-up). All are possible over a long horizon and under certain Washington regimes, but the trifecta doesn\u2019t seem likely under the policy mix proposed by either a second Trump term or a first Biden.\u201dIn these outlines, then, it seems that while most strategists on Wall Street will have their own lens through which to explain the market narrative du jour, how to think about the current moment has a few key through-lines.The concentration of gains and focus on tech made this market more fragile. A backup in Treasury yields might change some key assumptions about equity valuations. But scenarios for sustained downside in the market remain outside consensus frameworks right now.\u201cWe remain quite constructive on this new bull market,\u201d Wilson writes. \u201cHowever, it will likely be harder to make money from here if one is simply long [the S&P 500] or [the Nasdaq].\u201dBy Myles Udland, reporter and co-anchor of The Final Round.
