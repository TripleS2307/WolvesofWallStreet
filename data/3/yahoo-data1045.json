Its stock drifted above $370 in midmorning dealings.However, at least a few analysts are reiterating the stock is still a buy, and see more upside to at least $500.\u201cI came away impressed with the new battery cell that they unveiled, which essentially has six times the power of the current cell, and also their plan to reduce battery costs on a dollar per kilowatt hour basis by about 56%,\u201d Garrett Nelson, CFRA senior equity analyst, told Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cThe First Trade\u201d on Wednesday.Nelson noted massive hype leading up to Battery Day may have left investors wanting more of an immediate catalyst. Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk \u201cdidn't specifically use the term million mile battery as many analysts were expecting,\u201d said Nelson.In fact, Musk\u2019s announcement promising to bring to market a $25,000 fully electric and autonomous vehicle in three years may have actually turned off some investors.\u201cWe don't necessarily think investors want them to lower [the] price,\u201d said Nelson.\u201cInstead we think a lot of investors are hoping that their electric and autonomous technology innovations really make Tesla vehicles kind of a must have product that consumers really have to have \u2014 and that drives pricing power in the marketplace,\u201d he added.Duesseldorf, Germany- December 10. 2019: A red Tesla Model S is parked in a business destrict of Duesseldorf and is connected with a blue power chord to a recharging station, a modern office buidling in the background.In the wake of Battery Day, Deutsche Bank also upped its Tesla price target to $500, moving from \u201cHold\u201d to \u201cBuy.\u201d The bank\u2019s analysts said that \u201cwhile investor expectations into the event were high, Tesla\u2019s plan to achieve 56% reduction in battery cost over the next 3 years came in considerably better than anticipated, and could materially boost its volume and margin outlook.\u201dBank of America called the event \u201cconstructive,\u201d but maintained a \u201cNeutral\u201d rating with a price target of $550. \u201cNews flow from the event was positive as expected, but we believe is unlikely to drive a material short-term move in the stock, given already significant hype behind the company,\u201d BofA wrote on Wednesday.Story continuesNelson predicted that Tesla\u2019s Battery Day announcements will prove to be a longer term positive for the company. He argued the vehicles are the best in the market in terms of price versus range (which is crucial for EV buyers.)\u201cTesla just has a superior product. And coming out with this new, much improved, cheaper battery will help widen their competitive advantage versus peers,\u201d said NelsonUpcoming competition from traditional auto manufacturers like Ford (F) and GM (GM) will struggle to keep up, says Nelson.\u201cEveryone else is just trying to play catch up with Tesla,\u201d said Nelson.Get the advanced data and expert fundamental analysis you can trust with Yahoo Finance Premium.
