The jobless rate also tumbled to 11.1%, with more dislocated workers being absorbed by the ravaged labor market.Now, the bad news: The data was a partial snapshot of the labor market, mostly captured in mid-June \u2014 right before a new wave of COVID-19 infections began ricocheting across the world\u2019s largest economy, which are threatening a return to lockdowns that have been progressively unwound.And despite two months of seven-digit job creation, those aren\u2019t enough to counteract the staggering numbers of jobless workers still in limbo.In fact, the more compelling story could be found in weekly unemployment data, released simultaneously with the non-farm payrolls report that showed over 19 million continuing claims.Since the coronavirus became a byword for economic decimation, nearly 50 million have filed for unemployment benefits. To date, over 30 million of them remain without jobs, economists pointed out on Thursday.European banking giant ING succinctly summarized the dynamic using the title of a song from iconic 80s rap group Public Enemy: \u201cDon\u2019t believe the hype.\u201dJune\u2019s blowout jobs report was \u201cgreat news, but it doesn't tell the whole story. 31.5mn people are claiming unemployment benefits and employment is still 15 million lower than February,\u201d wrote James Knightley, ING\u2019s chief international economist.\u201cMoreover, with states dialing back on re-openings the July jobs report could be far more sobering,\u201d he added.\u2018Maybe save the fireworks\u2019Amanda Agati, PNC Bank\u2019s chief investment strategist, told Yahoo Finance in an interview that millions of jobless claimants were a \u201creally worrisome\u201d sign.Cases are surging in the southern part of the U.S. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)\u201cIt reinforces the point the jobs information and data doesn't jibe with a V-shaped recovery\u201d that many in the market have hoped for, she added.Story continuesIt also raises the risk that July\u2019s report will be a letdown \u2014 especially with COVID-19\u2019s stubborn refusal to fade away.\u201cA month ago we were in a much better place... maybe save the fireworks for the July report,\u201d Agati quipped.Sun Belt states that include Florida, California and Texas \u2014 some of the most populous regions in the country \u2014 are now reimposing restrictions on citizens after lifting them. That poses considerable peril to bars and restaurants that were decimated by the first wave of mass lockdowns.\u201cThe virus\u2019 second wave (or stubborn first wave) has raised doubts as to whether this can be sustained,\u201d said Michael Feroli, economist at JPMorgan Chase, who said those questions were reinforced by the higher-than-expected jobless claims.\u201cThis occurred as PPP [Payroll Protection Program] funds began running dry in the second half of June (mostly after the reference week for the June employment report),\u201d he said, adding that there were downside risks to the bank\u2019s estimates for 12% growth in the second half of the year.According to some, a run of better-than-expected data \u2014 which includes a monster rebound in retail sales in an economy composed of 70% consumer spending \u2014 is also raising concerns that the federal government will pull back on fiscal stimulus.The major concern is that the headlines will lead some to conclude that it is time to close the door or pull back aid to those out of work,\u201d said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM.\u201cIn our estimation that would be a serious policy error that would put in jeopardy a nascent recovery that we think is in play,\u201d he said. Brusuelas added that additional unemployment payments set to expire at the end of July may result in \u201ca sharp decline in household consumption in late summer and early fall, just before the November U.S. election.\u201dPresident Donald Trump\u2019s electoral fortunes hinge on whether the economy can pull off a death-defying recovery before November \u2014 one reason why he\u2019s called for a new round of bigger, direct payments to consumers.However, at least some analysts warned that a sharp recovery is far from certain.\u201cNo doubt the administration will be crowing about today\u2019s numbers, but they\u2019d better make the most of them; the July and August numbers won\u2019t be as good; at this point, we can\u2019t rule out a decline in payrolls,\u201d wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit."}]}
