But I can tell you that the demand literally spiked for me. My team has been kept absolutely busy,\u201d Kholkar told Yahoo Finance recently.Discussions about the future of the workforce \u2014 mostly structured around commuting to and from offices \u2014 have been on the table for some time.However, a pace that was once gradual has now hit the fast lane, as the pandemic prompts more employers to extend generous remote working arrangements. Indian tech executives have found themselves navigating a changed landscape that\u2019s forced a broad rethinking about work visas and technological change.Ravi Kumar S., Infosys\u2019 (INFY) president, told Yahoo Finance\u2019s All Markets Summit last month that many tech firms such as his are among those looking to move to more remote work.\u201cMany CIOs I've spoken to, many tech companies I've spoken to, have told me that maybe 50% of the workforce is never going to come back to work,\u201d Infosys\u2019s Kumar said.Facebook (FB) has already suggested as much \u2014 and that salaries could change based on the cost of living where employees choose to live.However, the shift is coming much faster than many anticipated \u2014 even with the onset of the pandemic.\u201cWhat I thought [was] that things would actually slow down and people might actually say, \u2018Let\u2019s wait, let\u2019s see how things shape up,\u2019\u201d Tata\u2019s Kholkar said.\u201cBut what surprised me was the fact that they actually accelerated. We realized that it was a matter of survival for many of them,\u201d he added.Story continues\u201cThe openness from customers to do things remotely has been a big revelation for me, personally. I used to travel almost 20 days a month trying to meet customers on deals or just for discussions. It always used to be effective face-to-face,\u201d the executive said.To respond to the outbreak, TCS didn\u2019t have to hire additional labor. Because some lines of business were down, existing employees were shifted to the projects to support companies racing into remote working.In addition, newly graduated students joining the company helped boost the labor force, Kholkar said.Pushing toward the futureDespite some concerns that productivity would take a hit \u2014 and that some industries wouldn\u2019t adapt well to having employees in far-flung places, the new normal merged with trends that were already well under way.Even in the face of growing nationalism worldwide, some economists believe the post-COVID-19 era will be defined by tighter links through technology worldwide. In a virtual discussion on Thursday, Dr. Kaushik Basu, an international studies professor at Cornell University and INET Commission on Global Economic Transformation said that \u201cdigital globalization is going to grow\u201d regardless of populist waves sweeping politics.Basu also warned that world\u2019s leaders need to avoid going \u201cthe dinosaur route\u201d by rejecting technological trends, even as they manage the growing dominance of bigger players.Kumar S. said last month that companies had already been looking to rely more on technology, and that artificial intelligence (AI) has pivoted to proactive problem hunting, rather than reactive problem solving.Wipro (WIT) chief technology officer K.R. Sanjiv told Yahoo Finance in an interview that the company is plowing more investment into next-generation technologies \u201cthat will mature or become mainstream in a two-to-four year time period.\u201dThat includes AI, autonomous driving, industrial robotics, 5G technology, and augmented and virtual reality. Those are all areas where the company is spending 60% to 70% of its budget and efforts, Sanjiv said.Wipro and its competitors have also been in a race to file patents and secure intellectual property rights. The company\u2019s employees are compensated per patent filing, and are additionally financially rewarded for any patents which are successful.In the U.S., Wipro is near the top, filing at least 100 patents in 2019, and more than 300 in the past three years, according to the U.S. Patent Office. Sanjiv said the company files at least 400 to 500 patents a year overall.By comparison, TCS has filed nearly 400 in the past three years, and almost 100 in 2019.KENOSHA, WI - APRIL 18: President Donald Trump speaks to workers at the headquarters of tool manufacturer Snap-On on April 18, 2017 in Kenosha, Wisconsin. During the visit, Trump signed an executive order to try to bring jobs back to American workers and revamp the H-1B visa guest worker program. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)H1-B concernsYet with a workforce that can now be physically located anywhere, concerns have now bubbled up about the future of talent from abroad.Among some Indian companies, H-1B visa fears are once again top-of-mind, even after they increased their onshore operations and labor pool to appease a Trump administration that\u2019s moved to tighten controls on immigration, even for students.\u201cA lot of firms have been building out senior leadership in the U.S. for a decade,\u201d according to Richard Rossow, Wadhwani Chair in U.S.-India Policy Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).Kholkar said the recent H-1B executive order halting all new visas is affecting \u201cevery company that does business in the U.S.\u201d Still, companies like TCS, Infosys and Wipro have spent the last few years opening up corporate campuses and engaging with colleges and universities to hire more U.S. residents.But it also helps the company push forward on plans it already had to expand into smaller cities in India to ramp up its talent pool, Kholkar said.\u201cWe\u2019ve been largely focused on the cities, the main metros. We had started on the Tier 2 journey \u2014Gandhinagar, Indore, Bhuvaneshwar, Nagpur\u201d all of which can accelerate now, he said, adding it will help the company source talent on-demand.\u201cThat will potentially change the entire game,\u201d Kholkar said.Anjalee Khemlani is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
