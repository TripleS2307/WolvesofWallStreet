The Dow eked out a modest rise after briefly dipping during intraday trading.[Click here to read what\u2019s moving markets heading into Wednesday, September 16] Equities mostly poised extended gains from Monday, when each of the three major indices closed more than 1% higher, and the Nasdaq rose for the first time in three sessions. Apple (AAPL) shares pared earlier gains and then fell, after company held a virtual product launch event Tuesday afternoon focused on the Apple Watch and iPad. The communications sector was the best-performer in the S&P 500, followed closely by real estate and information technology.\u201cLast week was rough. I think markets are at a crossroad since we\u2019ve gained so much since March. And the economic data\u2019s been better, the health data has been encouraging, since cases are falling. But from a markets perspective, nothing is really decisive,\u201d Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, told Yahoo Finance\u2019s The Ticker on Monday.\u201cI think investor are still torn, and I think that\u2019s why they\u2019re sticking with these tech stocks,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think tech needs to roll over for cyclicals to work. I think for cyclicals to work, investors just need to be confidence that the good news on the economy is continuing. And then the cash comes off the sidelines and the sentiment which was really bearish turns positive, and I think that\u2019s what fuels the rally into year-end.\u201dBetter-than-expected economic data out of China overnight helped boost contracts on US stock indices and global equities, as signs that the economy first hit by the coronavirus pandemic was bouncing back at a faster than anticipated clip. China\u2019s retail sales rose in August by 0.5% year-over-year, marking the first increase so far this year and topping expectations for a flat reading. Industrial production increased 5.6% in August over last year, versus a 5.1% rise expected.Story continuesA slew of new deal-making activity helped contribute to a more risk-on session in markets. Nvidia announced the largest-ever chip industry deal to purchase SoftBank\u2019s Arm unit, Gilead (GILD) unveiled its intent to purchase tumor-fighting drug-developer Immunomedics (IMMU) and Oracle (ORCL) confirmed it was in the running to become a \u201ctrusted technology provider\u201d to ByteDance\u2019s TikTok, edging out Microsoft (MSFT) for a tie-up with the fast-growing social media platform. Oracle \u2013 which will still need to undergo a US national security review and win approval from President Donald Trump for its partnership with TikTok to come to fruition \u2013 saw shares trade slightly lower in late trading, after closing 4.3% higher earlier in the day.Tuesday will also mark the first of two days of meetings for the Federal Open Market Committee. The Federal Reserve will release its September monetary policy statement Wednesday afternoon, followed by a press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Both the statement and remarks are expected to reaffirm policymakers\u2019 cautious tone on economic growth during the pandemic, and potentially lay the groundwork for more specifics on the central bank\u2019s plan for forward guidance, following its newly announced policy framework around inflation announced at its annual symposium in late August.\u201cGiven we just got a significant update from Fed Chair Powell at the annual Jackson Hole Symposium, the upcoming meeting should garner much less fanfare than usual,\u201d RBC Capital Markets economists wrote in a note Friday. \u201cMost of what Powell touched on at Jackson Hole was very forward-guidance driven. So we will hear about 1) more willingness to let inflation run above 2% (the inflation averaging provisions) and 2) letting the unemployment rate drift well below the natural rate in the future (the de-linking of employment and inflation that Powell promoted).\u201d\u201cFrom our lens the recent tweaks are merely a concretization of an already active process,\u201d they added.\u20144:11 p.m. ET: Stocks end higher, Nasdaq posts back-to-back sessions of gainsHere were the main moves in markets as of 4:11 p.m. ET:S&P 500 (^GSPC): +17.66 (+0.52%) to 3,401.20Dow (^DJI): +2.27 (+0.01%) to 27,995.60Nasdaq (^IXIC): +133.67 (+1.21%) to 11,190.32Crude (CL=F): +$1.04 (+2.79%) to $38.30 a barrelGold (GC=F): -$2.10 (-0.11%) to $1,961.60 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): +0.8 bps to yield 0.6790%\u20142:00 p.m. ET: Apple unveils new Apple Watch, iPads, at event TuesdayApple held a product launch event Tuesday focused on launching new versions of its Apple Watch and iPad, along with Apple One, a subscription bundle including iCloud, Music, TV+, Arcade and Fitness+.The new Apple Watch Series 6 will include blood oxygen monitors and a faster processor, and will begin at $399.
