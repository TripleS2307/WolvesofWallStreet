According to Frank CEO Charlie Javice, their new portal was immediately hit with unprecedented demand.\u201cIn about 10 hours we got over 10,000 applications submitted,\u201d she told Yahoo Finance\u2019s YFi PM. \u201cStudents could be eligible for anywhere from $500 to up to $5,000 of aid.\u201dThe rules for distribution of the aid, referred to as the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund, (HEERF) have been changing since the program was launched. A judge recently blocked prior Department of Education guidance that attempted to limit eligibility to Title-IV students who were on financial aid. Now, colleges have more leeway to distribute aid, and in some cases have been prioritizing students who had filed a FAFSA or federal student loan application though that is no longer necessary to receive aid.\u201cThere are different eligibility requirements,\u201d Javice said, adding that in order to maximize direct aid students may need to provide proof of either job loss or reduced hours or eligible expenses tied to food or travel that stemmed from coronavirus hardships. Beyond that, much of the onus falls on colleges to inform students of the aid and distribute it to students in need \u2014 something colleges have failed in large part to do so far, Javice said.(Jordan Strauss/AP Images for University of California, Irvine)\u201cAll in all, our colleges and the Department of Education have really not helped students. They\u2019ve really confused them,\u201d she said. \u201cIf anything it\u2019s probably as backward and worse than the [Small Business Administration\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program] that we saw and experienced personally as a company.\u201dStory continuesWhile the SBA\u2019s program ran into funding issues and had to be refunded by Congress after businesses quickly applied for grants, it seems as though the Higher Education Relief Fund is suffering the opposite problem at least for the time being. As Javice explains, however, aid is similarly on a first-come-first-served-basis for eligible students.Notably, some schools have turned down aid that had been allocated as part of Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. Harvard University, for example, announced it would not accept HEERF funds after the school came under fire following attacks by President Trump, who erroneously claimed the school had sought out relief funds. The school released a statement denying that it had applied for or sought any funding, but said it would proactively turn down the funding that the Department of Education had allocated. Some other larger institutions followed suit, with promises that students would still be made whole for any similar coronavirus-related expenses.Zack Guzman is the host of YFi PM as well as a senior writer and on-air reporter covering entrepreneurship, cannabis, startups, and breaking news at Yahoo Finance.
