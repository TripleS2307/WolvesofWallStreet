President Trump narrowly won the state in 2016 and now Democrats are trying to take it back. The Democratic National Committee originally planned to host its convention in Milwaukee, before deciding to go virtual because of the COVID-19 pandemic.One of the most important industries to the state\u2019s economy is dairy farming. The industry has struggled over the past several years and the COVID-19 pandemic has introduced a whole new set of challenges. In the beginning of the pandemic, dairy farmers were dumping milk as restaurant and school shutdowns killed food-service demand.Mitch Breunig owns Mystic Valley Dairy in Sauk City, Wisc. He told Yahoo Finance he currently milks about 400 cows and has 1,000 acres of cropland. He said things really started to change in April.\u201cWe actually sold some cows to some other farmers and then we actually, in the end, had to dump some milk out. That was pretty frustrating. In my lifetime, I don\u2019t ever remember having to do that,\u201d said Breunig.Breunig said the pandemic revealed that the U.S. supply chain was broken.\u201cIt just backed that whole system up. It took probably 60 days for that to sort of get back in balance and realign itself, but during that time, it was really hard. Having cows \u2014 it isn\u2019t like we just flip a switch or turn them on and off,\u201d said Breunig. \u201cInstead of living day by day, we almost lived hour by hour waiting for the next shoe to drop.\u201dCAMBRIDGE, WI - APRIL 25: Cows eat before being milked on Hinchley's Dairy Farm on April 25, 2017 near Cambridge, Wisconsin.

Breunig, who is also a corn and soybean farmer, said President Trump\u2019s trade war with China and other trade negotiations have also disrupted his work and hit his business.\u201cThe trade deals have really been a problem to me because trade isn\u2019t something you do overnight. It\u2019s relationships that are built over time,\u201d said Breunig. \u201cWhen you start manipulating those markets, it really starts to, you know, sort of screw up the supply chain. We\u2019ve done a lot to screw up our supply chain in the last couple years.\u201dStory continuesBreunig hasn\u2019t decided who he\u2019ll vote for in the presidential race, but said trade and agriculture policy will be major factors as he makes his choice. President Trump touts the newly negotiated NAFTA, now the United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA), and the China trade deal while campaigning \u2014 but Breunig told Yahoo Finance he was hoping for more.\u201cWe\u2019ve signed some deals, but we haven\u2019t really seen the fruits of those labors and, to me, it\u2019s been disappointing,\u201d said Breunig. \u201cWe have this fancy new deal, but the meat and potatoes that are inside the deal are really what\u2019s important and we really haven\u2019t seen those come forward yet.\u201dJessica Smith is a reporter for Yahoo Finance based in Washington, D.C.
