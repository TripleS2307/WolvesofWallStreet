Throughout the outbreak, her firm has doled out free financial advice and coaching for women, encouraging them to invest more.She explained to Yahoo Finance that the pandemic \u2014 which is impacting workers at all income levels \u2014 is exacerbating unfavorable socioeconomic and gender trends.\u201cWe talk a lot about the gender pay gap \u2014 82 cents [for a woman] to a white man\u2019s dollar,\u201d she said last week. \u201cThe gender wealth gap, so, how much women have, is 32 cents to a white man\u2019s dollar. For black women, it\u2019s a single penny. And we\u2019re going backwards in the pandemic.\u201dAccording to a new poll from Harris and Yahoo Finance, women feel far less confident about hitting their investing goals than men. Only 4% of women surveyed feel \u201cvery confident,\u201d compared to 32% of men, while 47% reported feeling \u201cfairly confident\u201d versus 60% of male respondents.What\u2019s more, as the COVID-19 pandemic wrecked the economy, women \u2014 particularly females of color \u2014 have been disproportionately affected by job losses. Krawcheck noted that even women who are privileged enough to work remotely from home are less productive, as they take on a bulk of responsibilities in the household.Krawcheck recently pivoted the business to offer more solutions targeted toward women and non-binary investors. In June, Ellevest debuted its $1 monthly Money Membership, that provides one-on-one financial and career coaching as well as saving and budgeting tools.There\u2019s an executive-level membership for $9 per month. Ellevest also rolled out checking account and no-fee debit card options, with an automatic roundup to build savings.However \u2014 Krawcheck, who served in the c-suite at Citigroup (C) and Merrill Lynch (BAC), doesn\u2019t view traditional banks as her competition.Story continues\u201cOur competition is inertia and not taking action. In particular, because women receive so many negative messages around money \u2014 including that they\u2019re not as good at managing cash, or investing.\u201c\u2018You\u2019re not good at math. You\u2019re not great at investing. You need more financial education. You\u2019re risk-averse,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThe only one that\u2019s true is everybody needs more financial education.\u201dJulia La Roche is a Correspondent for Yahoo Finance.
