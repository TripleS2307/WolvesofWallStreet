This week's Tech Support tip:How to save on your monthly cable bill:If you\u2019re a cable TV subscriber, you\u2019re probably looking for ways to lower your bill. After all, at least three different firms including Comcast (CMCSA), Charter (CHTR), and Optimum (ATUS) have increased their prices this year.Yahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley doesn't spend more than he has to on cable.

But now there are services like Netflix (NFLX), and Hulu (DIS), and Prime Video (AMZN), and, well you get the picture.DVRs in the age of streaming are unnecessary. And if you\u2019re dropping the extra cash on a DVR, I\u2019m going to assume you\u2019ve also got at least one streaming subscription.With DVRs priced at anywhere from $9.99 to $29.99 per month depending on your cable provider, you\u2019re bleeding your pockets dry for something that\u2019s more or less obsolete at this point. If you\u2019re really trying to save, kick that DVR to the curb.Get rid of all of those extra channelsThe ability to choose from 200 channels sounds great in theory, but you\u2019re probably not taking advantage of all of those options. You likely got roped into your over-the-top plan in the first place because it was the only way to watch that one channel you really like: the adult contemporary music channel.If you\u2019re trying to save, there\u2019s no reason to spend all of that extra money each month on a single channel. But before you ditch your favorite channel, start by asking your provider to lop off any premium channels from your subscription. That should help reduce your monthly bill. And if it\u2019s not enough, slim down your channel package to something more reasonable, even if it means no adult contemporary music channel.Story continuesSend back those extra cable boxesSo you\u2019ve got TVs in the living room, bedroom, and your kids\u2019 rooms, and they\u2019ve all got cable boxes attached. That, dear reader, is a huge waste of money. Each of those cable boxes is a drain on your wallet when each box costs as much as $10 a month.Ditching even one of those boxes will save you roughly $120 a year in fees. And it only goes up from there. Sure, you\u2019re not going to be able to access every single channel from every TV in your home, but the savings are worth it. You\u2019ll likely still need at least one box in your home to ensure you can access certain channels \u2014 but I\u2019ll take $10 a month for a single box versus $40 a month for four boxes any day.Try negotiatingMost people know the old trick to lower your cable bill: Threaten to cancel. That tactic used to work, but increasingly, cable companies are letting customers walk away when they threaten to cancel their subscriptions.But that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t at least try to negotiate a better rate. That\u2019s especially true if you\u2019re paying a good deal for your service. Customers on entry-level plans are more likely to be told there\u2019s no wiggle room for them, while those on pricey plans may be able to knock off a few bucks if they make the ask.Just stream itBetween Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, and Disney+, there\u2019s more than enough streaming content to keep you occupied until the heat death of the Sun. Really, the only reason to have a cable TV subscription is for live sports, and even those are available through subscription services.If live TV is a necessity, you can always subscribe to over-the-top cable options like YouTube TV or Sling. And if you just want to watch your local broadcast stations, your best bet is to simply purchase an over-the-air antenna.Follow these steps, and you\u2019re all but certain to save on your next bill. And isn\u2019t that all anyone wants?Got a tip?
