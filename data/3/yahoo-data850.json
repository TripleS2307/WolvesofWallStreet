Weekly initial jobless claims have decelerated for 10 consecutive weeks. The prior week\u2019s figure was revised higher to 1.897 million from the previously reported 1.88 million. Over the past 3 months, more than 44 million Americans have filed for unemployment insurance.Read more: Coronavirus: How to find a job in a tough economy(Yahoo Finance/David Foster)Continuing claims, which lags initial jobless claims data by one week, totaled 20.93 million in the week ending May 30 following 21.27 million in the prior week. Consensus expectations were for 20 million continuing claims.\u201cInitial jobless claims continued the gradual downward trend,\u201d Capital Economics wrote in a note Thursday. \u201cBut it is still hard to square the claims figures with the much more upbeat news on the labour market from May\u2019s Employment Report.\u201d\u201cWe suspect that claims look overly pessimistic because the massive boost to the value and duration of unemployment benefits and the relaxation of eligibility criteria have encouraged a much greater than normal proportion of the jobless to put in an application. Nevertheless, despite the discrepancy between the two measures, both tell the same broad story of a still near-unprecedented level of joblessness,\u201d the firm added.In the week ending June 6, California reported the highest number of jobless claims at an estimated 258,000 on an unadjusted basis, up from 229,000 in the previous week. Georgia had 136,000, down from 149,000. Florida reported 111,000 and New York had roughly 94,000 jobless claims.Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program claims, which include those who were previously ineligible for unemployment insurance such as self-employed and contracted workers, was closely monitored in Thursday\u2019s report.Story continuesPUA claims totaled 705,676 on an unadjusted basis in the week ending June 6, down from the prior week\u2019s 796,813.\u201cA persistent decline in the PUA claims as we\u2019ve seen in the regular claims data would further increase our conviction in the labor market stabilization and suggest processing backlogs have been cleared. Similarly, stabilization in PUA continuing claims would signal re-employment for gig workers, but this is not our base case in next week's report.\u201dThis week\u2019s initial jobless claims data comes after the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the U.S. economy unexpectedly added 2.5 million nonfarm payrolls in May, exceeding economists expectations for 7.5 million job losses. The unemployment rate fell to 13.3% from 14.7% in April.\u2014Heidi Chung is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
