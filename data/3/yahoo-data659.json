Nearly all of Nike\u2019s locations were open across North America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), and Greater China during the quarter.Both Nike\u2019s Greater China and EMEA regions saw quarterly revenue increase over last year, by 8% and 5%, respectively. But revenue from North America \u2013 the company\u2019s largest segment \u2013 dropped again in the first quarter by 1%, as more than 20% declines in apparel and equipment sales outweighed a return to growth in footwear.But across regions, even as stores reopen, Nike noted that it still continues to experience \u201cyear-over-year declines in physical retail traffic across the marketplace due to COVID-19 impacts and safety-related measures.\u201dStory continuesNike\u2019s most recently quarterly performance marked a stark contrast from its fiscal fourth quarter through May, when nearly 90% of Nike-owned stores outside of Greater China were closed for eight weeks during the quarter and \u201csignificantly impacting\u201d those period\u2019s results. Nike last quarter had swung to its first quarterly loss in two years as net losses totaled $790 million.For its fiscal fourth quarter, however, net income came in at $1.5 billion, pushing the company well above breakeven and representing growth of 11% over last year, with lower selling and administrative expenses offsetting a decline in gross margins, which came as the company leaned on promotions to move through excess inventory. Revenue of $10.59 billion ticked down less than 1% over last year, improving after a 38% drop in the fourth quarter.\u2014Emily McCormick is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.
