All employees were safe, the company said, but several mills temporarily cut back their shifts.That\u2019s the second natural disaster to rock the industry in 2020. In March, producers idled sawmills during the coronavirus lockdown. Just a month later, pent-up demand exploded. Homebuilders broke ground on a surprising number of new houses, and do-it-yourselfers, fortified by government stimulus checks, took on home repairs and remodeling jobs they were able to tackle while under quarantine.In the wake of that volatility, futures have climbed 57% this year, and even after falling from a record high last month, prices are still on pace for the largest gain since 1993.\u201cEveryone stopped and took a breath right after Covid hit to see what the supply-demand constraints were going to look like,\u201d said Joe Sanderson, managing director of natural resources at Domain Timber Advisers LLC, which owns or invests in 283,000 acres in various locations around the country. \u201cBased on all the activity related to people fixing up their decks, or building a new addition on their house, we\u2019ve seen that demand pick back up.\u201dNow lethal wildfires look like they\u2019re about to have an impact on the industry. Logging bans, closed railroad lines and shuttered mills in the Pacific Northwest have added tension to what Kevin Mason, managing director at ERA Forest Products Research in Kelowna, British Columbia, calls \u201can incredibly tight supply chain.\u201dIn more normal times, some customers would pad their inventories on concerns that commercial timberlands could go up in smoke. But that\u2019s impossible now due to a supply shortage.Story continues\u201cWe\u2019re in an unprecedented market,\u201d Mason said. \u201cThere\u2019s no flood of supply and no reduction in demand.\u201dMason said lumber prices will dip in the fourth quarter, but come back strong in 2021, boosted by another wave of demand, delayed in part by the current shortage. Last month, futures reached an all-time high of $830.90 per 1,000 board feet. The current price, $640, is still 68% higher than the average over the last five years.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you see some of the mills struggling to keep the log supply in front of the mills,\u201d Devin Stockfish, Weyerhaeuser\u2019s chief executive officer, said during a virtual conference presentation Monday.Read more: Millions of Beetles Are Wiping Out Forests All Across the WorldWith supply and demand so haywire, volatility has soared. Consider Weyerhaeuser\u2019s performance. Shares lost more than half their value in March, only to make it all back by the end of July.Lumber\u2019s price swings have rippled across the country. Boosted by higher material costs, the average new single-family home sells for $16,148 more in August than it did in mid-April, according to the National Association of Home Builders. The average price of a new multifamily home has increased by $6,107 over the same period.\u201cHousing has been a bright spot, if not the bright spot, for the overall economy in recent months,\u201d said Robert Dietz, chief economist for the homebuilders\u2019 group.Strong DemandDemand remains strong. In July, U.S. new-home sales jumped to the highest in nearly 14 years, buoyed by a reported urban exodus to the suburbs and historically low mortgage-interest rates. At Home Depot Inc., a supplier to weekend carpenters, lumber was the best-performing department in the second quarter, according to Ted Decker, the retailer\u2019s executive vice president of merchandising.Other construction data show what a roller-coaster year it\u2019s been. In January, builders broke ground on the most new homes since 2006, before the Great Recession. By April, that number had plunged 42%. At the end of July, it was back to flirting with the 14-year high.Still, economic pressures lurk on the horizon. Direct U.S. government stimulus to taxpayers has run out, joblessness remains high and the two natural disasters -- wildfires in the West and the spread of coronavirus most rampant in the South and Midwest -- remain out of control.\u201cA lot of us wonder how long can the demand for home purchases be this strong without a more meaningful recovery in the labor market or the broader economy,\u201d said Richard Moody, chief economist at Regions Financial Corp. in Birmingham, Alabama.Mark Wilde, a senior analyst at BMO Capital Markets in New York, said he\u2019s been involved with the lumber market for 30 years and has never seen anything like what\u2019s been happening in 2020.\u201cThis has been pretty singular in terms of volatility,\u201d he said.(Adds company comments starting in second paragraph, updates prices in fourth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."}]}
