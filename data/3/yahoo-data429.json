Twitter reacted by blocking further posts from all verified accounts on the service and said it had detected \u201ca coordinated social engineering attack by people who successfully targeted some of our employees with access to internal systems and tools.\u201dThe company\u2019s explanation has ignited speculation over the identity of the perpetrators and what they were actually targeting in the attack. The scale of the endeavor and its timing -- months before the November U.S. elections -- have prompted some cybersecurity experts to theorize that the attack masked a more nefarious campaign to seize sensitive data.In its investigation of the incident, Twitter will now likely focus on employee logs, email and phone records. At question will be any failures in authentication processes that might have allowed hackers to hijack verified accounts, and also what other information, such as direct messages, might have been compromised in the breach. The Bitcoin wallets promoted in the tweets collected around $120,000 in cryptocurrency.Twitter shares were down about 3% Thursday morning in New York.A social engineering attack means \u201cleveraging the human element of security,\u201d and there are many different ways to do that, said Rachel Tobac, chief executive officer of San Francisco-based SocialProof Security.\u201cI can phish someone who has administrative access and try and gain access to their credentials and log into their account,\u201d she said, or the less technical method would be to develop \u201ca relationship with someone who works on those panels and convincing them to do your bidding for you.\u201dStory continuesSecurity awareness at companies like Twitter would be mandatory, but ultimately it\u2019s hard to track insider attacks when it\u2019s the employees rather than the technology who fall under the microscope, Tobac said.\u201cIt used to be the Nigerian prince letter with a bunch of spelling mistakes, and now it\u2019s something that almost looks legitimate, but it always starts with a person,\u201d said Frances Dewing, the CEO of cybersecurity firm Rubica Inc., based in Seattle.\u201cThere\u2019s a playbook for doing this, there are cybercriminal organizations that make millions of dollars. It\u2019s the fastest growing business in the world,\u201d she said.Trump DeactivatedAnd there is no accounting for disaffected workers, as Twitter learned in 2017 when an employee deactivated President Donald Trump\u2019s account before it was quickly restored.Identifying potential Twitter employees to target wouldn\u2019t be difficult for the hackers, given the way most smartphone apps hungrily vacuum up location and other contextual data from users -- data which is often then sold on to marketing companies. Anyone frequenting the same coffee shops and businesses or entering and leaving a workplace at particular hours can give away clues about themselves.Cybersecurity experts can only speculate until Twitter itself reveals what happened and where the failures occurred, but even this kind of show of force -- a demonstration by hackers to earn credibility or gain infamy -- isn\u2019t convincing them that a Bitcoin scam was all there was to the operation.With U.S. elections looming, the cyber landscape is ripe for a major attack. Stas Protassov, co-founder and president of global technology firm Acronis said the attack was \u201ctoo prepared to be just a cryptocurrency scam.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t believe that\u2019s all the hackers went into once they got access,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cThe attack is too big and too noisy and likely covering a bigger play. We\u2019ve yet to see the full impact of what this was about.\u201dLingering EffectsTobac also raised the possibility that the attack could have been a distraction while hackers harvested private direct messages and any other confidential data to be able to deploy at a more critical time. So while the initial disruption to Twitter\u2019s service appears to have been patched over and the company is gradually restoring normal operation, the lingering effects of this breach might have much wider effects than Wednesday\u2019s spectacle.\u201cMaybe they were doing something insidious and this was just a cover-up,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way for us to know, we can just speculate.\u201dWhatever happened, Twitter must be completely candid about the cause of attack once it\u2019s established, Tobac said. \u201cThis was such a public meltdown that if they\u2019re not completely transparent it would damage their brand further.\u201dCostin Raiu, global research and analysis director at Kaspersky, said the methods used in the Twitter attack -- leveraging a certain access to facilitate financial profit -- suggest it was executed by a cybercriminal group and financially motivated. Nation-state hackers, he said, would likely use such access to collect private information.(Adds additional detail in last paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."}]}
