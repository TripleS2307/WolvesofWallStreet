On Saturday, Florida and Texas reported record numbers of daily COVID-19 cases. The West and South have been seeing large spikes in cases over recent weeks. According to the World Health Organization\u2019s latest situation report released Saturday, the number of new COVID-19 cases worldwide hit a new record of 212,326 cases over 24 hours.\u201cThe reopenings have led to a sharp rebound in activity, but new localised Covid-19 outbreaks have cast a renewed cloud over the global economic outlook for the second half of the year,\u201d ING wrote in a report July 2. \u201cCovid-19 infections and hospitalisations are on the rise in many states, leading to fears that the recovery could falter in response to renewed restrictions and consumer caution. In the absence of a vaccine, the Federal government will need to provide more support to keep the economy on the recovery track.\u201dBank of America Securities economists explained that the spread of the virus appeared to be having an effect on economic activity. Looking at Bank of America\u2019s internal card data, total card spending turned lower and is now running at -3.8% year-over-year for the week ending June 27 vs. flat over the prior week in Texas, Georgia and Florida.\u201cThis is likely to the virus spreading at a faster rate in these states. Moreover, these data indicate that the risks of a W shaped recovery are mounting,\u201d the firm wrote in a July 2 note.A couple enters the Oceans Ten restaurant on Ocean Drive on July 04, 2020 in the South Beach neighborhood of Miami Beach, Florida.

It is expected to have risen to a 50.0 from 45.4 in May, according to economists polled by Bloomberg.Though the services sector likely saw a bounce in activity during June due to reopenings, the level still remains well below pre-COVID. \u201cIf the ISM non-manufacturing index for June is also above 50, this would be yet another sign that economic activity bottomed out in April and has been on a steady upward ascent since,\u201d Wells Fargo Securities said in a note July 2.Story continues\u201cThat said, it would not be a sign that activity is back to \u2018normal\u2019 levels, as it will likely take several months, if not years, of steady expansion to recoup the March/April decline. The key concern at this point, in our view, is that the May/June momentum could be halted in July amid a resurgence of the virus in some parts of the United States,\u201d the firm added.Meanwhile, the earnings calendar remains light for the week.
