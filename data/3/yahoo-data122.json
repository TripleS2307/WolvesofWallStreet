They are friends, neighbors, allies. We have been unified for years under NAFTA, I think that it makes a lot of sense for our economy to continue to grow together.\u201dUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo (R) speaks during a press conference with Chinese politburo member Yang Jiechi during the US-China Diplomatic and Security Dialogue in the Benjamin Franklin Room of the State Department in Washington, DC on November 9, 2018.

But the updated pact includes fresh provisions on labor, digital trade, and intellectual property that provides a template for future U.S. trade negotiations, Shaw said.The new labor rules require 40 to 45 percent of auto parts be made by workers earning at least $16 per hour by 2023, comparable to average wages of U.S. workers in the sector. A change in rules of origin provisions for auto parts, increases the threshold from 62.5% to 75%, strengthening the case towards regionalization of global supply chains.On digital trade, the USMCA prohibits forced data localization and bans custom duties on digital products, while preventing discriminatory treatment of cross border data transfers.\u201cUSMCA effectively modernizes NAFTA. There were no provisions on digital trade. There were few provisions on intellectual property, it significantly improved the labor provisions, whereas you know previously there was a concern but you know jobs were going to go south because of cheap labor,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cI think it improves the overall investment environment and creates more certainty.\u201dStory continuesThe USMCA goes into effect as the Trump administration looks to quiet concerns about another trade agreement with China. White House Trade Adviser Peter Navarro rattled markets last week after suggesting the Phase One deal was \u201cover,\u201d before walking back the comments. That proceeded a tense meeting between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and China\u2019s top diplomat Yang Jiechi in Hawaii, where Beijing reportedly agreed to accelerate purchases of U.S. goods and services agreed to under the Phase One deal.U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has maintained the deal is on track, telling the House Ways and Means Committee last month, \u201cEvery indication is that in spite of this COVID-19, they are going to do what they say.\u201d But the U.S.-China relationship has grown increasingly contentious over the last few months, on issues related to the coronavirus and Hong Kong.Shaw said the increased global scrutiny on China, over the lack of transparency around the virus\u2019s origins and the country\u2019s handling in the initial days, provided a potential opening on trade, and Washington\u2019s ability to rally other allies to its side.\u201cCovid woke up a lot of countries to the lack of transparency and accountability with China\u2019s system. I think it\u2019s good that countries are taking a second look and I think it provides an opportunity for more multilateral collaboration on these issues,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cIn the E.U., they\u2019re talking about supply-chain shortening and what they can do to bring manufacturing and some of the production back. It\u2019s an existential question countries around the world are going to be asking for the foreseeable future.\u201dAkiko Fujita is an anchor and reporter for Yahoo Finance.
