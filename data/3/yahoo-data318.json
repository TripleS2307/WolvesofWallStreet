The overall focus was on infrastructure and clean energy but a sizable chunk was devoted to one industry in particular: autos.Biden promises \u2013 through government purchases, new tax incentives and other measures \u2013 to lift up automakers and the businesses that supply them.\"Together, this will mean 1 million new, well paying jobs in the American automobile industry\" he said on Tuesday.The campaign likes to focus on Biden\u2019s role in the 2009 bailouts of General Motors and Chrysler. As Biden himself has often said, while making the case for his and Barack Obama\u2019s re-election in 2012, \u201cOsama bin Laden is dead, and General Motors is alive\u201d thanks to them.Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden speaks at a \"Build Back Better\" Clean Energy event on July 14. (OLIVIER DOULIERY/AFP via Getty Images)What he wants to do Biden\u2019s economic agenda is heavily reliant on federal spending and Tuesday\u2019s auto plan is no different. He promises his administration would \u201cuse all the levers of the federal government\u201d to help transition the auto industry towards a future dominated by electric vehicles.China is currently both the leader in manufacturing as well as using fully-electric cars. According to 2019 estimates, there were 7.2 million electric vehicles in operation globally: 47% of them were on the road in China and 20% were in the United States. The lion\u2019s share of the electric vehicles in the U.S. are made by Tesla (TSLA).The plan is to accelerate the upgrades of 3 million vehicles that the government regularly purchases anyway \u2013 think buses, mail trucks, and police cruisers. \u201cWe're going to convert these government fleets to electric vehicles made and sourced right here in the United States of the America,\u201d Biden said.A Biden administration would also try to increase both supply and demand by encouraging consumers to buy more cars and factories to increase their capacity in response to \u201ctargeted incentives.\u201d Details were not provided beyond that they would encourage electric cars made by unionized workers.Story continuesThe plan also promises new jobs through the federal government helping to build 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations, and also supporting research focused on battery technology.Will the industry will \u2018step up\u2019?In response to the incentives, Biden predicts the auto industry will \"step up.\" But it\u2019s an industry in the middle of a difficult moment.A 2017 report by think tank called RethinkX looked at the auto industry over the coming decade and predicted massive disruption by 2030, no matter who is president.Former Vice President Joe Biden spoke in Wilmington. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)The authors foresee a variety of factors \u2013 mostly around autonomous vehicles \u2013 converging with \u201cenormous implications across the transportation and oil industries\u201d with car companies being forced to adapt.Biden\u2019s plan says that the 1 million new auto industry jobs would be spread across the industry from manufacturing to supply chains to \u201cauto infrastructure.\u201dThe United Auto Workers union, which endorsed Biden in April, offered their support, saying the \u201cambitious plan is a win-win\u201d for the industry and its workers.The Trump campaign responded to Biden\u2019s plan, saying, \u201cGreen New Deal policies make it clear that union jobs related to oil, natural gas, fracking, and energy infrastructure will be on the chopping block\u201d in a Biden administration.The Biden campaign recently released its Unity Task Force recommendations that focus extensively on the climate but don\u2019t directly mention the Green New Deal. On his website, Biden has only partially embraced the proposal, saying it \u201cis a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face.\u201dWatch for the Biden campaign to focus on the auto industry \u2013 and the swing states in which most of its workers reside \u2013 heavily between now and the November election. On Tuesday, Biden said that the Obama administration had revitalized the auto industry and a Biden administration would do it again but this time \u201cbigger and faster and smarter.\u201dBen Werschkul is a producer for Yahoo Finance in Washington, DC.Read more:Biden\u2019s underwhelming economic planHere's what Joe Biden means for markets, business and AmericaFact or fiction?
