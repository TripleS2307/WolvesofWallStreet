In America\u2019s mirror, all she sees is regret. Instead of letting blood live, they begging for blood let.\u201dLL Cool J drops the mic by adding, \u201cBlack lives matter, forever.\u201dIn an interview with Yahoo Finance, the 52-year-old music mogul \u2014 born James Todd Smith \u2014 explains the rap simply reflects his feelings right now.\u201cI just feel like the world, a lot of people \u2014 the majority of people \u2014 are on the right side of history. And I feel like that small malignant group of racists are getting more and more marginalized you know, by global chemotherapy. And you know, they should because it\u2019s wrong. This was the first time that there was no debate [killing of George Floyd], right. He didn\u2019t go for the taser. Did he grab something? He did not. He didn\u2019t move or resist in that eight minutes and 46 seconds, no debate. I think that was the catalyst \u2014 I think that really just was a turning point for the globe,\u201d LL Cool J says.LL Cool J adds the video served as a wakeup call to the country that racism still very much exists and needs to be addressed more strongly.\u201cI think people said hey wait a minute, you guys are really treating these people bad. And so, I think ultimately we are one step closer to solving this problem. I don\u2019t think racism will ever totally go away, but I think it can be controlled. And I think it can be pushed back over in the corner where it belongs and ultimately destroyed. But I think things will get better,\u201d LL Cool J says.Story continuesAnd LL Cool J himself offered up his own wakeup call to investors (who have sent the stock market back near record highs) \u2014 respect what\u2019s happening out there on the streets.\u201cThe Dow could be at 100,000 right now. Yes, everybody who is part of the market would be over the moon, but if the morale [in the country] was lower than it has ever been, it's still not right. It doesn't feel good. What is the point,\u201d says LL Cool J. \u201cI think we not only have to be financially sound as a country we have to be morally sound, you know. I think none of us are perfect we are all a work in progress, but at least morally sound to a certain extent.\u201dLL\u2019s latest ventureThe singer, actor, husband and father of four is coming off the launch of his Rock The Bells brand this week.Rock The Bells \u2014 paying homage to the name of one of LL Cool J\u2019s biggest hits \u2014 targets the Gen X fans of classic hip-hop through a website that features written and video content from the legends of hip-hop such as Big Daddy Kane, Run DMC, Eric B, Salt-N-Pepa, Fab 5 Freddy, Risk, Crazy Legs, Roxanne Shant\u00e9 and Jonathan Mannion.

He hasn\u2019t released a new album in more than seven years, but tells Yahoo Finance he is working on something new.LL Cool J won\u2019t commit to it being an album squarely focused on the social issues being addressed across the nation at the moment. Instead in typical LL Cool J form, he will just let the creativity flow.\u201cI'm inspired to create right like there's no prediction,\u201d LL Cool J says, adding, \u201cOne thing will be clear though, it will be true, it won\u2019t be me pretending or a facade of any sort.\u201dBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
