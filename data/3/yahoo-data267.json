(AP Photo/Eric Gay)To speed up the delivery of the stimulus payments, the IRS relied on information from 2018 tax returns to determine eligibility, Treasury officials said. But the Treasury and IRS didn\u2019t use death records to filter out Americans who had passed when issuing the first three batches of payments in order to distribute the payments as \u201crapidly as possible.\u201d Those payments accounted for 72% of all payments, the report found.The IRS currently doesn't have a plan to take additional steps to notify ineligible recipients on how to return payments, the report found. But under the FAQ section of the IRS website, the agency does address if someone who has died qualifies for a payment.Read more: Coronavirus stimulus checks: Why your payment would be smaller than expected\u201cNo. A Payment made to someone who died before receipt of the Payment should be returned to the IRS by following the instructions in the Q&A about repayments,\u201d the website states. The instructions outline how to return a paper check, direct deposit, and stimulus debit card.Story continuesTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also said in an April 29 statement that relatives who have received a stimulus payment for a deceased family member must return it to the federal government.\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to keep that payment,\u201d Mnuchin said in a statement to Yahoo Money. \u201cWe\u2019re checking the databases, but there could be a scenario where we missed something, and yes, the heirs should be returning that money.\u201dWhat to do if you think you received the wrong amount?Along with their payments, recipients will get a letter confirming the amount of the payment. This letter, called a Notice 1444, will be mailed to each recipient\u2019s address within a few weeks after the stimulus payment has been made. It\u2019s important to save the letter if you believe the amount of your economic impact payment is wrong, according to the Internal Revenue Service.\u201cWhen you file your 2020 tax return next year, you can refer to Notice 1444 and claim additional credits on your 2020 tax return if you are eligible for them,\u201d the IRS said.To determine the amount you\u2019re eligible for, you can use the IRS\u2019 \u201cCalculate My Payment\u201d chart. If you didn\u2019t receive the full amount that you were entitled to, you can claim the additional amount on your 2020 tax return when you file your taxes next year.The payment amount is based on the information you have provided on your 2019 tax return, if it has been submitted or processed. Otherwise, the size of your payment is based on your 2018 taxes.Those who didn\u2019t receive the additional $500-per-child bonus will also be able to claim the additional amount when they file their 2020 tax return.How to request a stimulus check trace?Notice 1444 will also help some Americans who haven\u2019t received their payment to initiate a stimulus check trace.If you\u2019ve received your Notice 1444 and the IRS \u2018Get My Payment\u2019 tracking tool indicates your payment has been issued, but you received no payment, you can request a trace by the IRS.You can request a trace if you haven\u2019t received your payment and it has been:Five days since the scheduled deposit date,Four weeks since it was mailed by check to a standard address,Six weeks since it was mailed, and you have a forwarding address on file with the local post office,or, nine weeks since it was mailed, and you have a foreign address.The IRS advises not to request a payment trace to determine your eligibility, the amount of payment you should have received, or if you haven\u2019t received a Notice 1444 or a payment date from the \u2018Get My Payment\u2019 tool.What should I do if I didn\u2019t get a check?If you don\u2019t file taxes and you haven\u2019t received a stimulus check, you can submit your information through IRS Non-Filers Tool by Oct. 15 to get your payment. Americans with income below $12,200 and who haven\u2019t filed a tax return for 2018 and 2019 can use the tool to add basic personal information in order to receive the payment.Those who pay taxes and believe they\u2019re eligible for a stimulus payment but didn\u2019t receive one will be able to claim it when they file their tax returns for 2020.
