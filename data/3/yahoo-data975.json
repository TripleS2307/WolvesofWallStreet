In 2018, Trump called JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon a \u201cnervous mess\u201d after the bank executive said he was \u201csmarter\u201d than Trump.The year before, Merck CEO Ken Frazier set off a wave of resignations from a business advisory council for the president, following remarks from Trump that appeared to draw equivalence between white supremacists and counter-protesters at a rally in Charlottesville, Va.In response, Trump immediately criticized Frazier, tweeting that the resignation would afford him \"more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\u201dThe Trump administration has drawn criticism from public health experts and political opponents in recent months for what some consider a failure to adequately address the coronavirus outbreak in its early stages, and for false statements that largely downplayed the threat of the virus.Trump has repeatedly said \u201cnobody\u201d could have foreseen the pandemic though he reportedly received dire warnings as early as February.Top business leaders have largely avoided public criticism of Trump amid the pandemic, but on a conference call in May about three dozen executives told him to \u201cdramatically increase\u201d testing capacity in order to make Americans feel comfortable going back to normal everyday activities, the Wall Street Journal reported.Story continuesMehta said Trump\u2019s mishandling of the crisis left an opening for the private sector, which mobilized to produce medical equipment and other supplies.\u201cWeirdly, business, which was never created for social impact purposes, seems to be taking the lead here in terms of showing inspiration and leadership.\u201dFast Company Editor-in-Chief Stephanie Mehta appears on \"Influencers with Andy Serwer.\"Mehta made the remarks in an episode of Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cInfluencers with Andy Serwer,\u201d a weekly interview series with leaders in business, politics, and entertainment.Since 2018, Mehta has served as the editor-in-chief of Fast Company. Prior to her current position, she worked in various reporting and editing roles at the Wall Street Journal, Fortune, Bloomberg, and Vanity Fair.At Fortune, she worked with Serwer, who left the publication in 2014 and became Editor-in-Chief of Yahoo Finance the following year.Mehta criticized what she considers the Trump administration\u2019s failure to provide reliable information and adequate leadership during the pandemic.\u201cI, like a lot of Americans, have been really frustrated with the federal government's response and Donald Trump's response in particular, because people are looking for inspiration, but they're also looking for candor and honesty,\u201d she says.\u201cClearly that has not been a hallmark of this administration, in my humble opinion,\u201d she adds.Read more:Michael Dell: \u2018Not enough\u2019 progress on diversity in the tech industryU.S. needs 'cultural transformation' after George Floyd's death: Chase KochMelinda Gates: Some governors are \u2018moving too fast\u2019 to reopen their states\u2018We may need to quarantine our books' when libraries reopen, New York Public Library CEO saysRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"}]}
