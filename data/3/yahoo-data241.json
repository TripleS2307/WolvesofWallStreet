Hawaii, Louisiana and Nevada have had some of the highest unemployment rates in the country. Tourism-based economies like Florida\u2019s have also stagnated during the coronavirus pandemic, causing housing insecurity.\u201cThe Trump administration has maintained that no one should risk losing their home due to the coronavirus,\u201d said U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson.Policy changes impacting rent paymentThe nadir of rent payment comes during the first month of President Trump\u2019s eviction moratorium, instituted September 1, which bans evictions \u2014 in effect, allowing delayed rent payments \u2014 through December 31.\u201cThe Trump administration has maintained that no one should risk losing their home due to the coronavirus,\u201d said U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken several actions since the beginning of this pandemic to keep Americans in their homes.\u201dDespite the short-term relief, some critics say the program leaves landlords in the lurch and renters with months of delayed payments will come due in January, unless further action is taken. A third of renters had unpaid back-rent in September, according to Apartment List, a San Francisco-based renting platform.Story continues\u201cThe latest eviction ban from the CDC may apply to more tenants than the previous moratorium, but it comes with requirements. Tenants feeling the pinch and unable to make their monthly rent are no doubt scrambling for answers. And landlords with a mortgage payment likely are too,\u201d said Elizabeth Renter, data analyst at NerdWallet, a San Francisco-based personal finance company.The low payment rate also comes as renters are in the second month without extra unemployment benefits provided in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES), when many experts predicted unemployed renters would run out of savings to pay bills. The CARES Act also prohibited evictions in properties with federally-backed mortgages.\u201cInstead of being satisfied with a half-baked nationwide eviction moratorium which does nothing to deal with renters\u2019 real underlying problem \u2013 financial distress \u2013 lawmakers should instead look to the successful model of the CARES Act and provide economic support to those who need it most \u2013 the tens-of-millions that call an apartment home, revitalizing the recovery at the same time,\u201d said Bibby.Sarah Paynter is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
