Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) will defeat Trump in November.What's more, Summers contends that a Biden administration will restore and accomplish several things that will benefit the country, from restoring the office's traditions and norms to enacting policies that support the middle class.\"I think they will bring a return to traditional norms of American civility and seriousness of purpose, whether the issue is listening to public health professionals on a disease, whether the issue is consulting in civil ways with our allies on matters of international concern, whether the issue is engagement with all Americans being treated equally, rather than appealing to racism,\" Summers said.He added that the Biden-Harris ticket put forth \"powerful ideas for addressing some of the most pressing problems that we face,\" pointing to green investments, health care, taxes, and inequality.Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden gestures as he speaks at a campaign event, on his first joint appearance with Vice presidential candidate Senator Kamala Harris after being named his running mate, at Alexis Dupont High School in Wilmington, Delaware, U.S., August 12, 2020.

But, I can tell you that the data are remarkably clear that, on average, the stock markets, on average, corporate profits, do better during Democratic administrations than they do during Republican administrations. And, so it's not just the little guy that does better. It's actually capital and Corporate America that does better.\"Story continuesThe economist explained that's because \"the foundation of our economy is the middle class, and when you have policies that are based around supporting the middle class it ends up being better for everyone.\"\"And when you have policies that rely on a trickle-down theory, it's not even best for those who have bought into the implementation of those policies,\" Summers added.Julia La Roche is a Correspondent for Yahoo Finance.
