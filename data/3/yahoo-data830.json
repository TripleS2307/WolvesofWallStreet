The Nasdaq sank 4% on the day.\u201cThe sell-off in risky assets has been concentrated in US Tech and momentum stocks, while credit has been more resilient and outperformed its beta to equity,\u201d according to a note from Goldman Sachs strategists over the weekend. \u201cThis is likely due to the unwinding of some of the popular positions into the largest US stocks. In fact, the US equity rally has been very concentrated so far with very low breadth.\u201d\u201cWhile aggregate US equity future net length is not very stretched, Nasdaq net equity future positioning is close to historical highs,\u201d the analysts said. They added that an increase in the 10-year Treasury yield off the pandemic-era lows also likely triggered a rotation out of longer-duration stocks, including growth and tech names.Still, the analysts added they \u201cexpect the current bull market to continue as the improved growth outlook coupled with supportive monetary policies should maintain the search for yield elevated and foster a compression of the ERPs [equity risk premiums].\u201dElsewhere, investors eyed developments on the Covid-19 vaccine front.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said seeing a vaccine receive approval by October was \u201cunlikely\u201d but \u201cnot impossible,\u201d according to a recent interview with CNN.\u20144:07 p.m. ET: S&P 500 drops to the lowest level in a month, Nasdaq slides 4% as tech rout continuesHere were the main moves in markets as of 4:07 p.m. ET:S&P 500 (^GSPC): -95.12 (-2.78%) to 3,331.84Dow (^DJI): -632.42 (-2.25%) to 27,500.89Nasdaq (^IXIC): -465.44 (-4.11%) to 10,847.69Crude (CL=F): -$2.88 (-7.24%) to $36.89 a barrelGold (GC=F): +$5.70 (+0.29%) to $1,940.00 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): -3.7 bps to yield 0.6840%2:35 p.m. ET: Stocks hold lower, Dow drops 450+ pointsThe three major indices held sharply lower Tuesday afternoon, with less than 90 minutes left of the regular trading session.
