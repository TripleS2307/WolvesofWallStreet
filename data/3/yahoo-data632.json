It mostly served as just a windfall handout. And I think that if you back to a totally reasonable level of corporate tax and you couple it with direct public investments as well as incentives for companies to make new investments, you can definitely prevent any downturn in corporate investment and GDP.\u201dUnveiled last week, the former vice president\u2019s \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d plan is in line with many traditional Democratic efforts around expanded social safety nets and infrastructure investments. The size of the package tallies $700 billion, and leans a bit more left than some would have thought, according to experts.The former vice president has put forth reversing half of President Trump\u2019s signature tax cuts to help pay for the plan. He would lift the statutory tax rate to 28% from its current 21%, which Trump confidante Stephen Moore said is akin to \u201csupreme economic masochism.\u201d This move alone could slash north of 10% off of 2021 S&P 500 earnings estimates if enacted, various investment banks have written. Investment pros have told Yahoo Finance the hike in corporate taxes by itself could cause at least a 20% stock market correction as investors adjust their profit expectations.Former Vice President Joe Biden speaks during the U.S. Conference of Mayors Annual Winter Meeting in Washington.

He added that it was time to end \u201cshareholder capitalism.\u201dGoolsbee contends Wall Street isn\u2019t totally against Biden\u2019s proposals.\u201cI haven\u2019t gotten that negative vibe from investors. The basics of the plan are about investment and rebuilding the needed infrastructure broadly that the country needs. Physical infrastructure, technological infrastructure, a bunch of things where we let it hollow out. For sure that has affected workers, but it\u2019s not Wall Street and Main Street economy are not on different islands. Wall Street, it might be on an island, but it\u2019s not on an island in the economic sense,\u201d Goolsbee added.Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
