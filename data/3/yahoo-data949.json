Listen to the episode here.After the Financial Crisis, for-profit schools prospered across America at the expense of students saddled with thousands of dollars in debt, employees abandoned or implicated, and the government swindled out of taxpayer money.A Florida-based for-profit school called Fast Train (FT), which maintained seven campuses across the state from Clearwater to South Florida, exemplified the greed and shady tactics behind the boom.The FastTrain campus in Plantation, Fla. (Miami Herald/Tribune News Service via Getty Images)When enrollments at the campuses in northern Florida dropped, according to court documents, Fast Train CEO Alejandro Amor brought the director of admissions at Fast Train\u2019s Jacksonville campus to Miami and showed him recruiting methods, which involved driving around low-income areas and pitching students without high school diplomas.\u201cThere were so many different students who were being preyed upon in different ways, and these schools\u2026 this whole thing dehumanizes people,\u201d said Alex Shebanow, a filmmaker who made the 2018 documentary \u201cFail State\u201d investigating the for-profit college industry in America.\u201cWe saw the schools viewed these students as nothing more than dollar signs with heartbeats,\u201d Shebanow told Yahoo Finance\u2019s Illegal Tender podcast.A neon sign at Pan American Art Projects.

Listen to the episode here.Amor told another admissions director to increase enrollment numbers by driving through low-income neighborhoods with a recruiter who \u201cstopped random men on street corners and bus stops and asked them to attend FT.\u201dWhen man they pitched said he didn\u2019t have a high school diploma, the recruiter said that was fine and that \u201che would just have to keep it a secret between the two of them.\u201dThe Tampa admissions director said the recruiter he was with \u201cwas a former exotic dancer and dressed very provocatively\u201d and that the entire act was \u201call a part of the recruiting effort for FT.\u201dStory continuesA strip club in Miami.

Listen to the episode here.\u2018There's no way I could pay that\u2019In St. Louis, Missouri, a student who attended the now-defunct for-profit college ITT Tech said that his desire to better himself left him with a miserable experience that continues to haunt him years later.\u201cI should have recognized the red flags and the warning signs,\u201d Matt Wood told Illegal Tender, noting that his classes were \u201cwatered down\u201d and used unlicensed software.At one point, Wood was approached by a mysterious women demanding him to take out more loans.\u201cI would say probably two weeks before I was supposed to get my associate's degree, I'm sitting in class and a woman comes in looking for me,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI've never seen this woman in our campus before. don't remember her name, don't know who she was, but she pulls me into her office area to this little meeting room and was saying that I was in trouble of needing more funding, and we needed to act now to figure out what we need to do to be able for me to be able to graduate.\u201dThe woman told Wood that if he didn\u2019t get the additional funds, he wasn\u2019t going to get his associate\u2019s degree.\u201cI mean, this was literally two weeks before graduation \u2026 so she was acting off panicked and concerned and that if I didn't get any more funding, I wasn't going to be able to graduate,\u201d he said.Wood, who took out $10,000 in loans at an interest rate of 11%, later learned that she was \u201cgetting me signed up for these high interest PEAKS private loans, which was like ITT Tech's private loan system that they were using to try to get more money.\u201dHe recalled telling the school that the loan payments were \u201calmost double what I'm paying in rent right now. I'm making $9 an hour working at Game Stop. There's no way I could pay that.\u201dPEAKS loans are the subject of several legal actions. A complaint brought forward by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found that many students were rushed through the process \u2014 like being pulled out of classes or being told that these loans were necessary by their own instructors.Creditors came after Wood and people close to him but stopped after the loans were likely forgiven as per a June 2019 settlement.This is the first part of Yahoo Finance\u2019s Illegal Tender podcast series on for-profit colleges.

How can I do more deceptive advertising? How can I push our recruiters to say whatever it takes to sign up students? So it is in various forms and in various ways, it's about greed and it looks like it is very difficult to reconcile the profit motive with the public good.\u201dPublicly-listed for-profit schools report earnings, providing a glimpse of how they view the business landscape. Strategic Education (STRA), which owns Capella and Strayer, reported earnings this week.The company had a strong first half, reporting revenue growth in the second quarter of 4.4% \u2014 driven by nearly 4% total enrollment growth \u2014 and adjusted operating income being up 37% year-over-year.In an earnings call with analysts, Strategic Education Executive Chairman Robert S. Silberman noted that the ongoing coronavirus pandemic is \u201chighlighting some of the significant advantages of our academic model and our comfort with online academic technology.\u201dA commencement ceremony for Strayer University, a private, for-profit educational institution.

(PHOTO: Brooks Kraft LLC/Corbis via Getty Images)Strategic Education President and CEO, Karl McDonnell said that performance was looking good: A 4% decline in new student enrollments at Strayer year-over-year but a 1% increase at Capella while total enrollment also grew at both universities.A 2018 lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota against Capella University alleged that students were actively recruited for doctoral programs and ended up taking on thousands of dollars in student debt before experiencing significant roadblocks when they actually tried to graduate.\u201cGoing to Capella was supposed to be a part of advancing my career in life\u2026 I feel like I was misled at every turn,\u201d Louis DeWeaver, an Air Force veteran from Michigan in his 50s, told reporters. \u201cThey made it sound like there was structure and pathway to completing their online courses within a reasonable time frame and at a reasonable cost. \u2026 But I faced roadblocks\u2026 at every turn\u2026 and every time things slowed down, it cost me more and more money.\u201dCapella University countered that the lawsuit is \u201cwithout merit\u201d and that the court has \u201calready dismissed 40 of the 45 legal claims and eight out of nine plaintiffs.\u201dThis is the first part of Yahoo Finance\u2019s Illegal Tender podcast series on for-profit colleges.
