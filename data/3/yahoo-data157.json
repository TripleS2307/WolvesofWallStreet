The order includes the H-1B visa \u2014 which many tech companies rely on to hire highly skilled workers. (The U.S. caps the number of H-1B visas at 85,000 per year.) Some H-2B, H-4, L and J visas are also included in the suspension.The order also extended an existing suspension of most green cards.\u201cWe want to give jobs to Americans right now,\u201d said Trump when asked about the green card decision on Tuesday afternoon.The administration says the goal is to free up jobs for Americans, as tens of millions of people remain unemployed due to the coronavirus pandemic. A senior administration official said the immigration crackdown will preserve about 525,000 jobs for Americans, but the business community argues the move will hurt the U.S. economy in the long run.The U.S. Chamber of Commerce called the order a \u201csevere and sweeping attempt to restrict legal immigration.\u201d\u201cPutting up a \u2018not welcome\u2019 sign for engineers, executives, IT experts, doctors, nurses and other workers won\u2019t help our country, it will hold us back. Restrictive changes to our nation\u2019s immigration system will push investment and economic activity abroad, slow growth, and reduce job creation,\u201d said U.S. Chamber CEO Thomas Donohue in a statement.The Internet Association \u2014 whose members include Amazon, Facebook, Google, Uber and many others \u2014 focused on the H-1B visa suspensions.\u201cIA condemns the administration\u2019s latest executive order that will limit the number of high-skilled foreign workers from entering the country through the end of the year,\u201d said IA Director of Social Impact Sean Perryman. \u201cThe diverse and accomplished H-1B visa holders in the U.S. create American jobs and help our economy grow. All industries benefit from a visa system that allows U.S. companies to attract the best and brightest no matter where they\u2019re from.\u201dStory continuesThe leaders of several companies spoke out individually as well.AlphabetSundar Pichai \u2014 CEO of Alphabet and its subsidiary, Google (GOOG) \u2014 tweeted that he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the proclamation and that \u201cImmigration has contributed immensely to America\u2019s economic success, making it a global leader in tech, and also Google the company it is today.\u201dImmigration has contributed immensely to America\u2019s economic success, making it a global leader in tech, and also Google the company it is today. Disappointed by today\u2019s proclamation - we\u2019ll continue to stand with immigrants and work to expand opportunity for all.\u2014 Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) June 22, 2020YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki agreed with Pichai, saying via Twitter, \u201cImmigration is central to America's story, and it's central to my own family's story. My family escaped danger and found a new home in America. @sundarpichai is right - at @YouTube, we join Google in standing with immigrants and working to expand opportunity for all.\u201dAppleApple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook also said he was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d in the order. \u201cLike Apple, this nation of immigrants has always found strength in our diversity, and hope in the enduring promise of the American Dream. There is no new prosperity without both,\u201d Cook tweeted.Tesla\u201cVery much disagree with this action. In my experience, these skillsets are net job creators,\u201d tweeted Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk.Musk went on to say that while visa reform makes sense, the Trump administration\u2019s action was \u201ctoo broad.\u201dIn addition to the suspensions, the administration said it is moving to make permanent changes to the H-1B visa \u2014 moving away from a lottery system, to prioritizing applicants with the highest salary offers. A senior administration official said the changes will drive up the wage and skill level of immigrants.SpaceX founder Elon Musk after watching the successful launch of a Falcon 9 rocket with the Crew Dragon spacecraft from pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center.

Welcoming the best & the brightest global talent is critical to America's economic recovery. We will continue to support these programs & efforts to protect the rights of immigrants,\u201d the company said on its policy Twitter account.Twitter\u201cThis proclamation undermines America\u2019s greatest economic asset: its diversity. People from all over the world come here to join our labor force, pay taxes, and contribute to our global competitiveness on the world stage,\u201d said Jessica Herrera-Flanigan, Twitter\u2019s (TWTR) VP or Public Policy and Philanthropy on the company\u2019s public policy Twitter account.\"Unilaterally and unnecessarily stifling America\u2019s attractiveness to global, high-skilled talent is short-sighted and deeply damaging to the economic strength of the United States,\u201d she added.FacebookIn statement, a Facebook (FB) spokesperson said the proclamation will make the U.S. economic recovery even more difficult.\u201cAmerica is a nation of immigrants and our economy and country benefit when we encourage talented people from around the world to live, work, and contribute here. That\u2019s more true now than ever. Highly-skilled visa holders play a critical role in driving innovation \u2013 at Facebook and at organizations across the country \u2013 and that\u2019s something we should encourage, not restrict,\u201d said the spokesperson.MicrosoftBrad Smith, president of Microsoft (MSFT), said in part, \u201cImmigrants play a vital role at our company and support our country at a time when we need them most.\u201dNow is not the time to cut our nation off from the world\u2019s talent or create uncertainty and anxiety. Immigrants play a vital role at our company and support our country\u2019s critical infrastructure. They are contributing to this country at a time when we need them most.\u2014 Brad Smith (@BradSmi) June 23, 2020Despite the opposition from the business community, the order is set to go into effect on June 24 and last through the end of the year.Yahoo Finance asked the White House for a response to the backlash, but has not yet received a comment.Jessica Smith is a reporter for Yahoo Finance based in Washington, D.C.
