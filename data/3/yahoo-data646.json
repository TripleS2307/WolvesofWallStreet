With the deposits, the company, which the CFPB says called itself a \u201ccommercial bank,\u201d would purportedly make loans to medical professionals, which it said represented a low credit risk. The company denies that it called itself a \u201ccommercial bank.\u201dWith the very best rates of the online banks (Marcus, Ally, Synchrony) paying around 2% APY, the numbers stuck out because they were pitched as an almost risk-free investment with returns rivaling the stock market\u2019s.But this week, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau filed suit against the company and its CEO Dr. Edgar Radjabli for \"deceptive acts and practices in marketing a savings CD account.\"Among the practices the CFPB alleges: taking money from people who thought it was going to insured cash-equivalent accounts and instead using the funds to trade stocks.More than 400 people put money into the supposed high-yielding CDs, totaling over $15 million. The minimum deposit for the \u201cbest savings rate in the US\u201d was $1,000, with withdrawals with one month\u2019s notice allowed and no fees.\u201cLoan Doctor and Radjabli falsely represented that Loan Doctor was a commercial bank and that consumers\u2019 deposits were safe and comparable to a traditional savings account with a guaranteed return,\u201d wrote the Bureau in a press release. \u201cIn fact, Loan Doctor was not a commercial bank, and consumers\u2019 deposits were invested in volatile securities or securities-backed investments.\u201dIn a statement provided by the Loan Doctor\u2019s attorney Anthony Alexis, a former CFPB assistant director and head of the office of enforcement now in the private sector, the company denied the claims and explained why it did not settle with the Bureau as most companies do.\u201cEven though we cooperated fully with the CFPB, we could not reach a final resolution that provided a truthful narrative for the facts and circumstances surrounding the product and all that Loan Doctor has done to correct the regulatory requirements the CFPB claims needed to be addressed,\u201d said Alexis.Story continuesAlexis added that the Bureau refused to acknowledge that the company has returned all invested money including the interest it had promised.\u201cTo our knowledge, there were no complaints and the program presented a great investment opportunity during a time of significant economic and financial stress,\u201d said Alexis. \u201cConfident that the allegations have no merit, Loan Doctor looks forward to clearing its name and continuing to provide quality services to healthcare professionals soon.\u201dTargeted Facebook ads, and a heavy dose of skepticismMillions love high-yield savings accounts because they pay some of the highest interest rates of accounts with FDIC security. If the bank goes bust, the government will make things right for balances up to $250,000 per account.The Loan Doctor, according to the CFPB, marketed itself as putting deposits into \u201can FDIC-insured account, an account insured by Lloyd\u2019s of London, or a \u2018cash alternative\u2019 or \u2018cash equivalent,\u2019 and, further, that Loan Doctor would maintain a cash reserve in an amount \u2018equivalent to\u2019 the amount consumers deposited.\u201dAt a glance \u2014 at least the 400 people who put money in \u2014 this might seem as if it means the money is completely safe, but the CFPB said it wasn\u2019t.According to the complaint against it, the company \u201cfalsely touted the stability of its HCF High Yield CD Accounts by likening those accounts to various types of savings accounts and falsely describing itself as a \u201ccommercial bank.\u201dThe company's FAQ page says that the accounts are currently closed. The BBB website does not have a rating for it currently, though the company claims an \"A-\" rating. (Yahoo Finance screenshot)Contemporaneous posts on Reddit show that at least some people were curious, but many thought it was a \u201cscam\u201d and didn\u2019t \u201clook legit.\u201d One skeptical Redditor noted that despite the FDIC name-drop, Loan Doctor didn\u2019t say it was insured anywhere. \u201cYour deposits are not protected,\u201d they wrote.However, that loophole wasn\u2019t even true for the Loan Doctor. In its fine print, according to the CFPB, it said, \u201cthe principal is guaranteed and insured. The interest is not, but we have paid 6% through all of 2019 and 5% to 6.25% in years prior.\u201d\u201cThose who participated in this product were sophisticated investors \u2013 many invested hundreds of thousands of dollars,\u201d said Alexis. \u201cThe product included a clear customer agreement, with all required disclosures and information, none of which were challenged by the CFPB in its investigation or its complaint.\u201dThe complaint also alleges that the company falsely represented past returns.To blast these claims out, the company turned to the tried-and-true method of Facebook and Google ad targeting, hoping to lure the digitally savvy but naive into thinking that they had found the one risk-free high-yield secret.One Facebook post read: \u201cHey Mom and Dad, Are you getting a Guaranteed 6% APY on my college fund?\u201dMost of the claims were untrue, the CFPB alleges. The Loan Doctor claimed to have buyers for the loans it originated beforehand, which it didn\u2019t. It also claimed to have originated $500 million in loans.\u201cIn fact, Loan Doctor never originated a loan for a healthcare professional,\u201d the CFPB wrote in the complaint.CFPB asks the Loan Doctor to stop, but it keeps operatingIn March, the CFPB asked the Loan Doctor to stop offering and marketing the CD accounts.According to the Bureau, it only \"partially\" stopped operating, but continued to sell the products under a different name \"while still concealing its risks to consumers,\" after seeking advice from financial advisors on how to find a new name that wasn't a CD that \"conveys the security, predictable income, imperviousness to stock market volatility, etc., of the product but without sounding like a bank product.\"Getty ImagesThe Loan Doctor story is probably over \u2014 though it will fight in court \u2014 but it\u2019s relevant given the current climate of the economy and stock market. The story comes as interest rates for high-yield savings accounts and CDs continue to drop, with some of the highest-paying accounts from places like Ally (ALLY) and Marcus (GS) recently dropping their rates once again to 1.00% APY. In early 2019, Marcus paid out 2.25% APY.These may be historically good, much higher than the current national APY average of around 0.10%, but they\u2019re much lower than the 2.25% they were two years ago. Promises of higher rates are certainly alluring, especially with the most volatile market since the Financial Crisis.Though it probably sounded too good to be true to most people \u2014 including the Redditors \u2014 as did almost everyone in the media, who didn\u2019t write about this, 400 people did cough up at least $1,000 each.There\u2019s essentially nothing on the Loan Doctor in the financial media, save for an interview with Nasdaq TV that was uploaded by the company itself to YouTube and posted on the company\u2019s home page. The company\u2019s press page hosts many links to \u201cmedia\u201d articles \u2014 including Yahoo Finance \u2014 but they\u2019re just press releases from Cison PR Newswire, not actual news stories.If there\u2019s one key takeaway from all this, it\u2019s yet another reminder that free lunches don\u2019t exist and putting your money on the line to get one can be a very risky thing indeed.Update 5/21: Added company statement that it denies that it called itself a \u201ccommercial bank\u201d as alleged by the CFPB.--Ethan Wolff-Mann is a writer at Yahoo Finance focusing on consumer issues, personal finance, retail, airlines, and more.
