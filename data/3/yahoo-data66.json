These Eurozone cities have sky-high asking prices paired with local laws that limit profitability for real estate investors \u2014 and they might not be willing to pay anymore.\u201cIn some of the European cities, there is a high degree of rent control,\u201d said Jonathan Woloshin, head of U.S. real estate at UBS Global wealth management\u2019s chief investment office. \u201cEspecially if you are buying a property to rent it out, it\u2019s less attractive.\u201dAnd for the first time, Zurich also joined the list of cities that are at risk of a housing bubble. Employment growth, investment appeal and falling mortgage rates have driven up prices in the Swiss city 50% since 2010 \u2014 prices which experts believe people will be unwilling to pay within the next few quarters, causing high prices to drop.Credit: UBS Global Real Estate Bubble index\u201cIt\u2019s clear that the current acceleration is not sustainable. Rents have been falling already in most cities, indicating that a correction phase will likely emerge,\u201d said the report.The only North American city at risk of a housing bubble was Toronto, but its ranking improved from last year, when prices were even higher. Toronto cooled when the government instituted taxes on foreign buyers, vacancy fees and stricter rent controls, which prompted a 10% price correction in 2019, according to the study.Story continuesThe only city in Asia at risk of a housing bubble was Hong Kong, but it too cooled down this year. Home prices in Hong Kong almost quadrupled from 2003 to 2019, but prices came down 5% from their peak.\u201cWe definitely have some reshuffling of the deck. Near term, some markets with traditional strength \u2014 some of that strength is pulling back,\u201d said Woloshin.Chicago was the only city considered \"undervalued\" in the study.

Most cities like New York and San Francisco were rated as \u201covervalued\u201d but not at risk of a sharp price correction, even as the U.S. experiences suburbanization.Though record numbers of city-dwellers have moved to the suburbs during the coronavirus pandemic, New York City and San Francisco are not at high risk of a sharp price correction because of a historic supply shortage and sustained global demand from wealthy investors, according to the study.\u201cEspecially in New York, we have seen some outmigration \u2014 with people working from home, they don\u2019t need to stay in expensive cities. So there\u2019s a cooling in prices,\u201d said Woloshin. \u201cAnd San Francisco was the most expensive city in the U.S. for a number of years \u2014 and it\u2019s still very expensive \u2014 but so many tech companies are allowing people to work remotely that there is out-migration to less expensive markets.\u201dThe only undervalued city in the study was Chicago, though it is slightly less undervalued than it was last year. Since 2015, home prices in Chicago have appreciated at half the rate of the average home in the U.S., in part due to population decline and the city government\u2019s high debt.\u201cChicago\u2019s the one market that has been pretty consistent in terms of being lower on the bubble risk, and that\u2019s really a function of the fact that they haven\u2019t experienced the price growth that other cities have seen,\u201d said Woloshin.Sarah Paynter is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
