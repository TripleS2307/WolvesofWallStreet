Amid a surge in coronavirus infections and hospitalizations, Gov. Greg Abbott issued a statewide order mandating public masking, and moved to limit outdoor gatherings of more than 10 people.Wearing a face covering in public is proven to be one of the most effective ways to slow the spread of #COVID19 while continuing to keep Texas businesses open.
