What\u2019s more, Pew found an increasing percentage of republican and republican leaning Americans surveyed believe social media sites are biased, compared with a reduction in Democrat and Democrat-leading respondents.There has been a steady stream of complaints regarding social media sites and claims of bias for some time now. During a recent hearing before the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law investigating antitrust violations among Big Tech firms, a number of conservative lawmakers pressured Facebook and Google about perceived bias.But according to Corynne McSherry, legal director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a non-profit civil liberties organization dedicated to protecting online speech, there\u2019s been no real evidence of any partisan political bias from social networks.Story continuesTwitter has come under fire for blocking tweets by President Trump that violated the company's terms of service. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File)\u201cI\u2019m not surprised that many Americans think this, given that there are plenty of political leaders and pundits who are insisting it is true. But as a practical matter, we haven\u2019t seen evidence that social media platforms moderate on a partisan basis,\u201d she told Yahoo Finance.Instead, McSherry says the EFF has found that traditionally marginalized groups are the ones that are silenced in the U.S., as well as in countries where citizens don\u2019t have First Amendment rights like those e Americans enjoy The group is asking online platforms to provide transparency reports covering when content is taken down and why.What\u2019s more, a July study found that there was little evidence of bias against conservative voices on Twitter in particular. Facebook and Google have similarly denied accusations in the past.Facebook, in fact, has gone to such lengths to appease conservative voices who complain of censorship that, according to NBC News, the company ignored its own rules about misinformation when it came to posts by conservative outlets like Breitbart.Increased scrutiny of social media sitesTrump, meanwhile, has called for a repeal of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which provides online platforms that host user-generated content, which is virtually all internet sites, with liability protection. His distaste for the law peaked when Twitter blocked one of his tweets that stated in part, \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts,\u201d in reference to early protests that saw rioting following the death of George Floyd.Twitter blocked the tweet saying that it glorified violence. The move came shortly after Twitter labeled a previous tweet by Trump with a fact-check marker after he claimed that mail-in voting would lead to election fraud.Facebook, which has taken heat for its stance on allowing politicians to spread misinformation, also took action against Trump\u2019s campaign for using a symbol associated with Nazism to decry a supposed Antifa uprising, and spreading misinformation about children being immune to COVID-19.But Americans surveyed by Pew say they don\u2019t trust social media sites to accurately label misinformation, with 66% saying they have \u201cnot too much\u201d or \u201cno confidence\u201d in the ability of social media sites to label such content.Social media sites certainly haven\u2019t made it easy to trust them either, thanks to a seemingly endless line of issues ranging from data misuse to foreign interference in national politics. And there are times when internet platforms remove content by accident.Until social networks can regain users\u2019 trust, the perception of bias will likely continue to percolate unabated.Got a tip?
