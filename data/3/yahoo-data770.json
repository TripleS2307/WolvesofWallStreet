I say this because the students who gathered on the Quad last night may have done damage enough to shut down campus, including residence halls and in-person learning, before the academic semester even begins.\u201d\u2018Be better. Be adults.\u2019That some 18-to-22-year-olds would eschew rules upon returning to campus life is no surprise. That said, given that many schools rely on tuition to survive from year to year, college officials are trying.\u201cAll these schools that are inviting people back in, of course, you have to ask yourself: Why would they do that?\u201d Paul Quinn College President Michael J.

Prove them wrong. Be better. Be adults.\u201dStory continues\u2018I was super glad they sent that warning out\u2019The stern warnings are being followed by signs of enforcement.At the University of Michigan, off-campus student behavior will be monitored by \u201cambassadors\u201d who will initially work from noon to midnight, seven days a week to \u201cserve as a visible presence and reminder to students and other community members of the need to follow public health guidance.\u201dHere\u2019s what ambassadors will be wearing pic.twitter.com/xA1jrstkQy\u2014 Calder Lewis (@CalderLewisTMD) August 20, 2020At the University of Connecticut, several students were reportedly evicted from on-campus housing after videos surfaced of them throwing a dorm party this week.Not all students support their peers disregarding the risk of spreading coronavirus.An education major and resident assistant at a small college in Indiana, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of social backlash, told Yahoo Finance that she\u2019s worried after hearing about parties from other students.\u201cThree were hosted by sports teams (baseball, men\u2019s basketball, and women\u2019s basketball) and the other was ran by a fraternity on campus,\u201d she said. \"I\u2019m worried sick that [students who go to parties] are going to get each other sick and possible cause someone to die early in their lives.\u201d\u26a0\ufe0fUniversity of Connecticut officials evicted several students from on-campus housing after learning of a crowded dormitory room party with no mask wearing or social distancing, which violated the school\u2019s #coronavirus rules. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f https://t.co/TciVQqtkAv pic.twitter.com/k6sVrf39Cz\u2014 Cleavon MD (@Cleavon_MD) August 20, 2020Bryce, a 20-year-old industrial engineering technology student at Purdue University in Indiana, felt reassured after the university told students in an email that the school would be taking \u201chard line\u201d against parties and unsafe gatherings.\u201cThey basically warned those that wanted to come to campus to party that they weren\u2019t welcome,\u201d Bryce told Yahoo Finance. \u201cI was super glad they sent that warning out.\u201dOn Thursday, Purdue suspended 36 students for attending a party deemed unsafe. (The school also prepared for the fall by buying $5 million in plexiglass to install across campus.)(PHOTO: PURDUE)\u201cI had a huge moral struggle trying to decide whether or not to come go back to school,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cThe science very obviously points out that it isn\u2019t safe to open, but Purdue pushed and pushed to open back up.\u201dFurthermore, remote learning would be particularly difficult for students like Bryce: \u201cLast semester, I was supposed to learn how to weld but the lab was cancelled due to COVID.\u201d And while most of his fall classes are online, he has \u201ca lot of hands-on classes that require me to go into labs.\u201d Classes start on August 24.And even while being personally vigilant, Bryce understands the risk.\u201cIf other students don\u2019t have the same sense of responsibility once classes start, I will start to worry,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople let up on precautions because of a false sense of security. Everyone just needs to be more aware of how real the virus is and how unforgiving it can be.\u201d\u2014Aarthi Swaminathan is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering education.
