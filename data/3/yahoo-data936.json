Aller/Getty Images)\u2018Students\u2019 ability to take responsibility both for themselves and each other\u2019Generally, the waiver forms note two things: That there is a risk of contracting the coronavirus if a student appears on campus and that the decision to come back cannot be held against the school.\u201cI know the challenge these circumstances present, but I also know our students\u2019 ability to take responsibility both for themselves and each other,\u201d Damon Sims, vice president for Student Affairs at Penn State, said in a press release. \u201cIf ever there was a time for them to do so, now is that time. We will do all we can to encourage that outcome, and we expect them to do all they can to make it so. We are in this together.\u201dStudents returning to Penn State\u2019s University Park campus, which usually houses more that 45,000 undergraduate students, are required to fill out the following \u201ccoronavirus compact\u201d prior to their arrival on Penn State\u2019s campus(SCREENSHOT: Penn State)(SCREENSHOT: Penn State)\u2018This is the reality of the current situation\u2019Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire is another college asking its students to sign a waiver.The liberal arts school is planning to conduct its fall semester primarily in-person, an option 30% of schools have chosen. Classes start for 2,000 students on August 19, university spokesperson Paul Pronovost told Yahoo Finance.Story continuesAside from the usual safety measures \u2014 from reducing density in housing, classroom, and common spaces, restricting visitors, implementing distancing \u2014 the school is also going to administer two coronavirus tests on students upon their arrival: A rapid test and a fuller test. Saint Anselm is also planning to do surveillance testing throughout the semester.(PHOTO: Saint Anselm College Flickr)Beyond social distancing, testing, and contact tracing, the university wants students and parents to \u201caccept\u201d the unique schooling situation.There\u2019s \u201csimply no way for the College \u2013 or any College or institution, for that matter \u2013 to guarantee that our campus will not see cases of COVID-19,\u201d Pronovost said in an email. \u201cWe believe it is important for students and families to understand and accept that this is the reality of the current situation.\u201dThe liability waiver notes that students \u201cforever release and waive my right to bring suit against Saint Anselm College, its Board of Trustees, officers, directors, managers, officials, agents, employees, or other representatives in connection with exposure, infection, and/or spread of COVID-19 related to taking classes, living or participating in activities on the Saint Anselm College Campus.\u201dColleges fear an avalanche of lawsuits The possibility of lawsuits worried colleges enough to lobby Congress for protections from liability.Nearly 80 education groups sent a letter to congressional leaders back in May, stating that reopening schools involves not just \u201cenormous uncertainty about COVID-19-related standards of care\u201d but also the \u201ccorresponding fears of huge transactional costs associated with defending against COVID-19 spread lawsuits.\u201dRutgers Law Professor Adam Scales argued that we may see an uptick in litigation, at least \u201cuntil Congress or the courts firmly signal that COVID is not going to be \u2018the new asbestos,\u2019\u201d adding that courts will not likely impose severe liability on public entities like schools.\u201cJust because a student can get into court does not mean the student can win,\u201d Michael Duff, a law professor at the University of Wyoming, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cSo even if the waiver does not \u2018work,\u2019 and the student can get into court, there is no guarantee that a lawyer would take the case because the case may be weak.\u201d(PHOTO: Saint Anselm College Flickr)There is also the issue of proof.\u201cThe idea that liability \u2014 whether caused by negligence or gross negligence \u2014 is easy to prove is a myth,\u201d Duff said. \u201cThe student would first have to prove that the college did not act \u2018reasonably\u2019 in the COVID-19 context.\u201dGiven that the definition of acting \u201creasonably\u201d would not necessarily involve a college being perfect with its coronavirus mitigation, Duff added, gross negligence would be \u201ca very hard thing to prove.\u201dAt the same time, Scales added, a liability waiver could not serve as a \u201cget-out-of-jail-free card\u201d a school taken to court in a coronavirus-related case brought by a student.\u2018A stark dilemma\u2019At the end of the day, McClure noted, colleges need students to return to campus and pay tuition to survive as institutions of higher education.\u201cI do genuinely believe that many institutions and the people running them want to do what's right and keep people healthy,\u201d McClure said. \u201cOn the other hand, there are the financial realities of attempting to keep an organization up and running, and an organization whose revenue is often very much tied to people coming to campus.\u201dSchools are thus faced with \u201ca stark dilemma,\u201d McClure added, of either bringing students and faculty back to campus or \u201cmake significant cuts because we are not able to pay our bills.\u201dStudents on the Stony Brook University's Long Island campus wearing protective masks on March 11, 2020. (Photo by John Paraskevas Newsday RM vis Getty Images)That said, given that students are paying a lot more today than previous generations in terms of tuition and fees, there is a sentiment that \u201cinstitutions actually have a greater duty of care to their students.\u201dThat idea is being put to the test amid the coronavirus pandemic, McClure said, and the liability waivers \u2014 which essentially abandon the \u201cduty of care\u201d that these institutions should take \u2014 fly in the face of this \u201cconsumerist moment\u201d in higher education.\u201cAnytime that you've got people that are forking over large amounts of money and making a significant investment,\u201d McClure said, \u201cyou can expect that they're going to want a certain level of service and are going to be unhappy when a company or an organization isn't delivering their end of the deal.\u201d\u2014Aarthi Swaminathan is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering education.
