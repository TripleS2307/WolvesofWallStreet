Moreover, 41% of Netflix users plan to keep their subscriptions after the pandemic \u2014 a higher retention rate than any other service, according to a survey of 1,000 Americans released by Piper Sandler on Aug. 25.The strong performance prompted billionaire value investor Mario Gabelli \u2014 who rose to prominence in the 1980s for savvy trading of media and telecom stocks \u2014 to call a missed opportunity on Netflix \u201cone of my great mistakes.\u201dGabelli, the chief executive and chairman of investing giant GAMCO, said in an interview on Aug. 25 that the firm holds a small stake in Netflix; but he regrets passing up a chance to buy shares when they fell after the company announced one of the increases in the price of its monthly subscription that it has imposed in recent years.\u201c[Netflix CEO] Reed Hastings raised the price, the stock dropped,\u201d Gabelli recalls, noting that now: \u201cNetflix is doing very well.\u201dThe company has raised the price of its monthly subscription a handful of times since its first rate hike in 2014, but it was not clear to which increase Gabelli referred. Netflix now offers tiered pricing at monthly rates of $8.99, $12.99, and $15.99 \u2014 the more expensive options allow a subscriber to stream on additional screens at once.Meanwhile, Disney Plus costs $6.99 per month, and Hulu charges a monthly fee of $5.99 or $11.99 for an ad-free version. Cheaper alternatives include Apple TV Plus at $5 per month and Peacock, which offers among other tiers a limited free option.Over the past year, Netflix has faced a slew of new competitors in streaming, including Disney Plus, HBO Max, Peacock, and Apple TV. Plus, Hulu has sought to bolster its position through new original programming and a site redesign, and Amazon Prime remains formidable with hits like \u201cFleabag,\u201d which snagged six Emmy Awards last year.Story continuesIn outlining the keys to success for streaming platforms, Gabelli emphasized the quality of a service\u2019s programming and its global reach.\u201cContent is still very important,\u201d he says. \u201cToday, however, availability of packaging that content is center road.\u201d\u201cOver the next five years, it's going to be, who can make it? Who can deliver it? And who can give it to the consumer globally?\u201d he adds.The surge in Netflix subscribers over Q2 brought its total subscribers worldwide to about 193 million. By comparison, Disney Plus had 60.5 million subscribers worldwide as of Aug. 3 \u2014 though the platform has operated for a far shorter time, having launched last November.Mario Gabelli, founder, chairman, and CEO of Gabelli Asset Management Company, speaks during an interview with Maria Bartiromo on Fox Business Network in New York, U.S., March 23, 2018.
