But some students are expressing concerns of their own.\u201cI think that\u2019s terrifying to me, going back to like a classroom with my fears in a world and just trying to get through the year,\u201d Jasmine Jovel, a recent high school graduate from Chelsea, Mass., said during a discussion with middle and high school students in the Massachusetts area held by Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (D-MA). \u201cBut with that ongoing fear that no matter how safe we\u2019re trying to be, there\u2019s still that chance that we can get the virus and people go home and they go to work and they interact with so many other people that we\u2019re not aware of.\u201dBoth of Jovel\u2019s parents had contracted COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, and she was concerned about whether her, or even her younger sibling attending first grade, would pick the virus up and bring it back home.(SCREENSHOT: Zoom call with Rep. Ayanna Pressley)Another student worried that the impact of staggered classes would compromise her ability to look after her younger sibling in school.\u201cI have a younger brother and I know one of the plans were to do \u2014 people whose last name started with A through M, go in the beginning of the week \u2026 and N through Z at the end of the week, [but] personally for my family that wouldn\u2019t work because me and my younger brother have different last names and there wouldn\u2019t be anyone to take care of him when I\u2019m out of school,\u201d Emanuelly Fernandes, a high schooler from Everett, Mass., told the listening session.\u201cI usually pick up my younger brother at school and he goes with me places,\u201d Fernandes added. \u201cSo if it was to split up or do hybrid, like half online, half in school, it would be difficult personally for my family.\u201dSecond grade teachers wearing masks meet at Freedom Preparatory Academy as they begin to prepare to restart school after it was closed in March due to COVID-19 on August 5, 2020 in Provo, Utah.

The school has been open since July 20.In Georgia, a second-grade student was found to have tested positive for COVID-19, leading the school to put exposed students under a two-week quarantine. And Georgia\u2019s largest school district is facing questions about lax safety protocols.A counselor talks with a disappointed camper during the Crossroads at BCYF summer youth programs at the BCYF Condon Community Center in Boston, MA on July 17, 2020.

Some of these recommendations include frequently cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces, and implementing social distancing, cloth face coverings, and more.But as of August 5, according to Education Week\u2019s tracker, 12 of the 15 largest school districts are choosing remote learning.Children under 10 years old (who do not have underlying medical conditions) are at lower risk for contracting COVID-19, according to early studies of the virus, and generally show lighter symptoms if infected.As of July 21, the CDC reports that in America, 6.6% of confirmed U.S. cases and less than 0.1% of COVID-related deaths are among those less than 18 years old.But children between the ages of 10 to 19 transmit the coronavirus much like adults, one study of 5,706 COVID-19 patients from South Korea found, raising the risk for school staff.An NAACP volunteerposts coronavirus awareness posters at Madison Park Technical Vocational High School in Boston, MA on August 01, 2020.

Even though he was recovering from the virus and Gould\u2019s family was taking care of him, the man passed away.\u201cThat has been a shock on our whole family,\u201d Gould shared.For sixth grader Brown from Boston, coronavirus hit even closer to home, an experience which has left an indelible mark on her.\u201cMy brother contracted COVID-19 and it made me feel sad,\u201d Brown recalled. \u201cI cried for two days, but when I heard that he was getting better, and that he [was in] quarantine, I was hoping that it would just get better.\u201d\u2014Aarthi Swaminathan is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering education.
