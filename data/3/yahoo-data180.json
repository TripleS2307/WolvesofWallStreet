Tech shares mostly shook off last week\u2019s jitters.[Click here to read what\u2019s moving markets heading into Tuesday, September 15]AstraZeneca (AZN) announced over the weekend that its late-stage Covid-19 vaccine trials with the University of Oxford had resumed, after safety concerns over a suspected adverse reaction from a participant had led the company to pause trials temporarily a week earlier. Shares rose about a 0.5% in early trading.Elsewhere, Oracle (ORCL) shares rose after the company on Monday confirmed reports that it was included in a proposal for TikTok that the social media owner\u2019s ByteDance submitted to the US Treasury Department over the weekend. This followed reports from multiple news outlets that the tech company landed a partnership with TikTok\u2019s US business unit, edging out Microsoft (MSFT), which had previously been viewed as the frontrunner for a tie-up with the fast-growing social media company. Microsoft shares ticked lower in pre-market trading, extending losses from Friday.\u201cGlobal markets are kicking off the week on an optimistic footing, with M&A activity and vaccine developments helping to lift spirits after recent declines,\u201d Josh Mahony, senior market analyst at IG, wrote in an email Monday.The development between Oracle and TikTok \u201cdoes help ease friction between the US and China, yet there will be questions over just how much data remains available to the main entity,\u201d he added. \u201cOn the vaccine front, news that the AstraZeneca vaccine trial is to resume provides a significant boost after fears that complications with one participant could represent a significant hurdle to development. With Trump telling states to expect a vaccine before the election, there is a feeling that we are in the home straight in the push for an effective treatment.\u201dStory continuesOther major corporations also announced massive new deals over the weekend. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) announced it was purchasing SoftBank Group\u2019s chip unit Arm Limited in a transaction valued at $40 billion \u2013 the largest ever in the semiconductor industry. Elsewhere, Gilead Sciences (GILD) agreed to purchase Immunomedics (IMMU) in an about $21 billion deal, adding the latter\u2019s tumor-fighting drugs to the pharmaceutical giant\u2019s portfolio. Shares of Gilead rose slipped 1% in early trading, while Immunomedics\u2019 stock more than doubled.\u20144:04 p.m. ET: Stocks power higher as deal activity picks up; Tech shares push Nasdaq to a 1.9% advanceHere were the main moves in markets as of 4:04 p.m. ET:S&P 500 (^GSPC): +42.58 (+1.27%) to 3,383.55Dow (^DJI): +327.69 (+1.18%) to 27,993.33Nasdaq (^IXIC): +203.11 (+1.87%) to 11,056.65Crude (CL=F): -$0.02 (-0.05%) to $37.31 a barrelGold (GC=F): +$19.30 (+0.99%) to $1,967.20 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): +0.2 bps to yield 0.6710%\u20141:49 p.m. ET: Stocks hold higher in intraday trading; American Express, UnitedHealth lead gains in the DowThe three major indices held higher in intraday trading Monday, with the real estate and health-care sectors leading to the upside in the S&P 500.

Last week, the Nasdaq dropped more than 10% over three sessions, as crowding in tech stocks from earlier on during the pandemic period quickly unwound.\u201cCurrent expectations that technology stocks will remain under pressure for some time seem exaggerated to us,\u201d Stoltzfus said in a note. \u201cWhile some technology stocks have gotten overvalued (the high flying names \u2013 particularly relatively new companies that soared to prices and multiples that seemed lofty) the core of technology stocks did not appear terribly rich in price considering that developments in technology and innovation have yet to show signs of plateauing in the current cycle. If anything technology has served to keep many segments of the economy not just alive but vibrant during an unprecedented shutdown of large segments of the US and world economies.\u201d\u201cOur expectations are for technology to lead in serving companies in the other ten sectors once the spread of Covid-19 is stemmed and the domestic and international economies move toward global expansion. We also expect technology to continue to benefit from a virtuous upgrade cycle from consumers,\u201d he added.Stoltzfus added that the firm\u2019s prior 2020 target price of 3,500 on the S&P 500 remains in suspension until further earnings visibility comes into relief. Oppenheimer remains overweight US equities, \u201cwhile maintaining meaningful exposure to both developed and emerging markets on expectations that an economic recovery stateside coming out of the Covid-19 shutdown will help boost economic growth around the world and lead to a global economic expansion.\u201d\u201410:15 a.m. ET: Oracle confirms it was included in proposal from ByteDance to US TreasuryOracle confirmed that ByteDance had included the company in a proposal for social media company TikTok over the weekend.\u201cOracle confirms Secretary Mnuchin's statement that it is part of the proposal submitted by ByteDance to the Treasury Department over the weekend in which Oracle will serve as the trusted technology provider,\u201d the company said in a statement.\u20149:40 a.m. ET: Oracle shares halted for news pending Oracle shares were halted shortly after market open Monday morning, for pending news. The company over the weekend was reported to have won a deal for TikTok\u2019s US operations, with the tie-up likely set to be structured as a corporate restructuring rather than full purchase.\u20149:32 a.m. ET: Stocks open higher, tech stocks regain footingHere were the main moves in markets, as of 9:33 a.m. ET:S&P 500 (^GSPC): +31.76 points (+0.95%) to 3,373.64Dow (^DJI): +173.55 points (+0.63%) to 27,839.19Nasdaq (^IXIC): +153.55 points (+1.41%) to 11,003.34Crude (CL=F): -$0.17 (-0.46%) to $37.16 a barrelGold (GC=F): +$17.40 (+0.89%) to $1,965.30 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): -1.1 bps to yield 0.656%\u20147:19 a.m. ET Monday: Stock futures rise as vaccine, M&A developments draw focusHere were the main moves in markets, as of 7:19 a.m. ET:S&P 500 futures (ES=F): 3,3374.00, up 40.25 points or 1.21%Dow futures (YM=F): 27,850.00, up 238.00 points or 0.86%Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): 11,241.5, up 180.00 points, or 1.63%Crude (CL=F): -$0.11 (-0.29%) to $37.22 a barrelGold (GC=F): +$4.00 (+0.21%) to $1,951.90 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): +0.7 bp to yield 0.674%A trader working on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is reflected on a monitor in Manhattan in New York, U.S., October 10, 2018.
