The company pinned the blame on the COVID-19 pandemic and uncooperative insurers who were supposed to help provide the company with fiscal support during tough times.Bankrupt J.C. Penney, meanwhile, received a bailout today from landlords Simon Property Group and Brookfield. The consortium valued the century old department store \u2014 which went bust back in May \u2014 at some $1.75 billion. A total of 650 stores will stay open, down from the more than 1,000 pre-pandemic.The sign outside the J.C. Penney store is seen in Westminster, Colorado February 20, 2009. (REUTERS/Rick Wilking)\u201cIt takes a long time to kill a retailer,\u201d Forrester retail analyst Sucharita Kodali told Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade when asked about J.C. Penney. \u201cSo as long as they are able to pay their bills, which if they have an owner they will \u2014 they can absolutely be around. But that doesn\u2019t mean death for J.C. Penney is totally off the table.\u201dKodali added that J.C. Penney \u201cmay not be a great customer experience, but at least it\u2019s alive and open. They can figure out what the plan B over five to ten years could be for that space.\u201dJ.C. Penney joins the likes of Macy\u2019s, which essentially mortgaged its future by raising $4.5 billion in financing in a bid to survive the year as 2020 ravaged sales.\u201cI don\u2019t think J.C. Penney has a long-term future. I\u2019m not so sure whether Macy\u2019s has a long-term future,\u201d former Sears Canada CEO turn Columbia Business School professor Mark Cohen previously told The First Trade. \u201cI think the occupants of those B and C malls \u2014 the specialty stores that congregate the concourses that are increasingly vacant \u2014 may not have a future. We\u2019re seeing an enormous number of store closings being announced \u2014 and even from the successful chains like Zara. So I think the breakage will be extraordinary and we\u2019re seeing the first signs of it.\u201dStory continuesThe Macy's flagship store is seen boarded up after a night of violent protests and looting in Midtown, Manhattan on June 2, 2020 in New York City.

Consequently, it\u2019s reasonable to expect malls and stores are shutdown.\u201cI think many of these companies will file [for bankruptcy], and it\u2019s not a handful. It\u2019s several dozen. And that\u2019s a scary number,\u201d Stifel managing director Michael Kollender, who leads the consumer and retail investment banking group for the firm, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cIt\u2019s far more than we have seen over the last several years combined.\u201dKollender and his colleague James Doak at Miller Buckfire \u2014 Stifel\u2019s restructuring arm, where Doak is co-head \u2014 have worked on dozens of consumer and retail bankruptcies in recent years, including Aeropostale, Gymboree and Things Remembered.\u201cWe will see some major chains go away and not come back,\u201d Kollender added. \u201cThese are chains that were struggling before the situation. COVID-19 will put them over the ledge.\u201dConfirmed coronavirus cases. (David Foster/Yahoo Finance)The pandemic has already toppled several household names. Stein Mart, a 112-year-old discounter, filed for bankruptcy in early August and will look to close most of its nearly 300 stores. The company cited significant financial stress brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic for its decision.August also saw Lord & Taylor \u2014 the oldest U.S. department store founded in 1826 \u2014 file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after being crippled by COVID-19 store closures. The company was purchased for $100 million from Hudson\u2019s Bay by fashion startup Le Tote in 2019. Le Tote also filed for Chapter 11.Men\u2019s Wearhouse-owned Tailored Brands also filed for Chapter 11 in August, too. The company said it had received $500 million in debtor-in-possession financing from existing lenders.Meantime, Ascena Retail Group, the owner of Ann Taylor and Lane Bryant, finally filed for bankruptcy protection in late July. The company, which has been circling the bowl for years, will look to the courts to help it shave $1 billion in debt. But it\u2019s likely the retailer will be far slimmer post bankruptcy than its current 2,800 store count.Regional retailer Paper Store filed for Chapter 11 in July as well. The operator of 86 stationary and card stores in the Northeast said it\u2019s looking for a buyer.Retail bankruptcies 2020New York & Co. parent company RTW Retailwinds also filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July after years of growing irrelevance in malls. The women\u2019s apparel company \u2014 which changed its name to the bizarre RTW Retailwinds as part of a rebranding in 2018 \u2014 operates 378 outlet and and mall-based stores across 32 states. It may close all of its stores as part of the filing.\u201cThe combined effects of a challenging retail environment coupled with the impact of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic have caused significant financial distress on our business, and we expect it to continue to do so in the future. As a result, we believe that a restructuring of our liabilities and a potential sale of the business or portions of the business is the best path forward to unlock value. I would like to thank all of our associates, customers, and business partners for their dedication and continued support through these unprecedented times,\u201d said RTW Retailwinds CEO Sheamus Toal in a statement.Indeed it has been a brutal time for retail amidst the pandemic.Brooks Brothers filed for bankruptcy in July. It has been dealt a twin blow to its finance from closed malls and a shift away from preppy clothing. The company would up being sold to the duo of Authentic Brands Group and Simon Property Group for $325 million.GNC has walked through death\u2019s door after knocking on it for years. The 85-year-old vitamin seller filed for bankruptcy in late June after years of battling waning sales and a debt load north of $1 billion. GNC plans to shutter up to 1,200 stores across the U.S. The company operates more than 5,800 stores.A person wears a protective face mask outside the GNC store as the city continues Phase 4 of re-opening following restrictions imposed to slow the spread of coronavirus on August 7, 2020 in New York City. (Photo: Noam Galai/Getty Images)2020 is shaping up to be one of the deadliest ever for the former icons of the mall and various shopping centers. The pandemic has kept stores closed for months and sent sales for the sector into a tailspin.With consumers only slowly venturing back out to stores after months of being quarantined, retailers are being faced with the reality they need fewer stores open \u2014 or should no longer be in business at all.\u201cSome companies are just not going to survive this,\u201d says McGrail, who is the COO of one of the world\u2019s largest asset disposition and valuation firms, Tiger Capital Group. Its McGrail\u2019s team \u2014 which often includes store associates of a stricken retailer \u2014 that hangs the \u201cEverything must go\u201d signs and works to fetch top dollar on fixtures and other inventory.Such is the current life for McGrail and others in the retail bankruptcy and restructuring fields. In talking to a host of experts, one thing is abundantly clear: more retail bankruptcies are very likely over the next twelve months.And while bankruptcies from Stein Mart, Lord & Taylor, RTW Retailwinds, Ascena and Brooks Brothers are headline makers, the fact is we haven\u2019t seen a stronger uptick in bankruptcies just yet for several reasons.A pedestrian walks past the Lord and Taylor store in Boston on Aug. 4, 2020. Lord and Taylor, filing for bankruptcy, plans to close two Boston-area stores. (Photo: Jessica Rinaldi/The Boston Globe via Getty Images)First, preparing for a structured entry into bankruptcy typically takes two to three weeks. Retailers were only thrust into mass social distancing driven store closures in mid- to late-March. Most held out hope they would reopen stores in April, which pushed off bankruptcy planning. Second, even the worst positioned big name retailers still had enough cash on hand to move through April and May (especially with workers furloughed) \u2014 that allowed executives to consider all options besides a headline-grabbing bankruptcy.And lastly, one of the benefits of a retailer filing for bankruptcy is to raise cash for creditors by holding store closing sales. That couldn\u2019t happen with state mandated store closings.\u2018We are in a retail tsunami,\u2019 and it has only just begunMost experts expect some degree of chaos to ensue even as retailers reopen their stores.Thousands of stores across the country right now are still sitting on badly aged inventory inside of their closed \u2014 or reopened \u2014 stores. That dust-collecting stuff is being sold at fire-sale prices \u2014 the problem is that everyone in retail is doing the same exact thing, leaving retailers to earn a horrific return on that inventory investment.Next up, retailers stand to get hammered by offering deep holiday deals in the hopes of bringing in cash flow. It\u2019s a true death spiral for retailers.A man walks past a Zara store on March 18, 2015. (REUTERS/Susana Vera)Store liquidations and their rock bottom prices for merchandise, meanwhile, will pressure efforts by stronger chains to get their businesses going. That will make relatively strong retailers far less strong.For those retailers seeking to emerge from bankruptcy, vendors are likely to be tepid to ship them product while at the same time tightening payment terms.That one-two punch usually kills a wounded retailer for good.Then there is the general uncertainty on how people will view going back to the mall in the new normal of social distancing. That fog of war is poised to persist well beyond the coming holiday season.\u201cWe are in a retail tsunami,\u201d Kollender said.This story was originally published on June 24, 2020, and has been updated.Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
