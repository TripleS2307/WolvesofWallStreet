We just frankly didn\u2019t open in the right way. Didn\u2019t embrace key public health principles and are paying the price for it right now.\u201dCoronavirus cases keep climbing outside the U.S. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)\u2018An absence of leadership\u2019Houston and Austin are both seeing major surges in hospitalizations, so much so that ICU bed usage is almost at full capacity in Houston.Gandhi, who is also running for the Democratic nomination in Texas\u2019s 10th congressional district, blamed it on \u201can absence of leadership\u201d at the federal and state level.\u201cWhen this whole thing started, the governor in Texas turned to local cities and said \u2018Hey, y\u2019all make your own choices to do what\u2019s safe for the folks in your city,\u2019\u201d Gandhi said. \u201cAnd Austin did. They canceled a major event, South by Southwest. Houston canceled major events.\u201dA rider gets thrown in the men's bull riding competition during the first day of competition of the Mesquite Championship Rodeo at Mesquite Rodeo Arena on June 6, 2020 in Mesquite, Texas. (Photo: Omar Vega/Getty Images)But then as things moved along, he added, \u201cthe governor wanted to take that control back. As cases worsened, the governor again is letting that go. So in this absence of leadership, folks really don\u2019t know what to do. And whether this comes down to mandating masks statewide or whether it comes to schools not knowing how to open, what to do, what metrics to follow, there is literally no major guideline helping businesses and schools figure out what the basic steps are to open in a way that\u2019s safe for the folks that use those services.\u201dTexas had entered phase three of reopening prior to this uptick in cases, which allowed all businesses to reopen at 50% capacity. Although the state had not been experiencing as many coronavirus cases as other parts of the country at the time, public health experts warned that if they lifted restrictions too soon, it could lead to disaster.Story continues\u201cI think that folks don\u2019t quite understand what\u2019s happening,\u201d Gandhi said. \u201cWe are all becoming numb to these numbers and metrics. We have a record number of hospitalizations, record number of ICU beds used in Houston and in Austin. But folks are used to hearing that and therefore not responding in a way that is equivalent.\u201dCoronavirus cases in the U.S. (David Foster/Yahoo Finance)\u2018Mostly vulnerable\u2019 Americans most at riskGov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) drew criticism after he implied that the rise in coronavirus cases was attributed to the high number of \u201coverwhelmingly Hispanic\u201d day laborers and agriculture workers.And federal officials are reportedly looking into whether Mexican migrants could be carrying the disease across the border.But Gandhi hit back at that notion, stating that it had more to do with socioeconomic inequalities than anything else.Bodega manager Rafael Perez wears a homemade face protector, fashioned from a water bottle, as he works in the Chinese Hispanic Grocery during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City, New York, U.S., April 2, 2020. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly\u201cLet\u2019s be upfront about what the president and the people that enable him want to do,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to point to border states, point to the increased cases in the Hispanic population, and tie a direct line to immigration to this country, and therefore pass policies similar to what the president did a couple days ago to limit immigration. ... The reality is this: In places like Austin, the Hispanic diaspora bears a disproportionate burden because when folks have to go back to work \u2014 in restaurants, service and hospitality, construction \u2014 it is people of color that overwhelmingly work those jobs here and don\u2019t have the luxury to take off time like folks that are White, Asian, or elsewhere.\u201dA report from the Commonwealth Fund found that counties with large black populations have faced higher case counts of coronavirus, higher mortality, and a faster pace of progression compared to counties with low black populations.The South is particularly vulnerable to the coronavirus. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)\u201cIt is mostly vulnerable Texans, mostly communities of color, folks who do not have a social safety net that are being pushed back to work, and because we haven\u2019t played the long game here, because we haven\u2019t invested in the social safety net, folks have an impossible choice to make,\u201d Gandhi said. \u201cGo to work sick, or stay at home and not get that paycheck. How do you afford food on the table? How do you get health care?\u201dAccording to the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), people of color \u2014 which includes Blacks, Latinos, and Asians, account for 43% of all essential workers, even though they make up only 39.1% of the population.\u201cThese disparities are the same disparities we\u2019re seeing in COVID,\u201d Gandhi said. \u201cIt has nothing to do with immigration. It has everything to do with our social, legal, and economic disparities when it comes to health in this country.\u201dAdriana is a reporter and editor covering politics and health care policy for Yahoo Finance.
