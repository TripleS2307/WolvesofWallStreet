The Dow added more than 400 points shortly before noon in New York. Airline, cruise line and lodging stocks rose as the prospects of at least some stimulus appeared back on the table. Shares of Eli Lilly (LLY) rose after the drugmaker announced it was seeking emergency use authorization from the FDA for its experimental Covid-19 antibody treatment.\u201cThe House & Senate should IMMEDIATELY Approve 25 Billion Dollars for Airline Payroll Support, & 135 Billion Dollars for Paycheck Protection Program for Small Business,\u201d Trump wrote in a Twitter post late Tuesday. \u201cBoth of these will be fully paid for with unused funds from the Cares Act. Have this money. I will sign now!\u201dTrump also added that he was \u201cready to sign now\u201d a standalone bill to send another round of $1,200 stimulus checks to taxpayers.Earlier Tuesday afternoon, Trump said in his Twitter posts that he instructed his representatives \u201cto stop negotiating until after the election,\u201d after which he expected to win and \u201cpass a major Stimulus Bill that focuses on hardworking Americans and Small Business.\u201dPreviously, investors had held onto slim hopes that lawmakers might succeed in passing another comprehensive fiscal stimulus package before Election Day on Nov. 3. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi held talks over the deal regularly over the past week, though the officials for months had failed to reconcile the discrepancies between their plans, which last stood at $2.2 trillion for House Democrats versus an about $1.6 trillion offer from Mnuchin.Even before Trump\u2019s announcement Tuesday afternoon, analysts at Eurasia Group said they believed passage of a pre-election stimulus package had an only 20% probability of transpiring, according to a research note Monday.Story continuesThe announcement came just hours after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell issued in a speech one of his firmest calls yet for lawmakers to advance fiscal stimulus to promote the economic recovery, saying that the rebound would be \u201cstronger and move faster if monetary policy and fiscal policy continue to work side by side to provide support to the economy until it is clearly out of the woods.\u201dElsewhere, Big Tech companies including Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) traded higher and shook off Tuesday\u2019s declines, after the House Judiciary\u2019s Antitrust Subcommittee released an about 450-page report describing these companies as having \u201cexpanded and exploited their power of the marketplace in anticompetitive ways.\u201d The report outlined a wide-reaching array of measures to try and curb these companies\u2019 power, which, if advanced into legislation, could eventually lead to breaking up parts of the companies\u2019 businesses.Still, some analysts said that it remains a reach for Congress in its current form to pose a meaningful threat to these corporations. However, a major shift of power to a Democratic majority in both chambers of Congress and the presidency post-election would raise the likelihood of more pressure, according to WedBush analyst Dan Ives.\u201cAbsent a legislative fix, we do not see meaningful change in regulation for now,\u201d Ives said in a note late Tuesday. \u201cWe likely do not see Congress agreeing on legislation unless both houses of Congress and the Presidency are controlled by the same party, as the parties have had difficulty reaching consensus on more pressing issues. However, a potential 'blue wave' in November would change the game on this front and make a formidable force going after antitrust law changes with breakups possibly on the radar.\u201d\u20144:05 p.m. ET: Dow gains 530 points, or 1.9%, to rise to the highest level in more than one monthHere were the main moves in markets as of 4:05 p.m. ET:S&P 500 (^GSPC): +58.50 (+1.74%) to 3,419.45Dow (^DJI): +530.70 (+1.91%) to 28,303.46Nasdaq (^IXIC): +210.00 (+1.88%) to 11,364.60Crude (CL=F): -$0.65 (-1.60%) to $40.02 a barrelGold (GC=F): -$18.80 (-0.98%) to $1,890.00 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): +4.3 bps to yield 0.7850%\u20142:15 p.m. ET: Federal Reserve says recovery could be \u2018slower than anticipated\u2019 in absence of future fiscal supportThe Federal Reserve released meeting minutes from its Sept. 15-16 meeting Wednesday afternoon, which shed more light on central bank officials\u2019 concerns that the economic recovery might be curbed in absence of further support from Congress.\u201cIndeed, many participants noted that their economic outlook assumed additional fiscal support and that if future fiscal support was significantly smaller or arrived significantly later than they expected, the pace of the recovery could be slower than anticipated,\u201d according to the meeting minutes.The minutes also revealed that Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants did not view the outcome-based forward guidance on rates that had been put forth in the last FOMC statement as \u201can unconditional commitment to a particular path.\u201d\u201cMost participants supported providing more explicit outcome-based forward guidance for the federal funds rate that included establishing criteria for lifting the federal funds rate above the ELB [effective lower bound] in terms of the paths for employment or inflation or both,\u201d according to the minutes. \u201cAmong the participants who favored providing more explicit forward guidance at this meeting, all but a couple supported a formulation in which the forward guidance included language indicating that it would likely be appropriate to maintain the current target range until labor market conditions were judged to be consistent with the Committee\u2019s assessments of maximum employment and inflation had risen to 2% and was on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.\u201d\u201cParticipants generally noted that outcome-based forward guidance for the federal funds rate of this type was not an unconditional commitment to a particular path,\u201d the minutes added.\u20141:20 p.m. ET: Trump has been \u2018symptom-free\u2019 for more than 24 hours, White House physician saysPresident Donald Trump has been \u201cfever-free for more than 4 days, symptom-free for over 24 hours, and has not needed nor received any supplemental oxygen since initial hospitalization,\u201d White House physician Dr. Sean Conley wrote in a memo Wednesday afternoon.The president has been out of the hospital since Monday evening, after being taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center late Friday and staying the weekend to be treated for Covid-19.\u201411:57 a.m. ET: Stocks extend gains, three major indices each advance more than 1%The three major indices added to gains in intraday trading Wednesday.
