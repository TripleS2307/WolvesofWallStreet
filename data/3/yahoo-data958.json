Nikola (NKLA), DraftKings (DKNG), Virgin Galactic (SPCE) all went public via SPAC mergers.\u201cWe\u2019re going to see a lot more of these,\u201d said Davidson. \u201cThese are alternative ways to get companies public.\u201dThis backdoor phenomena may be ripe for the times.\u201cWhen you have companies staying private for as long as you currently have, the expectation is at some point, you need to recapitalize the shareholder base, and enable those who have created that value to benefit from it,\u201d says Jose Cobos, CRO for Forge Global, an online trading platform for pre-IPO companies.\u201cThe reason I think SPACs have really done well is they are significantly faster to complete an IPO ... than a traditional IPO,\u201d said Cobos.Investors are often betting on the star executives behind the SPAC and their ability to identify profitable targets.This past week billionaire Bill Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square Tontine Holdings (PSTH.U) went public, raising a record $4 billion. Ackman says the blank check company aims to \u201cmarry a unicorn.\u201d\u201cIt's a much more efficient process, a much less risky process for the private company,\u201d Ackman told Yahoo Finance.SPACs can side-step market volatility, and the SPAC and target company avoid the intense scrutiny of traditional IPOs.IPO - Initial Public Offering - moment when company has debut on stock exchange market.

It\u2019s the traditional IPO approach\u2019Venture capitalist Bill Gurley recently tweeted that \u201cmassive underpricing\u201d of traditional IPO\u2019s have created a \u201chuge SPAC window.\u201dIn the past SPACs were considered costly because sponsors would often end up with 20% of the equity. Nowadays, that may be a cheaper option.\u201cRecently almost every one of these IPOs has had an 80% or 100% first day pop,\u201d says Davidson.Story continuesEarlier this month financial software company NCINO (NCNO) and insurance platform Lemonade (LMND) both soared more than 130% on their first day of trading.\u201cIf you compare what used to be an expensive SPAC, 20%, with a 100% under pricing of a public stock, who's got the bigger cost of capital? It\u2019s the traditional IPO approach,\u201d he added.\u2018A clever hack\u2019Another alternative to IPOs are direct listings, in which existing shareholders can sell their shares. Spotify (SPOT) and Slack (WORK) went public this way.[Read more: Don\u2019t say \u2018IPO\u2019: What to know about Slack\u2019s direct listing]The New York Stock Exchange is now pushing for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to allow companies to raise new capital during a direct listing. The SEC is expected to decide on the proposal this year.Even if the change isn\u2019t approved, Davidson points to \u201ca clever hack from Silicon Valley\u201d that also makes direct listings a more attractive alternative than IPOs.\u201cThe hack is a hybrid direct listing. Go raise a big private round, and then do the direct listing. That way you just separate raising money in the IPO from raising money separately, and you get the best of both worlds,\u201d he said.Its expected that data analytics firm Palantir and workplace toolmaker Asana will go public this year via direct listings.\u2018I would ask a really big question: Why did we screw up the IPO market?\u2019In the past, deals with blank check companies were seen as risky, raised eyebrows, and in some cases drew regulatory scrutiny.When asked if the SEC should start scrutinizing the rise of SPACs, Davidson replied: \u201cIf I were the SEC, I wouldn\u2019t worry about SPACs. I would ask a really big question. \u2018Why did we screw up the IPO market?\u2019\u201dGet the advanced data and expert fundamental analysis you can trust with Yahoo Finance Premium.
