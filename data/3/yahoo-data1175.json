Yet he argued against a top-down approach that would centralize decision-making in Washington.Amid searing critiques that the administration is faltering in its effort to control the outbreak, Adams said that \u201chonestly, nothing could be further than the truth. I'm working 24/7 and all the other doctors are working 24/7 to coordinate a federal response.\u201dUS has the biggest Covid outbreak in world we are now the driver of the global pandemic. Our response still lacks fundamental, basic elements: coherent leadership, focused programs, rapid turnaround time testing, effective contact tracing, consensus on masks, distancing.\u2014 Dr. Tom Frieden (@DrTomFrieden) July 19, 2020Adams voiced support for devolving control to states and localities, because that is where the resources are, he said.\u201cI used to run a State Department of Health for three years. It's important for people to understand that you can't do everything from Washington, D.C., but the majority of the work and the majority of the authority is at the state and local level within the public health systems,\u201d the physician said.\u201cAnd so what we're doing is working closely with state and local health departments,\u201d Adams added.Send in the troops?Story continuesOnly five states are seeing at least a 10% decline in cases. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)Adams argued that it would be impractical for the federal government to take on a leading role, using the presence of federal law enforcement in Oregon amid Black Lives Matter protests as an example.It\u2019s the same reason a federal mandate on masks is not possible, he stated, reiterating his opposition to a national policy on the issue.\u201cThis is a very practical concern, this isn't subjective,\u201d Adams told Yahoo Finance.\u201cThe difference between a mandate and a guideline is enforcement, and from a federal perspective, we can send in federal troops, and we see that's not working very well in places like Oregon right now,\u201d he added.Minorities disproportionately targeted by police also plays another role, said Adams, who has been a vocal advocate for attention on diversity issues.\u201cI\u2019m not against a mandate, but really against doing things without making sure people understand why they're doing them and working with the local communities,\u201d Adams said.\u201cI think that we can defeat this disease if we can get the public to do their part and we can get state governments and local governments and the federal government to all work together, and I'm seeing more and more of that,\u201d he added.Anjalee Khemlani is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
