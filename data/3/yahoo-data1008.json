But by the beginning of August, that number had dwindled: Now less than a quarter of schools are choosing to go the in-person route.College plans for the fall. (David Foster/Yahoo Finance)At the K-12 level, a list compiled by Education Week noted that most K-12 school districts are also playing it safe and opting for remote learning.In either case, the decision is extremely tough.\u201cIt\u2019s completely appropriate for school districts to take every precaution, to do blended learning, to give parents and educators options ... there are no risk-free scenarios here,\u201d former Education Secretary Margaret Spellings told Yahoo Finance\u2019s On The Move (video above). \u201cAnd as a part, and all of us as parents, we\u2019re going to have to weigh the benefits of education and socialization ... against the safety risk.\u201d\u2018College presidents are basically in an impossible situation\u2019The first and most important question that schools \u2014 both K-12 and higher education \u2014 are considering is whether to resume face-to-face learning while implementing public safety measures like social distancing and mask requirements when on campus.Large colleges like Purdue University and North Carolina State University decided that students will return to their campus. Liberty University, a private college in Lynchburg, Virginia, is also planning to be fully open on Aug. 24. Oklahoma State University is bringing students back between Aug. 1 and Aug. 17.Story continuesBut others are backing off in-person classes as cases continue to spike in certain parts of the country.Cases are popping up all across the country. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)Among colleges, one trend is clear: Colleges are taking careful steps, even backtracking when necessary, before fully reopening.Spelman College in Atlanta announced in July that its campus would be reopening for the fall. A few weeks later, Spelman decided to pivot to an entirely online model.Georgetown University also reversed course from its decision in early July, citing the \u201cacceleration of the spread of the virus and increasing restrictions on interstate travel\u201d as the reason why it \u201ccannot proceed with our original plans for returning to campus this fall.\u201dColleges that have made the decision to open up partially are coming up with various ideas for social distancing: In Texas, Rice University considered outdoor learning in tents as an alternative. (Students would have to bring their own portable chairs, and how these tent structures would be used and scheduled has yet to be determined.)\u201cWe are fortunate that our climate allows us to be outdoors for much of the academic year,\u201d the school stated. \u201cSo we are also purchasing five open-sided tents (40 x 60 ft.) and placing them adjacent to academic buildings.\u201dA student walks on the campus of Harvard University in Cambridge of Massachusetts, the United States, on July 14, 2020.

If they open up in person, there are serious health concerns, and they run the risk of protests and a vote of no-confidence.\u201dStudents are also making their voices heard in the reopening debate. One reporter noted that even though Harvard made plans for 40% of its undergrads to return to campus, only 25% will be coming back.Beloit College, a small private liberal arts school in Wisconsin, is slicing up the semester system, in case the pandemic gets worse and they need the flexibility.Beloit College campus, Beloit, Wisconsin. (PHOTO: Education Images/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)\u201cWe started thinking about the fall at the end of March,\u201d Eric Boynton, provost and dean of Beloit College, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cAnd over the space of April, we actually instituted some innovations about how to conduct our classes in the fall, and how to deliver our curriculum.\u201dThe 174-year-old Wisconsin-based school decided to shift from making students take 15-week semester-long classes to two modules: Students will take two classes in each module between September to October, and then two additional classes between October and December.\u201cAnd so what happens when we have these mods in the first semester,\u201d Boynton explained, \u201cis there's a hinge point, a natural point, which we could either pivot to or away from campus, in relationship to whatever COVID or the pandemic is up to.\u201dWhatever route schools end up choosing, the risk is clear: Even though the fall semester has yet to begin, a New York Times survey found 6,300 cases of COVID-19 tied to about 270 colleges from Austin to Philadelphia.A sign reminding people to wear face masks is seen in front of a library on Georgetown University's main campus in Washington, D.C., the United States, July 7, 2020. (Photo: Xinhua/Liu Jie via Getty Images)Test or no test?Decisions also vary on testing.At the University of Virginia, all graduate and undergraduate students who plan to return to the campus \u201cwill be required to submit a negative COVID-19 viral PCR test result\u201d to the college before they return, the school announced on its website.Purdue officials told ABC that they plan to test every one of their 40,000 students with saliva kits before the semester.The timing of how often to do the test also varies.Yale is planning twice-per-week testing for undergrads and anyone else living on campus. The University of Chicago stated more vaguely that testing would be \u201cupon their arrival and routinely throughout the year.\u201dSome schools have spelled out what will trigger another shutdown: Syracuse University stated that if more than 200 students contract coronavirus at the same time, the university will discontinue in-person instruction, a student reporter tweeted.Liberty also has a hard line: If 5% of its total on-campus population (including faculty and staff) contract coronavirus, the school will suspend in-person instruction as well. And if 15% become infected, the school will close the campus entirely and dismiss students.(Screenshot/ University of Texas at Austin)The University of Texas at Austin also has spelled out what will trigger five different levels of closure, with the number of deaths being a major factor to weigh.Beloit, on the other hand, is advising students to stay home and quarantine for 14 days prior to arriving on campus. But the school is also exploring batch testing and arranging classes such that students don\u2019t pass each other frequently on campus while also mandating mask wearing and health checks.Schools vs. collegesThough K-12 schools may not have the funds to match what these universities are doing, they do have some sort of rubric to follow when planning their reopenings.Looking at the \u201cdiscrepancy between what is happening at the university level ... and the measures that we're talking about societally as we think about reopening K through 12 schools ... it's important for people to understand what universities are talking about and what risk mitigation looks like at the level of the university,\u201d Sarah Fortune, chair of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health\u2019s department of immunology and infectious diseases, said on a press call this week.Fortune noted that efforts by these universities effectively could serve \u201cas a bar, that we should be striving for in our K to 12 schools.\u201dAnd particularly when it comes to testing, universities are \u201creally blanketing their communities with testing in order to open safely,\u201d she noted, adding that elementary and K-12 schools should also be thinking of doing similar measures.Harvard students at Harvard University premises in Cambridge, MA, July 08, 2020. (PHOTO: Anik Rahman/NurPhoto via Getty Images)Safety of staffThe other big issue schools are grappling with is whether teachers, faculty, and administration staff are comfortable returning to the campus.For instance, if a teacher or a professor feels that they are exposing themselves to unnecessary risk of contracting coronavirus by interacting with students face to face, can they refuse? And what happens if they can\u2019t?\u201cThat concern is justified, especially if you\u2019re in a hotspot,\u201d Spellings, who is now the CEO of non-profit Texas 2036, said.But ruling out face-to-face instruction across the entire American education system from kindergarten to colleges \u2014 i.e. another lockdown \u2014 is an \u201cill-conceived\u201d idea, she warned.A second grade teacher teaches online in her empty classroom on April 15, 2020 in Goshen, Kentucky. (PHOTO: Andy Lyons/Getty Images)For teachers and educators, Daniel Altchek, labor and employment partner at Saul Ewing Arnstein & Lehr, who regularly advises schools, said that these situations will be tricky.\u201cThere\u2019s a couple of vehicles where they can typically express those concerns\u201d about returning to work and possibly contracting the virus, he explained.For K-12 teachers, they can ask their union for support. The unions are very aware of this issue: On Tuesday, the second-largest teachers\u2019 union in the country announced that it was authorized to strike as a \u201clast resort\u201d measure if teachers fail to reach an agreement with state and federal authorities over safely reopening schools.For higher ed, it\u2019s a little more complicated.\u201cMost higher ed has sort of campus governance structures, such as the faculty senate, those types of bodies \u2026 where they do have a pretty strong voice on campus,\u201d Altchek explained. Concerns can be escalated to the administration, and there are also legal protections for faculty.In any event, directives from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) will play a key part in how employers deal with concerns.This is the one of the barriers against COVID-19 that the University of Georgia set up. pic.twitter.com/34MCpJEwGo\u2014 colette arrand (@colettearrand) August 6, 2020And whether or not all universities get some legislation that protects them from lawsuits from employees that say they contracted coronavirus is unclear. But he hasn\u2019t seen indications of an \u201cavalanche\u201d of lawsuits, he added.That assertion is true to an extent. Politico reported that lawsuits tracked by law firm Hunton Andrews Kurth found that out of the 3,727 coronavirus-related suits that have been filed since March, less than 5% fall into the \u201cpersonal injury\u201d category, i.e. plaintiffs claiming that they had exposed to coronavirus on the premises.Some schools are asking students to sign a liability waiver to protect themselves against litigation if students catch coronavirus on campus.Spellings noted that the lack of guidance from the federal level was definitely an issue.\u201cWhat are we going to do when the eventualities happen, with teachers becoming affected, and students ... do you close the entire school?\u201d she asked. \u201cDo you sequester for two weeks? How do you think about testing.\u201dAt the same time, going fully online or locking down again \u201cis really going to hurt a generation of students, especially those most at risk,\u201d Spellings said.A University of South Florida student on July 2, 2020 in Tampa, Florida. (PHOTO: Octavio Jones/Getty Images)\u2018Stiff headwinds\u2019Any path forward will be fraught with peril, experts said, especially for higher education.\u201cWe've had the higher education sector on a negative outlook for three years,\u201d Jessica Wood, higher education sector lead for S&P, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cThere's been pressure across the industry for several years, from a competitive standpoint, from an affordability standpoint and from an enrollment standpoint.\u201dThe pandemic will exacerbate those issues.\u201cWhen you add in COVID and the pressures that shelter-in-place directives have had on campuses, and then you add in the current recessionary environment, we do think it \u2014 and we\u2019ve been saying it for a couple of years \u2014 that it's likely that weaker institutions will face significant pressure in the coming year or two, and we will see more closures,\u201d Wood said.Back in Wisconsin, Boynton echoed those sentiments.\u201cThere are stiff headwinds facing this industry to be sure, no doubt about it,\u201d he said, before adding that \u201cthere is plenty of opportunity for colleges to find ways to not only survive, but thrive in this climate \u2014 but it will require all sorts of creative work.\u201d\u2014Aarthi Swaminathan is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering education.
