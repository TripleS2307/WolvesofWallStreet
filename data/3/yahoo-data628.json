Trump noted several times that 401(k) plans would be at risk if he weren\u2019t re-elected as president \u2014 it\u2019s likely to be a mantra used at length by Trump on the campaign trail as markets have shrugged off the COVID-19 pandemic and rallied back near record highs.A vote for Trump means a vote for you to have a fatter wallet, or so the president is hyping up.President Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally in Tulsa, Okla., Saturday, June 20, 2020. (AP Photo/Sue Ogrocki)Indeed, markets look to to be in the early stages of pricing in a Trump re-election (despite polls that show him trailing Biden), which theoretically would mean the extension of his signature corporate tax cuts and a continued focus on de-regulation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has surged 40% from the March 23 lows, while the S&P 500 has tacked on a similar amount. Moreover, a broader number of stocks have participated in the rally of late such as a consumer staple in Clorox and various industrials.And of course, high-flying tech names remain just that \u2014 high-flying. Netflix shares hit a new all-time high on Monday, according to Yahoo Finance premium data.As controversial as President Trump is, market pros would contend that these types of moves upward in equities wouldn\u2019t necessarily happen if the market was sniffing out the real possibility of a blue wave and higher taxes under a president Biden. There is still time for that pricing in to happen if Trump continues to stumble in the polls, but to Lee\u2019s point the market may simply view Trump as friendlier to one\u2019s investments and the economy at large and that sticking around for four more years.Story continues\u201cI do think for the overall economy, a Trump administration would benefit the masses more than those with financial assets,\u201d Lee adds.Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
