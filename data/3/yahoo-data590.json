But a resilient 2Q (demand and, likely, profit) is now making the company appear less risky/stronger financially,\u201d wrote Jonas in a note to investors.His previous bull case price target was $1,200.\u201cOur revised bull case of $2,070 is based on 6 million units of volume by 2030..as well as an EBITDA margin of 20%,\u201d wrote Jonas. The scenario \u201cwould place the company among the very best luxury car manufacturers to give them greater credit for mix and/or greater volumes of high margin software revenue.\u201dAnalysts have rushed to revise their calls as the stock blows past price targets. Tesla shares have risen 45% in the past six sessions. Jonas is maintaining his Underweight rating on the stock, while raising his price target from $650 to $740.In this Sunday, June 28, 2020, photograph, a long line of unsold 2020 Model Y sports-utility vehicles sits at a Tesla dealership in Littleton, Colo. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski)\u201cThe re-rating of the shares is happening with extraordinary speed, even by Tesla\u2019s own historic standards,\u201d writes Jonas. \u201cOver the past week, the company is adding to its valuation an amount roughly equal to Ford\u2019s (F) entire market cap on a daily basis. We\u2019re struggling to play catch-up here with the valuation.\u201dIn June, Jonas downgraded Tesla to Underweight and warned that investors were treating it too much like a tech company as shares surpassed $1000.In his latest note Jonas reiterates his long terms concerns which likely won\u2019t stop the rally near term.\u201cOur concerns around sustainability of profit in China, poor auto industry fundamentals, and what we believe to be inevitable competition in EVs and AVs from a host of well-capitalized tech firms (AMZN, AAPL, GOOGL, etc.) are just not seen by the market as a big enough part of the narrative for the remainder of 2020,\u201d he wrote.Story continuesGet the advanced data and expert fundamental analysis you can trust with Yahoo Finance Premium.
