Yet the slide also grouped pro-Trump and pro-police vernacular into a category listed as \u201cunacceptable,\u201d along with other \u201cpolitically affiliated slogans or materials.\u201dOn Wednesday, the president \u2014 locked in a fierce reelection battle against former Vice President and Democratic Nominee Joe Biden \u2014 lashed out at the tire maker, urging his followers to boycott its products, adding that \u201ctwo can play the same game, and we have to start playing it now!\u201dDon\u2019t buy GOODYEAR TIRES - They announced a BAN ON MAGA HATS. Get better tires for far less! (This is what the Radical Left Democrats do. Two can play the same game, and we have to start playing it now!).\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 19, 2020In response, Goodyear issued a statement saying the slide in question was \u201cnot created or distributed by Goodyear corporate,\u201d and was not part of its core diversity training. The company insisted the backlash was part of \u201cmisconceptions about our policies,\u201d and that it backs equality and law enforcement.Yesterday, Goodyear became the focus of a conversation that created some misconceptions about our policies and our company. Goodyear has always wholeheartedly supported both equality and law enforcement and will continue to do so. pic.twitter.com/oO6jUg2rTR\u2014 Goodyear (@goodyear) August 19, 2020The stock, traded on the New York Stock Exchange, briefly dropped by more than 2% before recovering lost ground after Goodyear issued its rebuttal.Story continuesTrump is no stranger to high-profile fights with public companies, and has been wont to lash out at corporations that adopt policies unfavorable to his political or policy objectives. With his poll numbers lagging, he\u2019s made explicit appeals to his political base in hopes of bolstering his support \u2014 which usually involves the use of highly-charged cultural issues.Most recently, the president has moved to block the viral video app TikTok in the U.S., citing national security concerns, and has pushed for the sale of its domestic operations to an American entity.In 2018, the president waded into a war of words with Harley Davidson (HOG), backing a boycott in response to the company relocating some operations to Europe. And in the early stages of the coronavirus crisis, he publicly lambased General Motors (GM) for not ramping up production of needed ventilator equipment, before ordering them to do so under the Defense Production Act (DPA).Javier David is an editor for Yahoo Finance.
