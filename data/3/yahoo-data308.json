As you may be aware, Bob Lighthizer the U.S. trade representative, was testifying before Senate Finance Committee yesterday. I am on that committee, and he was asked were you in the room at the time that this conversation supposedly took place, and Bob Lighthizer very adamantly insisted that he was in the room and no such conversation took place,\u201d Toomey said on Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade.A copy of \"The Room Where It Happened,\" by former national security adviser John Bolton, is photographed at the White House, Thursday, June 18, 2020, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)Toomey was responding to a question by Yahoo Finance on if he had lost confidence in the ability of the president to properly handle international trade negotiations. Bolton alleges in his 577-page book \u2018The Room Where it Happened\u2019 that Trump asked China president Xi to buy agricultural products in an effort to help his re-election. Farmers have long been Trump supporters. But, the two countries have been locked in a trade war going on two-plus years, so Bolton\u2019s comments have surprised many folks.Bolton also alleges improper handling by Trump of military aid to Ukraine.President Trump promptly took to Twitter on Thursday to refute Bolton\u2019s allegations.\u201cBolton\u2019s book, which is getting terrible reviews, is a compilation of lies and made up stories, all intended to make me look bad. Many of the ridiculous statements he attributes to me were never made, pure fiction. Just trying to get even for firing him like the sick puppy he is!,\u201d Trump tweeted. The president flat out told The Wall Street Journal on Bolton: \u201che\u2019s a liar.\u201dStory continues\u201cI think it would be a mistake to jump to a conclusion about one allegation, especially when it\u2019s being specifically refuted,\u201d Toomey added.Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
