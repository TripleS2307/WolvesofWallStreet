To be considered for the Dow, a stock must be a non-transportation or non-utility company in the S&P 500.The Dow, which dates back to the 19th century, is \u201cnot governed by quantitative rules,\u201d S&P Global, which runs both the Dow and the S&P 500, describes.The methodology is far more vague: \u201cA stock is typically added only if the company has an excellent reputation, demonstrates sustained growth and is of interest to a large number of investors.\u201dEven though the Dow is often second-fiddle to the S&P 500 in the financial world, it's on display here at the NYSE. (AP Photo/Richard Drew)Additional rules and considerations: it must be a company headquartered and incorporated in the U.S. and have a plurality of its revenue from the country, and a company must help the index maintain its desired exposure to the sector.Changes, S&P notes, are made as needed, not on any special schedule. And those changes are precipitated by market developments and corporate actions like spin-offs. They\u2019re also announced with little lead time, between one and five days before implementation.So, who decides how a company gets on?With far fewer rules than the S&P 500 and a qualitative approach, how does a company actually get added? In lieu of a checklist-type approach, companies are literally at the mercy of a bunch of people who decide whether a company\u2019s inclusion makes sense.On the Dow\u2019s committee, there are two representatives from The Wall Street Journal and three from S&P Global (up until last year, S&P\u2019s reps included one legendary stock-picker).Together, they decide after evaluating the prices and corporate actions and comparing the index to the broad market. For the Dow, share price matters because it\u2019s how the index is weighted. That\u2019s why Apple\u2019s position in the Dow dropped 3% after its recent 4-to-1 stock split \u2014 even though its market capitalization didn\u2019t budge.Story continuesOften, the committee will consider and evaluate other candidates, but this information stays confidential as getting into the Dow can be a huge boon for a company\u2019s stock price, just as getting kicked out is considered a blow.The qualitative and somewhat arbitrary nature of the Dow\u2019s blue chip companies has led to the index falling out of favor with many people in the financial world. (Scott Galloway recently told Yahoo Finance that it\u2019s one of the most \u201cdangerous numbers ever manufactured.\u201d) Not only does it have limited methodology, the Dow committee even has leeway to make exceptions.But despite all of that, the Dow has remained the go-to market metric for millions of Americans, consistently googled far more than the S&P 500 or any other index. And for companies, being included is a really big deal.\u2014Ethan Wolff-Mann is a writer at Yahoo Finance focusing on consumer issues, personal finance, retail, airlines, and more.
