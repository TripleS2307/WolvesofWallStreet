I'm prepared to sit down with the Speaker at any time to negotiate.\u201d He told Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-CA) that he would call House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) as soon as the hearing was over.The size of the relief package is still very much an issue, however. Mnuchin said he did not support the $2.2 trillion package proposed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), which was offered as a compromise position. Republicans have offered $1.3 trillion, but have shown no interest in going higher, and may not have solid internal support for any additional relief spending.Still, Mnuchin highlighted the areas where the two sides appear to agree. \u201cI believe a bipartisan agreement still should be reached,\u201d Mnuchin said, \u201cand would provide substantial funds for schools, testing, vaccines, PPP for small businesses, continued enhanced unemployment benefits, child care, nutrition, agriculture, and the U.S. Postal Service, along with liability protection for universities, schools, and businesses.\u201dSenate eyes \u201cskinny\u201d bill. Senate Republicans hope to introduce a slimmed down $500 billion coronavirus relief bill next week, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said Tuesday. The bill will be \u201cmore targeted\u201d than the $3.4 trillion package Democrats approved in the House, Meadows said, and would be constructed to pass on its own or serve as a starting point for a larger deal.Meadows said he met with President Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Monday and that the president told them \u201cto get as creative as we can within the confines of the law to put forth as much money as we can so we can keep this economy going.\u201dStory continuesPelosi has repeatedly rejected the idea of passing a \u201cskinny\u201d relief bill, though, and Senate Democrats are expected to prevent the GOP bill from getting a vote absent some kind of deal in place with the speaker.A major stumbling block. Meadows said aid for state and local governments is \u201cprobably the biggest stumbling block\u201d for the next round of negotiations. Pelosi has requested $915 billion in aid to help avoid layoffs of public workers including teachers, firefighters and police officers. But Republicans have rejected anything like that level of assistance for what they portray as spendthrift, Democratic-led states and cities.Even so, Mnuchin told lawmakers that the White House would back some kind of funding for states and local governments. \u201cNobody thinks the right outcome is zero,\" Mnuchin said.Like what you're reading?
