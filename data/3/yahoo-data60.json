Now, the builder is trying to pace itself as it fields record numbers of home orders.Homebuilders across the country sold homes at a record pace this summer, burning through their supply. To slow down the sales activity, homebuilders have started to restrain sales as they look toward preserving supply for 2021, according to economists.Read more: Buying a house: What you need to know about home ownership\u201cAt first, builders weren\u2019t being overly careful about holding back sales \u2014 they were just excited about how many homes they were selling. Then one day they woke up and said, \u2018This demand is real, it\u2019s sustainable and it\u2019s burning through our lots \u2014 which are really hard to replace,\u2019\u201d said Ali Wolf, chief economist at Meyers Research, a California-based housing market data firm.KB Home had a 27% increase in net orders this quarter, its highest sales pace since 2005. The spike in orders caused a 12% increase in backlogged orders and 7% fewer communities available for sale at the end of the quarter. During an investor call this week, the company said it expects \u201csignificantly higher backlog\u201d by the end of the year, and inventory won\u2019t rise until the second quarter of 2021.The company\u2019s order growth is in line with the overall market. New home sales reached a 14-year high in August, up 4.8% after a 13.9% jump in July, the Commerce Department said Thursday morning. And mortgage applications are up 25% compared to this time last year, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.Home renovation, repair and construction: isometric model house and tools with copy space\u201cWe are working to convert this backlog to deliveries, pacing our starts with our order rate,\u201d said Jeff Mezger, chairman, president and chief executive officer of KB Home, in an earnings call Tuesday. \u201cWe're not to sell them [houses] unless we can start and then close them. So we're pretty much in balance right now. Our starts are ramping up proportionate to the sales growth.\u201dStory continuesLow inventory levels have investors concerned. Cleveland-based KeyBanc Capital Markets\u2019 equity research team downgraded KB Home to sector Weight from Overweight, citing limited community (inventory) growth. KB Home shares fell 4% to $36.78 per share Thursday morning.Limited inventory is attributable to a pause in development during the coronavirus pandemic, plus renewed demand. KB Home plans to add 135 communities in 2021, \u201cthe highest annual number of openings in many years,\u201d said Mezger.\u201cOur sizable absorption rate [5.9 orders per community, compared to 4.3 per community at this time last year] contributed to selling through more communities than we had anticipated just three months ago,\u201d said Mezger.In earnings releases earlier this month, Lennar (LEN), Toll Brothers (TOL) and D.R. Horton (DHI) also reported a need to pace sales amid historic demand.\u201cThey [builders] did it [sold less] on purpose to be a long-term sustainable operation \u2014 not just on a sugar high,\u201d said Wolf.\u201cWe remain focused on managing the pricing incentives and sales pace in each of our communities to optimize the return on our inventory investments and adjust to local market conditions and new home demand,\u201d said Jessica Hansen, vice president of investor relations at D. R. Horton on the company\u2019s July 28 earnings call. The company projects steady or declining inventory in the fourth quarter.Not afraid to hike pricesHomebuilders are also hiking prices to match \u2014 and temper \u2014 rising demand. About 60% of builders raised prices in September compared to only 40% last year, according to a September 14-18 survey of 300 homebuilders by Meyers Research.\u201cWe will continue to balance that pace [of home sales] in prices\u2026 to maximize returns for both inventory and equity,\u201d said Hansen on D.R. Horton\u2019s earnings call.\u201cSales could have been stronger with a singular focus on volume, but instead we drove margin growth and cash flow,\u201d said Stuart Miller, chief executive officer of the Lennar Corporation on the company\u2019s September 15 earnings call. \u201cAccordingly, while managing sales pace, our margins have grown as demand has grown, and supply has remained limited.\u201dKB Home said during its earnings call that it plans to increase its average selling price to $415,000 in the fourth quarter from $385,000 in the third quarter. And Toll Brothers projects increasing average sales price to between $815,000 and $835,000 in the fourth quarter, compared to $805,000 in the third quarter.\u201cWe will be closely monitoring our ability to deliver houses in time frames that are acceptable to us. And if the production schedules extend because of those issues then we will more aggressively raise prices to manage those backlogs and manage the delivery dates,\u201d said Douglas Yearley, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of Toll Brothers, Inc. on the homebuilder\u2019s earnings call on August 26.Part of the reason for the hike is also that homebuilders are worried that the asking price today won\u2019t be competitive when they actually deliver the houses, due to fluctuating labor and supply costs.\u201cWe want to stay ahead of the cost moves for sure. And if the market allows it, we'd like to be able to price for that,\u201d said Matt Mandino, KB Home chief operating officer during the company\u2019s earnings call.\u201cIf builders sell a home today and it\u2019s not built yet, they might sell it at $400,000 with costs set at what they are today. But three months from now, the house is worth $430,000 and costs are up 10%. So they have hurt themselves by selling the home now when they can\u2019t build it till later,\u201d said Wolf.Price hikes come amidst a national affordable housing crisis, but builders aren\u2019t yet concerned about scaring buyers away with record asking prices. Almost 40% of builders said they are having \u201cno challenges\u201d in their operation even as they raise prices, according to Meyers Research.But economists say if builders keep increasing prices, homebuilders could reach a cliff down the line.\u201cIt\u2019s keeping me up at night because wages aren\u2019t going up that fast. I keep saying, \u2018This is unsustainable. You\u2019re going to push prices so high.\u2019 Rates are low and prices up \u2014 what challenge has this created? Majority of builders say \u2018nothing,\u2019 but that\u2019s today. That\u2019s fine, but in a year if you keep pushing prices, you\u2019re pricing people out. There\u2019s no way around that,\u201d said Wolf.Sarah Paynter is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
