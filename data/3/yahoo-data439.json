Bancel cited the additional $472 million\u2014 which brings total funding up to $955 million \u2014 as integral to accelerated push.\u201cAt the time we were thinking of a trial of 10,000 participants,\u201d Bancel said of the initial plan in April, adding that discussions with the government researchers resulted in settling on a 30,000 participant trial.Over the weekend, the company announced an additional round of funding from Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a department under the U.S. Health and Human Services Department (HHS).Moderna announced the first patient was dosed in Georgia with 100 micrograms of the vaccine candidate early Monday, but uncertainty remains as the trajectory of the outbreak determines how an effective vaccine is monitored and studied.As the coronavirus tightens its grip on the world, the stakes for Moderna \u2014 and a potential COVID-19 treatment \u2014 are high. Typically, the vaccine industry is not as profitable as therapies, and a treatment that falls short could be a devastating blow to a relatively young company.Moderna, in partnership with European-based Lonza, is producing at-risk 500 million doses for the year, and scaling up to potentially reach 1 billion doses by 2021.The mRNA vaccine technology the company is using has not yet been tested on the market, and production is more complex than traditional vaccines. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has set a bar of 50% efficacy of any vaccine, and will have to determine the technology\u2019s potential compared to traditional vaccines.Story continues\u2018We have to make a profit\u2019If successful, a vaccine will actually be the 10-year-old company\u2019s first product on the market. Despite significant taxpayer funding, as well as investors boosting its market capitalization to $29 billion, the biotech upstart will need to make a profit \u2014 and will consider that in its pricing, Bancel said.Exactly how much a vaccine shot will cost, and who\u2019ll ultimately cover it, remains a big sticking point in the process.\u201cWe have to make a profit out of the first product [we sell],\u201d Bancel told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe have invested $2 billion of our shareholder capital since we started the company. We need to get a return. We are highly aware this is a pandemic and we need to be very responsible on how we price a product.\u201dThe company has said they will use previous vaccine prices as a benchmark, and will be providing discounts during the pandemic phase.In a separate issue, questions have been raised over the company\u2019s executives selling stock after positive results from early trials. That pattern that has been seen in other newly-popular biotechs.Bancel reiterated the sales were set up in December 2018 after the company went public, but declined to address when or if the plans had since been modified. The company is in a silent period prior to second quarter earnings on August 5.\u201cWhat I can tell you 99% of my wealth is tied up in Moderna stock, so I\u2019m very aligned with any of our shareholders,\u201d Bancel said. \u201cI had more stock on June 13 than I had on January 1. If any investor is worried they are not aligned with me, they should look at the numbers.\u201dAnjalee Khemlani is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
