Shares surged 26% during Wednesdays session, back above the firm\u2019s price target of $45.\u201cWe believe the stock does not fully price in successful execution of the multi-year growth strategy, which yields earnings power of ~$1.7bn EBITDA in 2027,\u201d wrote Coster, the note\u2019s lead analyst.That analyst highlights a \u201cnumber of potential positive catalysts in coming weeks and months\u201d including the announcement of a partner to produce its Badger pick-up truck, deployment plans for hydrogen charging stations in the UK, and \u201cpotentially accelerated implementation plans for the FCEL truck in the U.S.\u201dThe electric and hydrogen fuel-cell truck company has been much-talked-about since its public debut in early June, with comparisons (and non-comparisons) to Tesla (TSLA). In a recent interview with Yahoo Finance Milton said he hopes to someday \u201ctake the throne\u201d from the Ford (F) F-150.Milton tweets regularly about designs and sneak-peeks and is often defending the company against nay-sayers.Want to see the Instagram live video? See the fuel cell, under the hood, powering the truck, driving, running along side of it and had a little fun poking at all the trolls saying we are fake. Hope you all enjoy!

Cowen last month initiated coverage of the stock with an Overweight rating and a price target of $79. Meanwhile RBC Capital gave it a lukewarm reception this week, with a Sector Perform rating and a price target of $46.Coster wrote that downside risks include that \u201cthe company is authorized to issue equity and is likely to do so (alongside debt) to fund growth of the business.\u201d The note also warns insiders may sell shares when the lock up expires.The stock has been highly volatile since it went public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (or SPAC) in early June. The stock reached an intraday high of $93.99 last month.[Read more: 'Robust pipeline' of companies set to come to markets: NYSE official]\u201cNKLA trading volumes are very high despite limited float at present, so we believe the stock movement is largely driven by short-term traders,\u201d wrote Coster.He notes institutional investors have been more focused on the company\u2019s warrants, predicting \u201dthe stock will remain volatile until the SPAC shares are registered and the warrant calls are exercised (by the company), which could lead to some additional selling,\u201d followed by some degree of stabilization.Get the advanced data and expert fundamental analysis you can trust with Yahoo Finance Premium.
