The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for Massachusetts. Cornell, Dartmouth and Princeton have also announced that they are supporting Harvard and MIT\u2019s lawsuit.\u201cThe effect\u2014and perhaps even the goal\u2014is to create as much chaos for universities and international students as possible,\u201d the lawsuit stated.New federal guidelines presented a difficult choice to universities across America: Either they reopen their schools and do not teach entirely remotely, or have their international students be deported.The new rule by the administration blindsided universities, already reeling financially and logistically from the COVID-19 pandemic that has yet to end.A person wears a mask while walking though MIT's campus in Cambridge, MA on March 10, 2020.

Even though the coronavirus pandemic has shuttered schools, if a student is taking an entirely online course, they cannot remain in the U.S., unless they transfer to a school with in-person instruction \u201cto remain in lawful status.\u201dIf they fail to do so, \u201cthey may face immigration consequences including, but not limited to, the initiation of removal proceedings,\u201d ICE said.But if the school is offering a hybrid model \u2014 both in-person and online education \u2014 they\u2019ll be allowed to take more than one class online, but the school needs to certify their status to the government.Only 8% of colleges have thus far planned for a completely online fall semester \u2014 and 2.1% are \u201cwaiting to decide,\u201d according to data compiled by the Chronicle of Higher Education.Story continuesA student wearing a mask walks through the Yard at Harvard University, on March 10, 2020.

Bacow said. \u201cWe believe that the ICE order is bad public policy, and we believe that it is illegal.\u201dMassachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey also announced her intent to sue over the guidelines on Tuesday night. (A request for an update on Wednesday has not been responded to.)Harvard and MIT stated in the lawsuit: \u201cICE\u2019s action proceeded without any indication of having considered the health of students, faculty, university staff, or communities; the reliance of both students and universities on ICE\u2019s statements that the preexisting exemptions would be \u2018in effect for the duration of the emergency\u2019 posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, which continues to this day; or the absence of other options for universities to provide their curricula to many of their international students.\u201dThe schools also alluded to the fact that the federal government was forcing schools to reopen, even though they were worried about the public health and safety risk given the pandemic was still ongoing.\u201cBy all appearances, ICE\u2019s decision reflects an effort by the federal government to force universities to reopen in-person classes, which would require housing students in densely packed residential halls, notwithstanding the universities\u2019 judgment that it is neither safe nor educationally advisable to do so, and to force such a reopening when neither the students nor the universities have sufficient time to react to or address the additional risks to the health and safety of their communities,\u201d the lawsuit stated.ICE told Yahoo Finance that it\u2019s \u201cunable to provide further comment due to pending litigation.\u201dKen Cuccinelli, acting deputy secretary of DHS, defended the new rules as giving schools more \u201cflexibility\u201d on CNN on Tuesday.Acting Deputy DHS Secretary Ken Cuccinelli defends forcing international students to leave US if classes go online: \u201cThis is now setting the rules for one semester, which we'll finalize later this month that will, again, encourage schools to reopen\u201d https://t.co/fiSJbj2xuO pic.twitter.com/tj5I7Fldts\u2014 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) July 7, 2020\u2018They do not want us\u2019Meanwhile, students waiting to start their college experience in American universities wait in limbo as visa processing delays push back their leave date.One international student waiting for her visa in the UK said she had about a week to secure the visa to study in the U.S. Unless exemptions were made, she would not be able to come to the U.S. on an F1.\u201cI know others are offering flights back to the country or making the visa more flexible,\u201d said the student, who wanted to remain anonymous. \u201cThe U.S. government is making it clear that they do not want us.\u201d\u2014Aarthi Swaminathan is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering education.
