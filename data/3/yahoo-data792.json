For example, Amazon has been a strong performer, gaining 45% since mid-March 2020 vs roughly flat for the S&P 500,\u201d the Barclays note said. \u201cBut just because two things happen at the same time doesn\u2019t mean one causes the other.\u201dFurthermore, they wrote, low-performing stocks have also seen big bumps.\u201cCOTY has been the worst performing name in the S&P 500 since mid-March 2020. But the number of Robinhood accounts that hold COTY has increased sixfold, a much bigger gain than that for Amazon,\u201d the note said.Story continuesUKRAINE - 2020/05/02: In this photo illustration a Robinhood logo seen displayed on a smartphone.

The \u201cbond king\u201d brought up a chart from Robintrack data and pointed to the rise of accounts and activity to the coronavirus lockdown, with a particular acceleration when the stimulus checks hit.To Gundlach, this is an explanation, or at least part of one, to what\u2019s driving the market, especially in the big tech stocks, because money just isn't flowing from institutional investors.Other market watchers, like analysts at Goldman Sachs, have highlighted surges in new accounts, noting the \"continued surge in retail investor trading activity has helped boost the growth stocks most popular with hedge funds.\"Deutsche Bank\u2019s Parag Thatte, who also looked at Robintrack data, mused that there seems to be a lot of evidence that retail investors are getting in on this rally and, like, Gundlach, saw flows markedly different for retail investors than other groups. In particular, Thistle noted that Robinhood accounts holding mega cap stocks (at least $200 billion market cap) rose by 50% during the lockdown.Robinhood is not VanguardThe focus on Robinhood activity makes some sense given the company\u2019s role as a disruptor. It established free trades \u2014 making others do the same \u2014 and is pretty, modern, and millennial- and mobile-friendly. But does it deserve the constant callouts in analyst notes?Maybe, since its data is available via Robintrack, which might be useful to someone. And anecdotally, its 3 million accounts added so far this year (as of May 4) and its adoption of fractional shares mean that a lot of people may end up using the app.But is Robinhood activity enough to move the market? Judging from the popularity of the ability to buy less than a share at a time \u2014 the volumes just might not be that big. Although Robinhood\u2019s assets under management is not public, it likely is miniscule compared to the big players of retail money: BlackRock, Vanguard, Fidelity, and Schwab.However, what if Robinhood\u2019s popularity is a proxy for something else?Nicholas Colas, a former hedge fund manager who writes the DataTrek newsletter, said Google Trends will tell you what the retail market is thinking. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly a thing,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf you use Google Trends, look at search volumes for \u2018buy stocks\u2019 over the last year. Huge interest pickup.\u201dOne likely scenario is the internalized message of \u201cbuy low, sell high,\u201d something that my colleague Myles Udland has also wondered. That, combined with everybody knowing the Buffett aphorism about when to be greedy might have affected some people\u2019s behavior.It sure worked for 401(k) shops like Fidelity, Vanguard, and T. Rowe Price, who told their investors to \u201cstay the course\u201d: Most of them followed the advice.Just like how people didn\u2019t panic and sell their 401(k)s holdings, perhaps they saw stocks with prices that seemed really low and decided to jump in.Colas also pointed out that while it\u2019s hard to know the effects of fractional share ownership \u2014 you can own less than a share on SoFi, Robinhood, Schwab, and others \u2014 it might have an outsized effect, especially given people aren\u2019t always shy about using margin on these platforms.This, he added, \u201cprobably\u201d has contributed to the market run-up.\u201cThe system isn\u2019t really tuned to accommodate lots of small orders,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMarket making algos only know the recent past, so seeing higher order volumes and fewer limit orders suddenly appear may have had an impact.\u201dRobinhood users have increasingly become interested in struggling stocks that are even going bankrupt, like J.C. Penney and Hertz, wading past day-trading into outright speculation given the volatility of these companies\u2019 prices.In addition to trading with bankrupt companies, a Sundial Capital Research note that examined Robinhood user behavior found a 13.1% rise in accounts with short ETF positions versus a 1.2% drop in accounts that had their long counterpart and a 13.1% rise in short ETFs, the largest net difference in two years.\u201cMaybe Robinhood will stick around and this can develop into a reliable indicator of retail sentiment,\u201d wrote Sundial Capital\u2019s CEO Jason Goepfert. \u201cMore likely, volatility will pick up, users will move on to their regular jobs and sports betting, and interest in the platform will wane.\u201d--Ethan Wolff-Mann is a writer at Yahoo Finance focusing on consumer issues, personal finance, retail, airlines, and more.
