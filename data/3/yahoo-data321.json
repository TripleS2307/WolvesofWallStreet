The candidate has some work to do. While the former Vice President leads in national polls, according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll 43% of registered voters said they thought Trump would be a better steward of the economy than Biden, against 38% who said Biden would be better. And a late-May Washington Post-ABC News survey said those polled trusted Trump and Biden in nearly equal measure to oversee the economic recovery. At the very least, Biden does not appear to have an advantage when it comes to economics.None of this is lost on Biden\u2019s advisers. Presiding over a recovery would likely be by necessity the centerpiece of his presidency. A source tells me that his campaign will have a more refined economic plan in the coming days and that making Biden\u2019s case versus Trump\u2019s when it comes to the economy and jobs is a case they aim to make clear.Here\u2019s what Penny Pritzker, former U.S. Commerce Secretary and adviser to the Biden campaign told me yeasterday, which might serve as a fundamental talking point: \u201cJoe Biden will be a good president for jobs and good for the middle class. He will build on inclusive growth. For the next couple of years we need to rebuild jobs, we need to help businesses reopen. Joe Biden will bring us greater certainty, clarity, and stability to our economy.\u201d\"The Vice President believes we need bold investment in job creation, substantial investment in workers and working families to ease their burdens and raise their wages, and we need to hold corporations accountable\u2014having now bailed them out twice in 12 years\u2014to be more responsive to their workers and their communities,\u201d says Jake Sullivan, a senior policy adviser with the Biden campaign who works extensively on economic policy. \u201cHe sees this as a bold agenda that meets the moment when you've got both an immediate crisis that needs to be continually responded to and you\u2019ve got deep structural challenges in the economy laid bare by COVID-19 and with ambitious action can be remedied. That\u2019s how he\u2019s thinking about his agenda next year.\"Story continues(Note two \u2018bolds\u2019 and one \u2018ambitious.\u2019)And in a recent speech at Delaware State University, Biden said that he aimed to \u201cnot just to build back the economy the way it was before COVID-19, but to build it back better.\u201dDemocratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden speaks Wednesday, June 17, 2020, in Darby, Pa. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum)And of course the GOP punched back: \u201cSadly, Democrat leaders in blue states have kept the economy from reopening for all Americans, preventing everyone from sharing in the economic rebirth as the people most heavily impacted by COVID are not yet seeing improvement. Incredibly, Joe Biden is counting on more economic pain for Americans so he can capitalize on it politically,\u201d said Brad Parscale, Trump 2020 campaign manager, in a statement.(Hey, it\u2019s an election year, right?)To really dig in here, let\u2019s look at Biden and the economy from three vantage points. First, what is Biden\u2019s personal experience when it comes to business? Second, what is his track record as a politician and what is he proposing now? And third, what will the economy look like next January, and what challenges and opportunities will he be confronting, which would inform him of what he might actually implement?First, unlike Donald Trump or Bush the elder and the younger, Joe Biden has never really been a businessman. The closest Biden got to the private sector was in the 1960s out of Syracuse University law school when he worked as a trial lawyer and public defender in Delaware. And according to Washingtonian Magazine, Biden \u201csupplemented his income by managing properties, including a neighborhood swimming pool.\u201d Not exactly the Trump Organization. On the other hand, there\u2019s no record of bankruptcies.It\u2019s also worth noting that Biden\u2019s father\u2019s family had some money sloshing around. Biden\u2019s father, Joe Biden Sr., initially was successful in business, but later had his ups and downs, which Biden frequently references in speeches. Biden Sr. worked as a salesman and manager at the American Oil Company\u2014a predecessor of Amoco\u2014in Delaware and Pennsylvania, but later had trouble finding work and sold used cars to stabilize the family P&L. But the elder Biden changed his career again after his son was elected U.S. senator from Delaware. Biden\u2019s sister Valerie Owens told the New York Times: \u201cAfter 1972, he gave up car sales and went into real estate,\u201dOwens said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want a United States senator to have a used-car salesman for a dad.\u201dBottom line: Biden grew up decidedly middle class, but his father\u2019s mixed success has impacted this thinking.Next let\u2019s consider Biden\u2019s record when it comes to business and the economy and markets.As a U.S. Senator from Delaware, Biden has certainly been pro-business, which is not surprising as so many big U.S. companies incorporate there because of the business-friendly legal environment. And Biden hasn\u2019t exactly gone to war with that status quo. He also championed the local banking industry, in particular, MBNA for which he earned the headline: The Senator from MBNA. (To be fair, I suppose advocating for one\u2019s constituents is part of what an elected official does.)None of this is lost on Republicans. \u201cWe've got Joe Biden, who basically lived out of a post office box in Delaware where multinational corporations send jobs freely offshore, many of them to China,\u201d Assistant to the President, Director of Trade and Manufacturing Policy Peter Navarro told me.Which isn\u2019t to say Biden has unilaterally kowtowed to big business. Biden has supported environmental legislation\u2014often counter to the interests of big business\u2014ditto for the Affordable Care Act and light rail.Biden is also widely perceived as pro-union\u2014he has a 85% lifetime approval rating from the AFL-CIO\u2014and has garnered strong support from organized labor. He frequently cites his hard-scrabble(ish) upbringing in Scranton as giving him union(ish) cred. In fact Biden does have an impressive roster of union endorsements including the AFL-CIO\u2014with 12.5 million members, the nation\u2019s largest\u2014the Teachers union and the Steelworkers. Still it should be noted that Trump has some support amongst the rank and file. And there are those on the left wing of the Democratic party who say that Biden hasn\u2019t really ever gone out on a limb for unions. Bottom line: Biden is pro-labor all right, but he\u2019s no Eugene V. Debs.And what is Joe Biden proposing? Well, if you go to his campaign\u2019s website under Joe\u2019s Vision, you find 37 tiles of Biden\u2019s plans for society and the economy including one for small business\u2014which entails tweaking and expanding the existing PPP\u2014and others for health care and employment insurance, bankruptcy reform and essential workers, (along with other positions including those on Muslim-Americans, immigration, two on Black Americans, women and opioid addiction.) Perhaps his most extensive is a massive infrastructure plan that would cost $1.3 trillion over 10 years to rebuild or build our highways, airports, rail and broadband.You could make the case that the stock market is sanguine about Biden\u2019s platform and a potential victory or at least it doesn\u2019t seem to be too worried, given that the chances of him winning have been rising\u2014now 53% versus Trump at 41%, according to predictive market website Smarkets\u2014along with the S&P 500 index as of late. Perhaps that comes as a surprise given Biden said he would roll back a portion of Trump\u2019s corporate tax break, upping the rate to 28%, from 21% which would reverse half of the cut, from 35%, that was enacted by President Donald Trump in late 2017. (Truthfully though, the market\u2019s probably been going up for a number of reasons.)JPMorgan posited that the best case for the markets would be if Biden wins and the Republicans hold on to the Senate. In that scenario, there would be an end to capriciousness and worrisome policy particularly when it comes to China and the rest of the world that some say currently emanates from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, while the Senate would hold the Democrats more liberal leanings in check.Who\u2019s counsel has Joe Biden been seeking? According to a recent New York Times article that's hard to say, as the candidate has sought input from dozens of left-leaning economists, but asks that they not disclose that they have been advising the candidate. Biden is reportedly interested in addressing the wealth and income gap. He\u2019s also sought to include thinking from the younger and lefter half of the party\u2014i.e. AOC, Bernie and Warren\u2014not just the Larry Summers, Gene Sperling, Austan Goolsbee warhorses.\u2018It\u2019s going to take a bold agenda to pull us through\u2019But Biden\u2019s loftier goals might be rendered moot come January 20, 2021, his potential inauguration day, if the U.S. is a total mess. Not that this would be unfamiliar ground. Biden would be taking office under the same lousy economic conditions he did as Barack Obama\u2019s vice president 12 years ago, when the unemployment rate was 7.6% and 11.6 million Americans were without jobs. (Contrast that with 13.3% and 20 million today.) \u201cDuring the Great Recession, [Joe Biden] led the $800 billion stimulus effort by the Obama administration. So he's been a leader during an economic recovery before,\u201d notes Pritzker.\u201cGiven that we will still likely be in a crisis, Joe Biden may find he will be doing more of what he has to do, versus what he wants to do,\u201d says Glenn Hutchins, CEO of North Island and a long-standing Democratic thought leader. First Hutchins notes, as Barack Obama had to continue rescue operations commenced by George W. Bush during the 2008 Great Recession such as TARP and the auto bailout, Biden will likely have to continue some of the current administration\u2019s policies such as stimulus packages, PPP and the like.Then, Hutchins notes, a whole new medical infrastructure will have to be built out\u2014especially if President Trump doesn\u2019t see fit to do so\u2014in terms of contact tracing, PPE and equipment, protocols, therapeutic drugs and especially vaccines to finish off COVID-19 and to prepare for the next pandemic. Done right, this could help stimulate all sorts of new businesses. This medical build-out could be done initially in conjunction with reopening the economy, for which Biden recently released a plan that includes, \u201cfederally funded testing for every worker called back on the job, guaranteed paid sick leave for workers affected by COVID-19 and a federally coordinated contact tracing workforce,\u201d according to NPR.It\u2019s also likely that some states and municipalities will be in pretty bad shape and in need of more funding from the federal government. Some of this could take the form of that medical spend, as well as badly needed infrastructure which is typically done at the state level. \u201cThe Democrats very, very strongly think they\u2019ve got to give money to states, otherwise you\u2019ll see another mass wave of unemployment as the states with balanced budget requirements have to start raising taxes and firing people,\u201d says the aforementioned Goolsbee, former Council of Economic Advisors Chairman under Barack Obama speaking yesterday on Yahoo Finance\u2019s YFi PM.\u201cThe challenge we\u2019re up against is significant, and it\u2019s going to take a bold agenda to pull us through over the course of who-knows-how-many years. [Biden has] indicated he\u2019s prepared to do that,\u201d says Stephanie Kelton, a professor of economics at Stony Brook University and member of the joint task force on the economy created by former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.Still if Joe Biden is elected he\u2019ll have to be extremely judicious when it comes to government spending because our current national debt of $17.7 trillion is 82% of GDP, the highest it's been since 1948, according to the nonpartisan Peter G. Peterson Foundation. \u201cThe Vice President doesn't believe this is a moment for austerity but does believe the president has to be a steward of the long term fiscal health of the country. He has to pay attention to debt over the long term,\u201d says Sullivan. \u201cBut he believes a bigger threat to the country\u2019s fiscal health would be elevated unemployment for years on end.\"Biden may be thinking beyond that. \u201cThe Vice President believes that getting back to the economy that preceded the current crisis would be woefully insufficient,\u201d says Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and former chief economist and economic adviser to Vice President Joseph Biden in the Obama Administration, who\u2019s been advising candidate Biden. \u201cThere needs to be a much more robust policy infrastructure in place that insulates working families against the kind of shocks that come fast and furiously these days, whether they\u2019re pandemics or 100-year floods that happen every year or the ravages of inequality or racial violence, or a health care system that is unresponsive to needs.\u201dSays Sullivan: \"Young people need to be the focus, particularly making sure they\u2019re attached to the labor force and get a start in their careers quickly. They bore the brunt of the last recession and he\u2019s bound and determined they don\u2019t bear the brunt of this one.\u201d\u201cFrankly Biden is being handed a gift here\u2014by the people in the streets, by this moment, to be the kind of president he\u2019s describing,\u201d says Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA and co-chair of the Biden/Sanders task force.If Joe Biden does win in November, it\u2019s not clear that he would see the environment as gift-like. On the other hand, if Biden takes office when the economy is on low, maybe he gets out when it's on high. Better than the opposite, right? President Trump is looking to avoid that.This article was featured in a Saturday edition of the Morning Brief on June 20, 2020.
