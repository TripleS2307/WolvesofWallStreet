Top officials, a presidential tweet, and Tuesday\u2019s press conference have all focused on getting more Americans to wear masks.We are United in our effort to defeat the Invisible China Virus, and many people say that it is Patriotic to wear a face mask when you can\u2019t socially distance. There is nobody more Patriotic than me, your favorite President! pic.twitter.com/iQOd1whktN\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 20, 2020\u201cI'm not opposed to mandates at the state and local level,\u201d said Trump\u2019s Surgeon General, Jerome Adams, adding that local controls \u201cwork best\u201d in stopping the spread especially if they are paired with education. The remarks came during an interview with Anjalee Khemlani for Yahoo Finance\u2019s All Markets Summit Extra on Tuesday evening.Adams also made a full-throated push to mask up in order to help with the economic reopening. \u201cI want people to know masks actually don't inhibit your freedom,\u201d he said, telling Americans, \u201cyou'll have more choices if you wear a face covering.\u201dThe administration has been consistently opposed to a national mask mandate \u2013 something Adams reiterated during his Yahoo Finance conversation. But his openness to local mandates suggests the Trump administration might not seek to block the mandates that states \u2013 from California to Maine \u2013 and businesses have been implementing.White House officials from the president on down have opted to focus on voluntary compliance. Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany urged Americans to \u201cfollow the president's lead\u201d and Trump added that everyone should wear one, saying \u201cwhether you like the mask or not, they have an impact.\u201dStory continuesPresident Trump holds a mask during press conference at the White House on July 21. (JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images)When he was asked about mandates, Trump said, \u201cI leave it up to the governors.\u201d An unpublished report by the White House Coronavirus Task Force from last week reportedly suggested that at least 18 states have enacted stricter measures such as mask requirements.Others, like Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp have taken a different approach. Kemp filed an emergency motion to block the city of Atlanta from enforcing a mask mandate. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who herself has tested positive for COVID-19, announced the mandate in early July.\u2018We can reopen and then we can stay open\u2019The wild card is how Trump talks about specific mask mandates when he is likely to be asked about them in coming days. The White House has long sought to shift responsibility for the crisis to the states but the president has also reinstated briefings on coronavirus that are sure to keep him center stage.In April, while he was briefing daily, it wasn\u2019t uncommon for Trump to talk about being a \u201cbackup\u201d to the states one day and saying he has \u201cabsolute power\u201d over them the next.In recent days, Trump has continued to offer thoughts that clash with his top health experts, like Dr. Adams who has taken on a more prominent role in the administration\u2019s coronavirus response in recent days.During a recent Fox News interview, the president said he didn\u2019t support a national mask mandate because \u201cI want people to have a certain freedom.\u201d He added, \u201cI don\u2019t agree with the statement that if everybody wears a mask, everything disappears.\u201d\u201cIf we can get 90% of people to wear face coverings and get people to practice at least six feet of social distancing from their neighbors and practice good hand hygiene,\u201d Adams said just a few days later, \u201cwe can reopen and then we can stay open.\u201dSome feel face coverings infringe on their freedom of choice- but if more wear them, we\u2019ll have MORE freedom to go out. Face coverings \u27a1\ufe0f less asymptomatic viral spread \u27a1\ufe0f more places open, and sooner! Exercise and promote your freedom by choosing to wear a face covering! pic.twitter.com/3A4fW2qmN8\u2014 Jerome Adams (@JeromeAdamsMD) June 14, 2020Adams also acknowledged that the guidance has shifted on masks and \u201cCOVID-19 has really humbled us in terms of its asymptomatic spread.\u201dDuring his Tuesday press conference, Trump appeared without a mask but pulled one out of his pocket at one point. \"I'm getting used to the mask,\" he said.Adams, who continues his work on the coronavirus task force but did not appear at the president\u2019s press conference Tuesday along with other health experts, said his focus is on giving the president the best information he could.Of the task force\u2019s recommendations Adams said, \u201cthat input is being given to the president of the United States and that's all that I can ask for.\u201dBen Werschkul is a producer for Yahoo Finance in Washington, DC.Read more:Surgeon General Adams: Feds 'working 24/7' on coronavirus, but DC can't do everythingAll Markets Summit Extra: Anthony Scaramucci, Jerome Adams, top CEOs offer clarity amid crisisCarnival CEO: 'We are doing what we need to do' to start cruisingRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit."}]}
