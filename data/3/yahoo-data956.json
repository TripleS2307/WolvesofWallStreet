SAP restated its 2020 outlook for a rise of between 1% and 6% in operating profit.STANDING ALONEQualtrics, whose Experience Management platform gathers real-time feedback from customers to help analyse how a company's products or services are performing, achieved a 32% increase in revenue in the quarter.Yet it remains the smallest of SAP's four business segments, reporting a profit of just 7 million euros in the period.Klein, calling the spinoff a \"win-win situation\", said it would give Qualtrics the opportunity to achieve its potential with a higher degree of autonomy.Story continuesSAP would keep control over and consolidate Qualtrics, which it still sees as a key part of its \"Intelligent Enterprise\" proposition that spans everything from finance to personnel, logistics and customer relationship management.Under the proposed initial public offering, Smith would become the largest individual shareholder in Qualtrics. He and his family had previously owned 80% of the business.SAP Chief Financial Officer Luka Mucic said details of the offering were still to be worked out, but noted it was typical for stock market offerings of tech companies to comprise a stake of 10%-15%.The goal, he added, would be to capitalise Qualtrics properly while giving SAP more latitude to invest in developing its own business or make smaller \"tuck-in\" acquisitions.(Reporting by Douglas Busvine; editing by Keith Weir and Jason Neely)"}]}
