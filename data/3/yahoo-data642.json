SubscribeWalmart is the latest national chain to mandate mask-wearing.On Wednesday, Walmart (WMT) became the latest \u2014 and largest \u2014 national chain to mandate customers wear masks inside its stores. The requirement begins at Walmart stores nationwide on July 20.In a blog post on Wednesday, Walmart noted that just 65% of its stores are located in areas where some sort of mask mandate is in place.And with 90% of the U.S. population living within 10 miles of a Walmart, the company\u2019s announcement amounts to the most significant mask mandate put in place nationally during the COVID-19 pandemic.As my colleague Zack Guzman noted Wednesday, Walmart now joins a list that includes Starbucks (SBUX), Costco (COST), Best Buy (BBY), and Apple (AAPL) in requiring customers wear masks inside stores regardless of what local regulations allow.And so in the absence of a national, federally-driven program to mandate mask wearing in public places, Corporate America has taken up a leadership role.\u201cWhile we\u2019re certainly not the first business to require face coverings, we know this is a simple step everyone can take for their safety and the safety of others in our facilities,\u201d Walmart said in its post.\u201cAccording to the CDC, face coverings help decrease the spread of COVID-19, and because the virus can be spread by people who don\u2019t have symptoms and don\u2019t know they are infected, it\u2019s critically important for everyone to wear a face covering in public and social distance.\u201dLast month, a research note from economists at Goldman Sachs was widely circulated after the firm argued that a national mask mandate could act as a substitute for future lockdowns that would otherwise take 5% off GDP growth. The firm acknowledged that it is difficult to precisely estimate the positive impact of mask wearing on economic growth but that, \u201cour analysis suggests that the economic benefit from a face mask mandate and increased face mask usage could be sizable.\u201dStory continues\u201cWe know some people have differing opinions on this topic,\u201d Walmart said in its post on Wednesday. \u201cWe also recognize the role we can play to help protect the health and well-being of the communities we serve by following the evolving guidance of health officials like the CDC.\u201dAnd as AMC Theatres found out last month, catering to the anti-mask slice of your customer base is a move that will alienate far more shoppers (or in AMC\u2019s case, moviegoers) than requiring masks be worn at stores or theaters. And in response to pushback from customers, the company quickly instituted a policy requiring moviegoers to wear masks in theaters, which are now set to re-open at the end of the month.So while wearing a mask might still be viewed as an inconvenience or a political statement by some, masks are also a part of public life in America in 2020. Gallup polling earlier this month showed that 86% of U.S. adults said they\u2019ve worn a mask in public.And with growing evidence that mask wearing does indeed help curb the spread of the virus \u2014 and as lawmakers take steps to re-institute restrictions in several states \u2014 corporate leaders have taken it upon themselves to institute a de facto national policy on mask wearing four months into the pandemic.Because ultimately, someone had to do it.By Myles Udland, reporter and co-anchor of The Final Round.
