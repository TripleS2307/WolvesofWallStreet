Armed with COVID-19 stimulus checks and two index fingers tapping away on an Apple iPhone (or firmly planted on the steering wheel in a drive to the local Target store), U.S. shoppers showed the discount retailer some major love in the second quarter.Here\u2019s how Target performed compared to Wall Street expectations.Net Sales: $23 billion vs. estimates for $19.82 billionComparable Sales: up 24.3% vs. estimates for a 5.8% increaseQuick Sales Highlights: store comp sales up 10.9%; online sales up 195%; number of customer transactions up 4.6%; average transaction amount up 18.8%.Gross Margin: 30.9% vs. estimates for 28.98%Diluted EPS: $3.38 vs. estimates for $1.58 a shareSales and earnings embarrassed the financial modelers on Wall Street. Sales in electronics exploded 70% as people gobbled up tech gear to support their new work-from-home life during the pandemic. Apparel sales rebounded from a 20% first quarter decline to up double-digits in the second quarter. Sales in Target\u2019s food and beverage category rose at a 20% clip.In all, Target noted it just uncorked its best same-store sales increase ever reported. The company said it gained $5 billion in market share through the first six months of the year. Guess sales from bankrupt department stores and closed malls are going right into the registers at Target.And to top it off, Target\u2019s business hasn\u2019t fallen off the map in August. Recall, Walmart warned on Tuesday sales weakened noticeably at the end of July \u2014 and remain mixed in the early back-to-school shopping period \u2014 as stimulus checks ran out.\u201cDespite the volatility in early August, August sales comps have been running in the low double digits, which shows we are sustaining relevance and the trust we built quarter-after quarter,\u201d Target Chairman and CEO Brian Cornell told reporters on a media call. The only blemish: Similar to Walmart, Cornell acknowledged back-to-school shopping started \u201cslower than usual\u201d in large part as the pandemic wreaks havoc on school openings.Story continuesTech company-like growthTarget\u2019s second quarter earnings report is impressive. The country is locked in a nasty recession, is battling a pandemic and has one eye towards a potentially chaotic presidential election. Oh, and the unemployment rate is still over 10%, some jobs may never come back from the pandemic and retail by and large is in the toilet (putting pressure on even the healthiest of retailers).Yet, Target posted tech company-like growth numbers on the top and bottom lines. Its results are indicative of a company doing a ton right in the minds of shoppers in this topsy-turvy environment. These numbers should be a signal to investors that it\u2019s perhaps time Target\u2019s stock begins to outperform the broader market again.Target\u2019s stock has lagged the S&P 500 for most of 2020, only recently beginning to outperform. Still, Target\u2019s stock is only up a mere 6.3% on the year \u2014 in a world of disconnects, this appears to be another one.\u201cWe will not,\u201d Cornell told Yahoo Finance when asked if Target will buy back its stock this quarter. The company has $4.5 billion remaining under a prior authorization. \u201cWe suspended all share repurchases.\u201dThat may change if Target\u2019s August sales momentum continues into September.Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
