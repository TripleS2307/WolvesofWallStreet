According to a report from eHealth, individuals with federal subsidies through the ACA pay an average of $80 per month, which is approximately $720 a year. For those who are unsubsidized, the average monthly premium for individuals was $456 \u2014 or $4,572 per year.\u201cIt\u2019s not unreasonable to call it a flaw or a limitation in the original design,\u201d Dr. Gerald Kominski, a professor at UCLA\u2019s Fielding School of Public Health, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cThe intention was to try and help people who were most likely to be uninsured and also who had the most difficulty affording insurance in the marketplace.\u201dU.S. President Barack Obama speaks on the Affordable Care Act with Vice President Joe Biden in the Rose Garden of the White House April 1, 2014 in Washington, DC.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)In 2019, the federal poverty level was $12,490. If an individual made more than $49,960 a year, they wouldn\u2019t qualify for an ACA subsidy. For a family of four, the threshold would be an annual income of $103,000 (since the poverty level for a four-person household is $25,750).\u201cAs soon as you cross the threshold,\u201d Kominski said, \u201csuddenly the subsidies go away completely and a small change in your income can dramatically increase the amount you have to pay for health insurance if you\u2019re buying in the marketplace. That is something that really should be corrected.\u201dStory continues(Source: ACA Index Report on Unsubsidized Consumers in the 2020 Open Enrollment Period).The eHealth report found that individuals and families who don\u2019t meet the subsidy threshold \u201care often required to pay four to five times more for comparable coverage.\u201d A family of four can pay between $17,000-$25,000 a year for unsubsidized health care coverage, depending on whether or not they received medical care subject to the deductible.\u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is that people are just right on the cusp for paying four to five times more, comparable to their neighbors who are just under that amount,\u201d Nathan Teater, the manager of IFP sales at eHealth, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cThe average subsidy is $500 for those who qualify. We\u2019re really finding that it\u2019s the middle-class folks that get the burden there, that if we expanded it just a little bit, it would encompass them and help with their costs.\u201d\u2018The ACA was an important step but it doesn\u2019t give everybody access\u2019The candidates in the upcoming U.S. presidential election have very different approaches to Obamacare.U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to the media during a Cabinet meeting at the White House December 20, 2017 in Washington, DC.

Health insurance is deemed \u201cunaffordable\u201d by the ACA if the annual premiums for the lowest-priced plan costs more than 8.05% of your modified adjusted gross income in 2018.Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden speaks to families who have benefited from the Affordable Care Act during an event on June 25, 2020 in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. (Photo by Joshua Roberts/Getty Images)In the meantime, some states have pursued routes of extending subsidies on their own. California, for example, extended subsidies up to 600% of poverty, which would be an income of up to approximately $150,000 for a family of four.\u201cThis report calls attention to it but again for those of us who work in this field and are trying to move the country further to get to universal access \u2014 because the ACA was an important step but it doesn\u2019t give everybody access to health insurance \u2014 we\u2019re well aware this is a limitation and more is necessary to get truly everybody in the country insured,\u201d Kominski said.Adriana is a reporter and editor covering politics and health care policy for Yahoo Finance.
