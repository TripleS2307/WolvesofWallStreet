Last month, pharmaceutical companies Moderna (MRNA) and Pfizer (PFE) announced that each had begun phase three trials on candidates developed through the use of synthetic genetic material, while other vaccines in late-stage trials use a common cold virus modified with a gene from SARS-CoV-2.Next month, Johnson & Johnson will begin the largest late-stage coronavirus vaccine trial yet, involving 60,000 people in the U.S. and other countries, the company confirmed on Thursday.The first vaccine may be ready by the end of the year, but will not become widely available until 2021, Barouch said, echoing a similar prediction made last month by top U.S. infectious disease official Dr. Anthony Fauci.But an initial success will not end the worldwide effort currently underway to develop vaccines, since each version will have strengths and weaknesses, Barouch said.Story continues\u201cIt's very possible that there might be multiple vaccines that prove safe and effective, at least that would be my hope,\u201d Barouch says. \u201cThe more vaccines that become available, the better.\u201d\u201cBecause each vaccine might have some pros and cons: Some might be more effective, some might have different side effects. profiles might be particularly good in the elderly or the young populations, some might have different costs associated with them,\u201d he said.Barouch spoke to Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer in an episode of \u201cInfluencers with Andy Serwer,\u201d a weekly interview series with leaders in business, politics, and entertainment.The U.S. government and Johnson & Johnson have invested a combined $1 billion in a vaccine candidate co-developed by Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where Barouch runs the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research. The vaccine is currently undergoing phase one and two trials but aims to begin phase three trials next month, Barouch said.Harvard University vaccine researcher Dr. Dan Barouch appears on \"Influencers with Andy Serwer.\"The Trump administration has provided financial backing for vaccines through Operation Warp Speed, which has set a goal of 300 million doses by the end of 2021. Multiple vaccines are in development in China and Australia, while England and Germany have produced vaccines currently undergoing human trials.\u201cThe worldwide vaccine effort does span the current cutting edge technologies in multiple arenas. So in that sense, I think that we will see which ones are the safest are the most effective, or the most durable and ultimately are the most deployable for this pandemic,\u201d he adds.Read more:Economy may undergo \u2018sawtooth\u2019 recovery from coronavirus: Former Fed Vice ChairBill Gates: We should be able to \u2018manufacture a lot of vaccines\u2019 next yearJump into stock market expecting rise 'a fool's errand': Billionaire investor David RubensteinMichael Dell: \u2018Not enough\u2019 progress on diversity in the tech industryRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"}]}
