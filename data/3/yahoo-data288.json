Meanwhile, former Vice President Joe Biden has consolidated political support while steadily becoming favored to win in November.Political observers are devoting more scrutiny to what a Biden wave could mean for the Senate, and the economy. A handful of hotly-contested seats could hand the Democrats \u2014 who already control the House \u2014 complete control of Washington.Trump\u2019s declining support among Republicans will make the GOP\u2019s task to hold onto the Senate even tougher. Against that backdrop, the president delivered an Independence Day speech at Mount Rushmore perceived as a rallying cry to a disaffected base that\u2019s being courted by those hoping to see a GOP rout in November.Issues like tax cuts, deregulation and conservative-leaning judges no longer resonate the way they once did with the GOP base given the current turmoil, according to Reed Galen, co-founder of the Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump GOP advocacy group.\u201cThere are a lot of conservatives, for whom, whether it was tax cuts or conservative judges that [formed] the bulwark of why they still defended the president,\u201d Galen told Yahoo Finance last week.\u201cWhat I think you see now is, in the context of COVID-19 and tens of millions of people out of work, the tax cut argument doesn't really work that much anymore, and folks are trying to figure out how they\u2019re going to make their next month\u2019s rent,\u201d he added, also taking aim at vulnerable Republican senators.Last week, Eurasia Group upped the chances of a Biden victory in November to 60%, mirroring a dramatic shift in predictive markets that once overwhelmingly favored a Trump reelection. The firm also pegged at 55% chances that the Senate swings to the Democrats, up five points from its prior estimate.Story continuesJune was an unequivocally \u201cbad month\u201d for the president, noted Jon Lieber, Eurasia\u2019s Managing Director \u2014 one that\u2019s also shaping up to get even worse on Election Day.He estimates that a Biden victory of 4-5 percentage points nationally could result in a GOP loss of at least four vulnerable Senate seats in Arizona, Colorado, Maine and North Carolina \u2014 and perhaps even more.The current state of key Senate races ahead of November's election.While not a base-case for Eurasia, Lieber warned that a unified Democratic majority \u201cwould mean a major policy discontinuity is possible in January 2021. With this, a major shift in market sentiment over the next several months is possible.\u201dEarlier this year, Wall Street fretted as Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders appeared all but certain win the Democratic nomination, but stumbled as Biden surged. The Democratic Socialist\u2019s failure put a progressive, iconoclastic agenda seemingly out of reach.Yet Lieber cautioned that control of all three levers of power in Washington would let Democrats pursue \u201can aggressive agenda limited primarily to fiscal issues and new regulations \u2014 unless they eliminate the filibuster, which is more likely if they control a larger majority of 53 or more seats,\u201d he added.The meaning of a 51st stateThe concatenation of a Trump loss and a Biden blowout that changes the Senate could lead to an outcome that until very recently has been considered unthinkable: Statehood for Washington, DC, and the addition of 2 more Senate seats that would more than likely be Democratic.In a historic first, the House of Representatives voted along party lines last month to make the nation\u2019s capital a state. D.C. statehood has been a Democratic holy grail for years, and something Republicans have resisted.Eurasia thinks that if Democrats run the Senate, it could result in the elimination of a filibuster that would pave the way for two new Democratic Senators, \u201cwhich would structurally and permanently swing the balance of power in Congress toward the Democratic coalition.\u201dVice President Mike Pence laughs as U.S. President Donald Trump holds a baseball bat as they attend a Made in America product showcase event at the White House in Washington, U.S., July 17, 2017. REUTERS/Carlos BarriaIt would also mean a virtually unobstructed, progressive economic policy from a potential Biden administration that would have carte blanche in Congress, the firm noted. That is seen including higher taxes, an expansion of government-backed health care, pro-labor and green infrastructure initiatives.\u201cA larger Democratic majority could bring about structural changes that favor them,\u201d Lieber wrote.\u2018A mission to excise Trumpism\u2019Lieber believes that Trump \u201ccan still turn this around if there is a strong economic rebound this summer, if the contest shifts from being a referendum on his leadership and instead focuses on Biden\u2019s advanced age or policy agenda, or if there were to be growing backlash to ongoing street protests, statues being torn down, or the defund the police movement.\u201dHowever, Lincoln Project\u2019s Galen thinks otherwise. Speaking to Yahoo Finance, he made clear that his group has a broader objective in mind.\u201cThis is not just a mission to take out Trump, but to extent possible to excise Trumpism from both the Republican party and the American political system,\u201d he said, blasting senators for tying themselves so closely to the president.Galen charged GOP senators have \u201cabdicated their ...responsibilities as a co-equal branch of government\u201d \u2014 but now find themselves trapped between the rock of an unpopular incumbent and the hard place of unfavorable political trends.\u201cThey thought back in January that running with the president during a good economy was going to take them over the line. And now that they\u2019ve attached themselves to him, they have very little to run on, and if they separate themselves from him too egregiously he will attack them, and drive their numbers down further,\u201d Galen said.\u201cI think come November, each of the members is likely to get what they deserve,\u201d he added.-Find live stock market quotes and the latest business and finance newsFor tutorials and information on investing and trading stocks, check out CashayFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and reddit."}]}
