The Labor Department\u2019s weekly unemployment claims report showed that 1.1 million workers filed for benefits last week, well above consensus economists expectations of another 920,000. Analysts have been hopeful that claims could one again dip below the 1 million mark for a second time since the start of the pandemic, yet the numbers are still well above the pre-pandemic record of 665,000 new claims from March 2009.The data couldn\u2019t have come at a more inopportune moment, as Washington has yet to agree on a new stimulus package, and the coveted $600 per week unemployment bonus has expired.\u201cNet, net, new jobless filings are rising again which means the economy isn't out of the woods yet with many businesses across the country still in full or partial shut down and unable to pay all their employees or make the mortgage rent and keep the lights on,\u201d Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist for MUFG Union Bank, said in an email. \u201cThe stock market rally on confidence the worst of the recession is behind us may be premature.\u201dMarket participants also reacted to the cautious tone struck in the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s July meeting minutes, as well as officials\u2019 apparent unreadiness to clearly signal their guidance on the path forward for interest rates at their next meeting. In the minutes released Wednesday afternoon, policymakers also appeared to shirk the prospects of adopting formal yield curve targets in the near-term. Treasury yields fell Thursday morning.On the US economy, US central bankers agreed that \u201cthe ongoing public health crisis would weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and was posing considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term.\u201dStory continuesPaul Ashworth, Capital Economics chief US economist, said in a note that \u201cdespite evident concerns that the resurgence in infections could weigh on the economy, the majority of officials were content to wait for more incoming information.\u201dHowever, \u201cwith the infection rate falling again, there may be less urgency to add to the monetary policy stimulus. But the other thing that stands out from the minutes is that Fed officials still believe \u2018strong fiscal policy support\u2019 is \u2018necessary to encourage expeditious improvements in labor market condition. With Congress failing to extend the fiscal stimulus, more of the burden will fall to monetary policy,\u201d he added.\u20144:03 p.m. ET: Stocks shake off jobless claims spike, Nasdaq closes at a record as tech ralliesHere were the main moves in markets as of 4:03 p.m. ET:S&P 500 (^GSPC): +10.68 (+0.32%) to 3,385.53Dow (^DJI): +46.98 (+0.17%) to 27,739.86Nasdaq (^IXIC): +118.49 (+1.06%) to 11,264.95Crude (CL=F): -$0.31 (-0.72%) to $42.62 a barrelGold (GC=F): -$9.90 (-0.50%) to $1,960.40 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): -3.1 bps to yield 0.6440%\u20143:10 p.m. ET: Uber, Lyft win temporary reprieve on order reclassifying drivers as employeesA California state appeals court granted ride-hailing companies Uber and Lyft an extension from having to quickly convert their drivers in the state to employees, allowing them to keep their current business model intact for the time being.

The announcement came after a California judge last week ordered Uber and Lyft to reclassify their drivers as employees, after the state sued the ride-hailing companies in May.\u201cThis is not something we wanted to do, as we know millions of Californians depend on Lyft for daily, essential trips,\u201d Lyft said in its decision to halt California operations. \u201cFor multiple years, we\u2019ve been advocating for a path to offer benefits to drivers who use the Lyft platform \u2014 including a minimum earnings guarantee and a healthcare subsidy \u2014 while maintaining the flexibility and control that independent contractors enjoy.
