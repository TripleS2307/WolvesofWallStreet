Currently, Smarkets estimates Biden has a 56% chance to win the presidency \u2014 a commanding lead but down seven points since the end of last month.\u201cAny anticipated post-convention bounce for Biden has failed to materialize in our market, with his lead sliding to 13 percentage points, down from an all-time high of 28 points at the start of August,\u201d said Smarkets Political Analyst Patrick Flynn.\"We do not know whether this is due to the content of the event itself or the fact this scaled-down edition took place virtually in the midst of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic,\u201d Flynn added. \u201cEither way, it has provided something of a window of opportunity to Donald Trump, as he accepts his own party nomination at the [RNC] this week.\u201dMeanwhile, the president seems to be regaining lost ground, with his chances rising by eight points over the same period to 43% \u2014 their highest in more than two months.Democratic vice presidential candidate Senator Kamala Harris listens as presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden speaks at a campaign event, their first joint appearance since Biden named Harris as his running mate, at Alexis Dupont High School in Wilmington, Delaware, U.S., August 12, 2020. REUTERS/Carlos BarriaTrump\u2019s rise among Smarkets investors mirrors polling data that show his numbers inching up, albeit from a low base, and raises the possibility of a photo finish in November. The data coincide with an economic recovery that, while having lost momentum, is still continuing to grow since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.To be certain, Biden remains the overwhelming favorite in a head-to-head match up against Trump. Political site 538 has shown the former vice president\u2019s odds have remained consistent near 73%, a level identical to Hillary Clinton\u2019s back in 2016 before Trump\u2019s stunning victory.AGF\u2019s Investments\u2019 Greg Valliere told Yahoo Finance on Monday that a Trump victory was \u201cstill doable, especially if you look at the battleground states\u201d like Pennsylvania, where Biden\u2019s advantage has narrowed.Story continues\u201cTrump for all of his flaws is a really, really aggressive campaigner.\u201d Battling against Clinton four years ago, the president showed \u201ctremendous energy...and he may again, he may catch the wave. But we can\u2019t delude ourselves, Trump is clearly the underdog.\u201dAccording to Smarkets, a close election will likely amplify Trump\u2019s accusations that fraud \u2014 stemming primarily from mail-in votes \u2014 is responsible for his loss. The market\u2019s users estimate there\u2019s a 30% chance that Trump will refuse to concede, something political watchers believe is a growing possibility.Javier David is an editor for Yahoo Finance.
