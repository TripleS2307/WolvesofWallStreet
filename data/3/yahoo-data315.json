Many of these are being attributed to Memorial Day weekend activities, in which many crowds assembled throughout that weekend, potentially exposing themselves.Coronavirus cases are declining in New York but remaining steadfast in the rest of the U.S. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)\u201cIn many parts of the country, there was minimal exposure,\u201d Dr. David Katz, a specialist in preventative medicine and president of Public Health and True Health Initiative, said on Yahoo Finance\u2019s The Ticker. \u201cPeople followed the rules, sheltered in place, socially distanced. And now there\u2019s sort of a haphazard return to the world without a lot of care, without reliable use in some places of masks and personal protective equipment.\u201d\u2018We closed the barn door after the horses were out\u2019When the coronavirus pandemic first hit the U.S., states such as New York, New Jersey, California, Illinois, and Michigan experienced an overwhelming number of cases, and pushed many hospitals to their brink.New York City became the U.S. epicenter of the virus, with more than 385,000 cases and over 30,000 deaths as of June 12. Over the last several weeks, however, cases have been declining and the city, along with other regions of the state, are entering phases of reopening.There are over 2 million coronavirus cases in the U.S. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)\u201cClearly, New York City was hit by a wave, and it washed over New York,\u201d Katz said. \u201cFrankly, I think in New York, we closed the barn door after the horses were out. So there was wide level exposure, particularly in the city with people riding the subway. It may be that most people vulnerable to getting the infection in New York City got it.\u201dSlow responses are now leading to infections elsewhere, according to Dr. Michael Saag, associate dean for global health at University of Alabama at Birmingham.Story continuesVolunteer Elizabeth Castro asks people in line to stand 6ft apart along Greenwich Street in Reading, PA on April 25, 2020.

New Zealand has had zero cases for the last month. It\u2019s a small country, but still. Australia \u2014 nine cases a day. Germany has less cases a day for the entire country than we have in the state of Alabama, with only 4 million people in the population.\u201dAlabama has over 22,000 coronavirus cases so far, with 755 deaths, and is seeing a noticeable spike in new cases over the past week. The state, like many others seeing a rise, reopened its economy much sooner than others.\u201cIf they\u2019re not careful about protecting the vulnerable, those spikes in cases could lead to spikes in mortality, overburdening the medical system,\u201d Katz said. \u201cThat shouldn\u2019t happen. We\u2019ve learned enough to prevent that. But it really depends on state policies.\u201dThere are over 7.5 million coronavirus cases worldwide. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)Not-so-socially distant protestsAdding to the growing list of concerns of a spike of coronavirus cases are the recent protests that have taken place over the last week in response to the killing of George Floyd and police brutality against black Americans.While some protesters have made efforts to wear masks and try to socially distance, many have opted out of wearing one and gathered together in big crowds. That raises the potential of the virus spreading.\u201cEven if peaceful, if you\u2019re in a big crowd, if you\u2019re shouting, if you\u2019re getting worked up, if you\u2019re sweating, if you\u2019re jostling, there\u2019s physical contact,\u201d Katz said. \u201cThere\u2019s a high probability of droplets being transmitted through the air. It\u2019s basically a worst case scenario to avoid super spreader events.\u201d\u201cIf anybody in that crowd is infected with COVID-19 and can transmit, certainly close proximity, passions flaring, droplets flying, really bad scenario,\u201d he continued. \u201cAll we can do, I think under the circumstances, is encourage people who are participating in protests to be as careful as possible about personal protection.\u201dMark Henry Jr. of Black Lives Matter addresses a crowd in an area being called the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ) located on streets that reopened to pedestrian traffic in Seattle, Washington on June 11, 2020.

He is expecting to see a bump by July 1 as a result of the protests.\u201cRemember back to the beginning when we were worried about Manhattan overwhelming its health care system,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m very concerned that a lot of the rural hospitals, smaller cities, are going to become overwhelmed, overrun with cases. And that\u2019s going to hurt health care in general for a lot of the people in the country.\u201dCompton Early College High School graduating student Chelsea Donis adjust her mortar after picking up her diploma in a parking lot during a drive-thru graduating ceremony in Compton, California. REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni\u2018The virus is spreading\u2019The other worry is the timing of new cases popping up: As the fall season approaches, so does the flu season.\u201cThe virus is spreading,\u201d Saag said. \u201cCome August, we\u2019re going back to school. And we\u2019re going back to colleges. And we\u2019re doing everything we can to mitigate. But I\u2019m really worried about going into the fall, that we\u2019re going to see a continuing rise.\u201dSome schools, such as Harvard University, are keeping most classes online in order to prevent an outbreak on campus.\u201cWill it, in fact, come back and infect vulnerable people in the fall?\u201d Katz said. \u201cThat remains to be seen. Nobody really knows. Past pandemics have done that. But we can\u2019t know because this is a different scenario.\u201dAnd if a company is actually able to find, develop, and safely test a coronavirus vaccine, that doesn\u2019t guarantee that everyone will actually get one.Workers are seen waiting for the bus in New York City, US. (Photo by John Lamparski/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\u201cWe have several issues to contend with,\u201d Katz said. \u201cThe first is we have difficulty getting people to make use of vaccines that are time honored, reliable, safe, effective. And this is going to be a new one on a fast track timeline. It\u2019s only going to be effective if it works, if it\u2019s very safe, if it\u2019s mass produced, if it\u2019s universally distributed, and if people accept it. And we\u2019ve got this strong anti-vax sentiment in the country.\u201dHe added that \u201cwe may be banking too much on a vaccine, thinking that it\u2019s a panacea when, in fact, there are many impediments to that being the ultimate public health solution, the public response to a vaccine among them.\u201dAdriana is a reporter and editor covering politics and health care policy for Yahoo Finance.
