The company warned employees that layoffs could ensue if there aren\u2019t enough workers who choose to leave the company by the end of the year.In announcing that approximately 16,000 workers would be furloughed on Oct. 1 if another bailout of the airline industry doesn\u2019t materialize, United Airlines (UAL) listed over a thousand management and administrative jobs that would be included.\u201cWhen you see layoffs in management and corporate jobs, it\u2019s a pure indicator of the economic impact of the recession, rather than just the lockdown, since many of these jobs can be done from home and they aren\u2019t necessarily impacted by the lockdown orders,\u201d said Glassdoor senior economist Daniel Zhao. \u201cIt\u2019s an indicator that there\u2019s a traditional recession happening beneath the surface of this public health crisis.\u201dFord and United declined to state the exact job titles or salary range of employees whose jobs would be cut.In this June 25, 2020, file photo, rows of United Airlines check-in counters at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago are unoccupied amid the coronavirus pandemic.

For instance, project managers at Ford have an average base salary of $112,408 and senior managers at United earn at least $120,390.\u201cWhen you have a particularly acute crisis like this, an unprecedented one like this one, there are no truly recession-proof industries or occupations,\u201d said Zhao. \u201cIn general, higher wage workers tend to be better positioned to weather recessions because their jobs are more stable, they can have more savings built up, and they have more experience and education to draw on, when they\u2019re looking for a new job. But I think this most recent round of layoffs is a reminder that there is no perfect shelter from the storm.\u201dStory continuesAnother 881,000 Americans filed for first-time unemployment insurance benefits last week.Job openings only grew by 2% in August, a decline from the over 6% growth in July, according to Glassdoor.Job postings have dropped off most in occupations directly affected by the coronavirus, like hospitality, tourism and sports, according to jobs site Indeed.com. \u201cBut postings are far below last year\u2019s trend in many higher-wage office sectors, too, like software development and banking and finance,\u201d Indeed wrote recently.\u201cThe timing [of ongoing layoffs] is demonstrative here. The fact that these layoffs are happening now indicate that companies are revising expectations of how quickly we can return to economic normal,\u201d said Zhao. \u201c It\u2019s a sign of...some increasing pessimism about the rate of the recovery.\u201dMore from Sibile:The Trump payroll tax break you won\u2019t see on your paycheck\u2018Ghosting\u2019 is not just for lovers.
