Looking at the first presidential debates from 1960 to 2016, the S&P 500\u2019s total return has declined five-days, 10 days and one-month on average after the initial debate. The worst decline comes in the one-month measurement period to the tune of 2% on average.The title for worst post first presidential debate period for the S&P 500 goes to the Sept. 26, 2008 debate between then senators John McCain and Barack Obama. The S&P 500 \u2014 already under fire from the Great Recession \u2014 dropped 8.8% the next day, according to LPL Financial. One month after that debate, the S&P 500 was some 30% lower.As for the best run for the S&P 500 after the first presidential debate, that award goes to the Oct. 11, 1992 showdown between then sitting president George H. W. Bush and governor Bill Clinton. Stocks rose 1.2% the next day, and went onto climb by 4% over the next month.With Democratic presidential candidate Bill Clinton looking on at left, President George Bush speaks during the first presidential debate in St. Louis, Mo., Oct. 12, 1992.

To many, getting a COVID-19 vaccine is more important to the markets than the election in the near-term.\u201cThe number one risk is absolutely we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen with COVID-19 and there might be a second wave. That\u2019s a force of nature that we just don\u2019t know. The lack of fiscal stimulus, lack of an election outcome those are more manmade if you will \u2014 and risks that we can adjust for in our portfolios,\u201d said Franklin Templeton head of equities Stephen Dover on Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade.Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
