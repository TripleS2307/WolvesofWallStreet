But now, the interest has waned and so has the stock. (Photo by Cindy Ord/Getty Images)One of the weirdest stories in investing in 2020 has fizzled out \u2014 for now at least.Rental car company Hertz (HTZ) declared bankruptcy on May 22. And by June 3 the company\u2019s stock had fallen to a mere 82 cents a share from around $3. Soon after, something truly wild happened.For reasons possibly associated with the closure of sports and betting amid the coronavirus pandemic, extra stimulus money, and perhaps even a \u201cif you can\u2019t beat \u2018em join \u2018em\u201d attitude to Wall Street, a ton of people started using Hertz as a casino.Day traders began to pour into the stock, hoping a good-news bump would let them quickly double their money and cash out.With an absolutely incredible trading volume for the stock \u2014 533 million in trades on one day, versus a typical average of a few million \u2014 the stock\u2019s volatility reached category 5.The company, which let us not forget was bankrupt, decided to capitalize (literally) on its stock movements and use the opportunity to sell $1 billion in new stock because it apparently now had value.Market observers were dumbfounded and uniformly on the side of not participating in whatever this was.\"What you're getting right now is this great disconnect between fundamentals and finance,\" said Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, on CNBC with great consternation. \"Take Hertz. A company in a bankruptcy procedure that saw its share price go up....now they're talking about issuing stocks, warning investors they may be worthless.\"\u201cClearly there\u2019s some speculative fever going on right now,\u201d Kathy Jones, Charles Schwab\u2019s chief fixed income strategist, said on Yahoo Finance.Looking at trading volumes and Robinhood activity, it\u2019s clear that many people jumped in during the madness. Some investors did well \u2014 Twitter and the financial media are littered with stories of people doubling their money.Trading has died down. So has the stock.As the media surrounding the stock reached fever pitch and settled down, so did trading volumes, which trickled for 10 days after peak \u201cHertz mania.\u201d A report from Jeffries suggesting that CarMax and AutoNation might \u201cswoop in\u201d to buy Hertz pushed shares 50% higher. Though in overall terms, it was just $1.25 to $1.95, so probably not enough to cover those who got into the trade after June 4.Story continuesSince then, not much has happened. (A Forbes contributor this week published an article \u201cUpdate on Hertz: Still worthless\u201d).What market experts, the personal finance community, and Hertz itself said would happen is happening. The stock has been steadily tracking at just above a dollar. (Hertz said stock it would issue would be essentially worthless unless an \u201cunanticipated\u201d improvement happened because debtors get paid before shareholders and there probably wouldn\u2019t be anything left.)As the excitement died down, so did the stock\u2019s volatility. Not only was the value gone but also its volatility, which provided its allure as an ersatz roulette wheel. It\u2019s not making regular ups and downs anymore and for the dopamine seekers, it\u2019s useless.As one Twitter user who lost money wrote, \"I came too late to the party.\u201dA sign is posted in the entrance to the Hertz Rent-A-Car desk at San Francisco International Airport on April 30, 2020 in San Francisco, California. According to a report in the Wall Street Journal, Hertz is preparing to file for bankruptcy as the travel industry has come to a standstill due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Lessons? For the people who lose maybe. But maybe not.So what have we learned from all of this? Probably nothing.\u201cThe last time I bought a Company with #Bankruptcy worries was #Sunedison and I lost a massive chunk of money,\u201d wrote one daytrader on Twitter. \u201cMy idiot #Robinhood investing friend bought 10k shares of $HTZ at .80 cents..... He told me Scared Money doesn\u2019t Make money. His portfolio is up 300% this year\u2026\u201dA few days later the same person bought some Hertz: \u201cYolo $HTZ why not. Risking some lunch money over night for a steak dinner.\u201dOne seemingly obvious lesson: don\u2019t invest any more money in wildly volatile bankrupt companies than you might risk at the casino.Everyone involved in Hertz who made money\u2014 except for people who bought when it was worth less than $1.30 a share \u2014 have sold their shares. In other words, they are not holding the hot potato. They have cashed out.A story from the New York Times this week about Robinhood day traders found that Robinhood users often trade the riskiest products, sometimes to devastating losses. For a week in June, Hertz was the number-two most popular stock.Contrasting this to bitcoin, it\u2019s clear that some irrational exuberance retail investor bubbles are not all the same. Though this bears some similarities with the Great Bitcoin Thanksgiving, one key difference is bitcoin was not a bankrupt company that had to pay all creditors before shareholders. Perhaps incredibly, bitcoin had value \u2014 if not only to the true, long-term believers.What also became clear is how wild daily volatility (~20%) can happen to any old stock, but that stock-goes-bananas roller-coaster volatility (~400%) probably takes something special, like what happened to Hertz for a few days before everyone got bored and realized the stock would probably end up where people said it would. Even Thursday, an 8% surge \u2014 huge for a normal company \u2014 felt like nothing.The company that went bankrupt \u2014 which means broke, a.k.a. no money \u2014 ends up being worth essentially nothing. That lesson, however, is probably one that people did not learn.Here\u2019s what someone wrote on June 17, right before the stock took a nose dive:\u201cLooks like im bout to make back the money I thought I lost on $HTZ,\u201d wrote one Twitter user right before the stock began to plummet. \u201cThis is why you hold.\u201dFor those who are still holding, waiting for another bump, it\u2019s going to take some real patience. No one is trading it much anymore just for the fun of it. For the stock to go up, it\u2019ll actually require some good news, not just a market frenzy.--Ethan Wolff-Mann is a writer at Yahoo Finance focusing on consumer issues, personal finance, retail, airlines, and more.
