Disagreement between Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill centers on the size of the package, how much compensation to provide unemployed Americans, aid to state and local governments, and other issues.Data released last month by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that Black and Latino Americans have been almost twice as likely to die from the coronavirus as their White counterparts. Meanwhile, a survey published by Fortune in June found that Black Americans had been twice as likely to lose their job than their White counterparts, and Hispanics were nearly twice as likely.\u201cWe have to recognize the reality that the coronavirus has disproportionately affected minorities for a variety of reasons,\u201d Ferguson says. \u201cThinking through the process of helping to rebuild those communities \u2014 I think is very, very important.\u201dDespite the heightened challenges that face communities of color in the U.S., housing and small business aid from prior rounds of stimulus have struggled to reach people of color. Racial justice groups called on Congress last week to address racial inequality in the next coronavirus relief package.Story continuesNEW YORK, NY - SEPTEMBER 20: TIAA CEO Roger Ferguson Jr. speaks during the 2018 Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit at The Times Center on September 20, 2018 in New York City.
