REUTERS/Kevin LamarqueMassachusetts ruling grants debt relief to 7,200On Friday afternoon, a federal judge ordered the Department of Education (ED) to cancel roughly 7,200 former Corinthian Colleges\u2019 student debt in Massachusetts.\u201cThousands of Massachusetts students cheated by Corinthian have finally had their day in court, and they have won,\u201d Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey stated. \u201cThis landmark victory for students will cancel the federal loans for thousands of defrauded borrowers, mostly Black and Latinx students, targeted by a predatory for-profit school and abandoned by Secretary DeVos and the Trump Administration. For five years, our office and the Project on Predatory Student Lending have fought to win students the relief they deserve and today we have won decisively.\u201dAn Everest College campus in Santa Ana, California.Beyond erasing debt for the defrauded students, who had attended Everest schools operated by now-defunct for-profit giant Corinthian, the decision instructed the ED to make borrower defense to repayment process less opaque.But while the Massachusetts ruling only applies to the 7,200 members of the class action suit (which may face an appeal by ED or the Department of Justice), the remainder of borrower defense applicants are uncertain. Defrauded students previously told Yahoo Finance that their claims continued to be denied.Those applications were deemed to be ineligible for loan forgiveness, even though some of the students had not even obtained a degree and could neither transfer their credits to complete it nor access further federal funding to support a fresh start.Story continuesAbout 200,000 to 300,000 defrauded students have filed an application for debt relief but are still in the queue or have been recently deemed ineligible (and are able to appeal). The Massachusetts ruling provides hope for similar class actions suits.(Graphic: David Foster)Debt relief made harder for future applicantsThe Massachusetts ruling is good news for past student borrowers who allege fraud, while a failure to override a presidential veto on the same day is bad news for future student borrowers.In May, President Donald Trump vetoed a bipartisan resolution passed both by the House and the GOP-controlled Senate that aimed to re-establish a loan forgiveness policy designed in 1995 and bolstered during the Obama administration.On Friday, House Democrats Capitol Hill failed to secure sufficient votes to override the Trump veto on borrower defense. The chamber voted 238-173 on H.J.Res 76, failing to secure a two-thirds majority that was needed to override the presidential veto.\u201cToday the House has one final opportunity to ensure the defrauded students get the relief they deserve by overriding that veto,\u201d Congressman Bobby Scott (D-VA) argued on the floor of the House on Friday morning, prior to the vote. \u201cI urge my colleagues to vote to override the president\u2019s veto.\u201dA campus of now-defunct for-profit college ITT Technical Institute sits closed and empty on Tuesday, September 6, 2016.

The new policy goes into effect on July 1, 2020.\u201cThe DeVos rules will limit relief to only about 3% of defrauded student borrowers, and only 1% of schools guilty of misleading students would have to reimburse taxpayers, leaving hundreds of thousands of students trapped deep in debt with no job and a worthless degree,\u201d the National Consumer Law Center said in a press release.New America\u2019s Wesley Whistle, who was following the vote on Friday, told Yahoo Finance that the new policy does not bode well for defrauded student borrowers or American taxpayers.\u201cDeVos's rule fails to protect students or taxpayers because it lets sham colleges off the hook and shifts the burden to students,\u201d Whistle said. \u201cAnd when those students default on their loans, that costs taxpayers too.\u201dBen Miller at the Center for American Progress agreed with that sentiment.\u201cFrom the start, this administration has sat on its hands while tens of thousands more borrowers lawfully seek relief,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAnd it has denied significant relief to students inarguably ripped off by predatory actors such as Corinthian Colleges through innumerate formulas that do things such as deny full relief to borrowers for not having negative earnings.\u201d\u2014Aarthi is a writer for Yahoo Finance.
