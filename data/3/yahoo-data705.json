E-commerce sales nearly doubled, surging 97% as consumers increasingly turned online to shop during the pandemic. However, the stock traded choppily after gaining in the pre-market session, after company executives said sales growth was normalizing and decelerating during the current quarter, as government stimulus to consumers waned.Home Depot (HD) also delivered better than expected second-quarter results, with comparable sales growth of 23.4% in the three-month period, or more than double the 11.4% growth rate expected. Consumers and professionals alike flocked to the retailer for DIY projects while working from home, and as housing market activity and home-building picked up in late spring. Company executives said on their earnings call Tuesday morning that third-quarter earnings results were holding at second-quarter levels, extinguishing hopes of an extended gain for the home-improvement giant.The S&P 500 in recent days has closed in on, but not quite attained, a fresh record closing high, with the blue-chip index\u2019s advance from its March lows now totaling around 50%. Equity trading over the past week or so has reflected a widening breadth in markets, with cyclicals vying for leadership after a months-long run of outperformance among big tech and \u201cstay-at-home\u201d stocks viewed as more insulated from the negative business impacts of the coronavirus pandemic.Story continues\u201cThe path of least resistance seems to be higher for US equities as of late,\u201d Brian Price, head of investment management for Commonwealth Financial Network, said in an email Tuesday morning. \u201cMarkets are seemingly encouraged by a nationwide improvement in coronavirus data after a spike in various parts of the country last month. Big tech and certain consumer companies like Amazon continue to do well but we\u2019ve also seen an improvement in relative performance of cyclical and value-oriented names as of late.\u201d\u201cThis dynamic should be viewed as healthy for the equity market as wider breadth could be key to determining whether or not stocks will continue their advance,\u201d he added. \u201cThere are plenty of risk factors that investors will continue to monitor, such as a resurgence in coronavirus cases, failure to pass another relief bill, and the upcoming elections. Investors are encouraged that we\u2019re back near all-time highs in the market, but they\u2019ll need to stay vigilant for what lies ahead over the coming months.\u201dHowever, any signs of a full-fledged rotation out of tech names and into other areas of the market have lacked conviction, with the financials and energy sectors once again lagging during Tuesday\u2019s session as investors considered ongoing uncertainty around the pandemic, fiscal stimulus prospects and the presidential elections.\u201cI think the factors around quality \u2013 quality growth, strong balance sheets, positive cash flow, dominance in industries, management team \u2013 those factors have been leadership factors across all 11 sectors, and I think that will continue to define leadership in this environment,\u201d Liz Ann Sonders, Charles Schwab\u2019s Senior Vice President and Chief Investment Strategist, told Yahoo Finance\u2019s The Ticker on Monday.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen these multiple phases, and we had that first phase, that recovery phase from mid-May until the middle of June, when there was that hope that we were seeing a strong recovery. And you saw that leadership shift from just the Covid winners out to the more traditionally cyclical areas, and then more recently we seem to have tried that again,\u201d she added. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some fits and starts of tech profit-taking and a move into industrials, financials. But it\u2019s been fleeting so far, and I think the market is sending \u2013 and rightly so \u2013 a mixed message, an uncertain message about what this next stage in the recovery looks like.\u201d\u20144:02 p.m. ET: S&P 500, Nasdaq set fresh record closing highs as tech shares gain; Amazon advances 4% to a recordHere were the main moves in markets as of 4:02 p.m. ET:S&P 500 (^GSPC): +7.78 (+0.23%) to 3,389.77Dow (^DJI): -67.19 (-0.24%) to 27,777.72Nasdaq (^IXIC): +81.12 (+0.73%) to 11,210.84Crude (CL=F): -$0.28 (-0.65%) to $42.61 a barrelGold (GC=F): +$13.00 (+0.65%) to $2,011.70 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): -1.4 bps to yield 0.6690%\u20143:24 p.m. ET: Stocks mixed as tech shares gains; Amazon tracks toward a record highThe S&P 500 and Nasdaq were positive with less than an hour left in the trading day, as shares of big tech companies gained.
