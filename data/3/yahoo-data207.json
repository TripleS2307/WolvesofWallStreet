As of Sunday, nearly 35 million have been sickened worldwide and over 1 million dead \u2014 the highest toll being in the world\u2019s largest economy.In the intervening months, doctors and scientists have taken on the mantles of heroes, spokespeople, polemicists, and unlikely activists \u2014 with many becoming more vocal in ways they haven\u2019t before, even as many lament the politicization of science.Now that President Donald Trump and numerous people within his orbit have contracted COVID-19, health experts are mulling how the crisis will shape the president\u2019s stance about scientific matters, which are guiding his recovery, and how that may play out on Election Day.\u201cNow, we\u2019re in a situation where, for the first time in any of our lives...public health is on the ballot,\u201d said Dr. Howard Forman, a radiologist, Yale University professor and health policy expert. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible not to see that.\u201dPrior to his shock disclosure on Friday, Trump was notoriously dismissive of policies designed to mitigate the virus\u2019 spread, with politics informing his response to the pandemic. The president\u2019s disposition has been widely criticized for informing the government\u2019s response, which has been characterized by fumbled efforts to test, contact trace, and encourage widespread adoption of masking and social distancing.There are over 34 million cases worldwide. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)The federal government \u201chas failed to lean on scientific leaders to manage the crisis; and it has not provided consistent, coordinated evidence-based messaging for the public,\u201d Dr. Esther Choo and Dr. Aaron Carrol wrote in Lancet medical journal \u2014 underscoring how a normally staid and neutral industry has increasingly taken public officials to task.Story continues\u201cThis response would have been terrible under any circumstance, but...the USA has entered a perfect storm, the threat from which has universal reach,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cFrom a health perspective, the upcoming U.S. election could be the most consequential in our lifetimes.\u201dEven if Trump\u2019s illness does change his position, the practical effects could be too late. Experts say the administration has badly undermined public confidence in the top health agencies, in the process galvanizing health and science experts to push back.Dr. Rob Davidson, a rural Michigan emergency room doctor and director of the Committee to Protect Medicare, said that health professionals have been more engaged in the political process in recent years \u2014 thanks to reforms like the Affordable Care Act.However, the federal response to the coronavirus outbreak crossed a line in the sand for many \u2014 in particular, the increased politicization of mask wearing. A growing number of public health and elected officials have called out mixed messages from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which some have criticized as captive to the whims of the White House.\u201cWe always just assumed that if something like this were ever to come to pass one of the most respected public health entities in the world, the CDC, would be the shining beacon of truth,\u201d said Davidson, a former Democratic Congressional candidate.However, the agency\u2019s credibility \u2014 as well as that of the World Health Organization \u2014 has seen been badly diminished amid the crisis.Science, medicine get politicalThere are over 7.2 million cases in the U.S. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)A recent decision by a few politically vulnerable Republican senators to lend support to a Democrat-led effort to oppose the Trump administration\u2019s challenge of Obamacare symbolized how political health care has become.It\u2019s just one reason why there was a rush of medical professionals running for Congress in the primaries, and why the Scientific American endorsed Democratic nominee Joe Biden, the publication\u2019s first time doing so in its 175-year history.\u201cThis year we are compelled to do so. We do not do this lightly,\u201d the editors wrote.Although similar efforts were seen in the lead-up to Barack Obama\u2019s election in 2008, when insurance reform was a call to action, Yale\u2019s Forman said this time is different.\u201cIt\u2019s less partisan. There are a lot more physicians out there who would identify as Republican who will vote for Biden because they realize that\u2019s the only option,\u201d Forman said. \u201cIt\u2019s an energized group right now.\u201d\u2018Misinformation and disinformation\u2019NEW YORK, UNITED STATES - 2020/10/02: Protesters wearing face masks gather in Times Square as they take part during the demonstration.

It\u2019s also undermined the U.S.\u2019s ability to get a handle on rising infections.\u201cRight now we see deliberate misinformation and disinformation coming from, unfortunately, federal leadership, around science,\u201d said Yahoo medical contributor Dr. Dara Kass.However, Forman credited some of Trump\u2019s actions, such as halting cruise travel, funding vaccine research and backing Congress\u2019 stimulus bills.Even if those initiatives haven\u2019t been perfect, \u201cit\u2019s not like he\u2019s gotten everything wrong. His behavior is probably the biggest challenge,\u201d Forman said \u2014 especially on masking.The polarized environment has encouraged many professionals to pick sides. Doctors for Biden, a grassroots voluntary group of health and medical experts, represents a cross-section of Democratic, Republican and Independent members.The group\u2019s organizers are largely the same as those who participated in Doctors for Obama, which helped push for the ACA.Another grassroots group, Doctors Organized to Communicate Science (DOCS), is focused on providing fact-checking and evidence-based information to battle misinformation through social media. The organization is an offshot of the Committee to Protect Medicare.Dr. Farhan Bhatti, a Michigan doctor who leads DOCS, said that \u201cin order to save lives and do our jobs in the best way we can do them, we need to help protect the health of the public. Doctors have been forced to come out of their comfort zones and do something like this.\u201dThe scientific process itself is based on constantly learning new information to help with decisions, Bhatti said. It\u2019s why recent retractions seen in medical journals for high profile issues, like taking hydroxychloroquine as a treatment, are fairly routine \u2014 but are now being amplified by a highly-charged, polarized environment.A journal retraction \u201cmeans it\u2019s more trustworthy because as more data comes that disproves it, scientists have no ego,\u201d Bhatti said.\u201cBut in politics, people might have a belief and dig deeper..regardless of the fact that facts on the ground change over time,\u201d he added, a point also echoed by Dr. Anthony Fauci, the well-respected director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases.Racial disparitiesThe current moment extends beyond the election cycle. Some physicians are also moving to influence public health debates that impact minorities, which have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 crisis.Social determinants of health, the idea that your home environment, education and income level affect your health, has gained popularity amid the pandemic, as studies have shown minorities are disproportionately affected.It\u2019s why Dr. Michael Williams, a surgeon and professor at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville \u2014 who previously avoided comments in public spaces \u2014 has become far more vocal on platforms like Twitter.\u201cYou can\u2019t solve for redlining with chemotherapy,\u201d Williams said, referring to unfair housing practices that have resulted in minority-majority neighborhoods with unhealthy living conditions. Those factors contribute to greater co-morbidities that put minorities at a higher mortality risk from illnesses.The erosion of minorities\u2019 trust in the health system has spurred the National Medical Association (NMA), which represents Black doctors, to create a task force that will assess COVID-19 vaccine data, and help assuage mistrust about any approved vaccine.Dr. Uch\u00e9 Blackstock, a Yahoo medical contributor, said the move from NMA signals just how serious the issue is, and that Congress should tap the medical community to set better health policy.\u2018Playing the long game\u2019Despite stress, burnout and frustration in having to battle the federal government and a deadly pathogen, doctors are meeting the moment. Dr. Pritesh Gandhi, who ended a tough race for a Congressional seat in Texas, told Yahoo Finance he believes the movement will last beyond the election this year.\u201cWe are playing the long game here. It may not convert into votes in 2020, and that\u2019s OK,\u201d Gandhi said.\u201cWhat the last few years have demonstrated is that it is going to take a cross-section of American people to make gains,\u201d he added, one that will be nonpartisan.\u201cI don\u2019t see a patient has a Republic sore throat or Democratic sore throat,\u201d Gandhi said.Kass said a better cross-section of America is needed in Congress, and \u201cphysicians and other scientists running for office is a trend I hope to continue to see.\u201dMore from Anjalee:Redfield: CDC 'preparing earnestly' for vaccine in November, DecemberIndia's tech giants navigate 'literally spiking' WFH demand, H1-B fears in coronavirus eraHow protests spurred Corporate America into action on race, inequalityRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube."}]}
