While the analysis found nearly 11,000 loans in which the borrowers received multiple loans, the memo says only 65 loans would definitely face additional scrutiny since the Trump administration only plans to individually audit loans over $2 million.In this May 21, 2020 photo, a sign on a business in Tenino, Wash., says they are closed due to the coronavirus and state stay-at-home restrictions.

Warren)In the hearing on Tuesday, Mnuchin said loans for lower amounts could face more scrutiny as well.\u201cWe\u2019ve never said those loans wouldn\u2019t be audited,\u201d said Mnuchin. \u201cMany of the things that the committee found I would expect SBA, when they review those loans, would also find those things.\u201dMore than 600 loans totaling more than $96 million went to companies that have been excluded from doing business with the government and more than 350 loans worth $195 million went to government contractors with \u201csignificant performance and integrity issues,\u201d according to the report.Story continuesThe Democratic majority also said SBA and Treasury approved hundreds of loan applications that were missing or incomplete identifying information on the loan applications, including names and addresses.In Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Republicans defended the program saying the questionable loans make up a very small portion of the total loans issued.\u201cLet\u2019s keep perspective on this,\u201d said Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer (R-MO). \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty good rate \u2014 that\u2019s well beyond what we\u2019d expect for the government to be able to do.\u201dThe Small Business Administration says it issued 5.2 million PPP loans totaling $525 billion. The Trump administration says the program saved 50 million jobs, though economists say the actual number of jobs saved is far lower.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin arrives for a House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis during a hybrid hearing, Tuesday, Sept. 1, 2020, on Capitol Hill in Washington (Nicholas Kamm/Pool via AP)Republicans\u2019 competing reportRepublicans on the subcommittee also issued a competing report on Tuesday, highlighting the Paycheck Protection Program\u2019s successes.\u201cTechnical glitches with SBA\u2019s E-Tran portal, which was receiving an unprecedented volume of loan applications, was resolved within a matter of days. SBA also provided clarifying guidance on certain aspects of the program to provide more information to applicants, lenders, and Congress. Their efforts may have prevented an apocalyptic scenario for American small businesses,\u201d said the Republican report.Mnuchin and some Republican lawmakers have previously acknowledged problems in the program\u2019s rollout, but said issues were to be expected as they tried to rush out emergency relief to save struggling businesses. Mnuchin noted $30 billion was returned to the program by companies that should not have initially received the loans.\u201cTaxpayers should not have to choose between quickly getting aid to those who need it and wasting federal funds, and there are simple steps that could have been taken to improve oversight and reduce fraud,\u201d said Clyburn in his opening statements at the subcommittee hearing.Democrats on the subcommittee are now calling on Treasury and SBA to improve internal controls for loan forgiveness, expand oversight of loans by developing a \u201cmore robust, risk-based\u201d audit plan and cooperate with Congress, inspectors general and other watchdogs.About $130 billion remains in the Paycheck Protection Program, but the SBA and Treasury stopped accepting applications on Aug. 8. While there is strong bipartisan support to restart the program and allow some small businesses to get a second loan, stimulus negotiations have stalled on Capitol Hill and lawmakers have not been able to pass a bill.Jessica Smith is a reporter for Yahoo Finance based in Washington, D.C.
