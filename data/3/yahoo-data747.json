Malinowski told Yahoo Finance he aims to flip the perception that Democrats wouldn\u2019t stand up to China.\u201cI actually would be tougher, and hope that Joe Biden would be tougher,\u201d he said during an appearance Wednesday on Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cOn the Move.\u201dRep. Tom Malinowski, D-N.J., during a hearing in 2019. (Tom William/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)On trade, Malinowski says he agrees with Trump. \u201cWe needed to take on the Chinese on trade,\u201d he said, while also building alliances with European and other Asian nations to make any sanctions or tariffs actually stick.\u2018This is not rocket science\u2019The congressman has outlined his plan on building coalitions in a variety of forums, including a recent Washington Post op-ed.He argues that the Trump administration has alienated allies while also not being focused on forcing China into structural changes.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to be up to the challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not rocket science.\"Rep. Malinowski with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. (Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)\u201cWhat I hear from the Trump administration is just, \u201cPlease buy some of our American wheat and all is forgiven,\u201d says Malinowski.During the primary campaign, Democrats often shied away from offering specifics on what they would do different than Trump on trade with China. Biden often went the furthest. During the September 12 debate, he said, \u201cYou need to organize the world to take on China, to stop the corrupt practices that are underway.\u201dHe added, \u201c[The United States makes] up 25 percent of the world economy. We need another 25 percent to join us.\u201dMalinowski endorsed Biden in January, saying that as a former assistant secretary of state, he is \u201ceager to support a nominee with the experience to restore the place of respect America once occupied on the world stage.\u201dStory continues\u2018We will open our doors to refugees from Hong Kong\u2019Malinowski also discussed what do to about the clashes between protestors in Hong Kong and Chinese authorities.\u201cThe strongest, the toughest thing we can do in support of the protesters in Hong Kong\u201d is to signal that \u201cwe will allow the people of Hong Kong to rebuild their experiment in capitalism and democracy in the United States,\" he said.In recent weeks, authorities in Beijing announced what they are calling \u201cnational security laws\u201d that activists say would curb freedoms and end the traditional \"one country, two systems\" relationship between Hong Kong and mainland China.Representative Malinowski represents a district in Northern New Jersey and recently joined a Black Lives Matter protest in the town of Millburn. (Rich Graessle/Icon Sportswire)\u201cWe will open our doors to refugees from Hong Kong,\u201d he says, arguing that doing so would be the \u201cmost important deterrent that we can put into place against increased Chinese repression there.\u201dThe Trump administration has begun the process of withdrawing special trade benefits for Hong Kong in response to the crisis. But Trump also recently said he was not considering placing sanctions on Chinese President Xi Jinping personally.The China and the 2020 electionThe battle lines for Democrats and Republicans over China have become quite clear in recent weeks with each side seemingly in a contest to accuse the other of being the weaker party on China.Nobody in 50 years has been WEAKER on China than Sleepy Joe Biden. He was asleep at the wheel. He gave them EVERYTHING they wanted, including rip-off Trade Deals. I am getting it all back!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 25, 2020In a recent speech, Biden said that Trump has \u201crepeatedly praised China\u2019s containment response, despite a litany of public appeals, including from me, not to bet American lives and the U.S. economy on the word of the Chinese government.\u201dDuring all the election-year back and forth, Malinowski has tried to make progress on China where he can find it. He recently joined a bipartisan letter to Apple (AAPL), which included signers from Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) to Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) to condemn what they called the company\u2019s censorship \u201cat the behest of the Chinese government.\u201dFor Malinowski, the goal is to change the overall focus. He says the United States needs to show the world \u201cthat we are, in every way, different from the Chinese Communist Party.\u201dBen Werschkul is a producer for Yahoo Finance in Washington, DC.Read more:Senate moves to delist Chinese companies from US stock exchangesWhy Trump is moving closer to punishing China for the coronavirusThe Democrats have no answer to Trump\u2019s reckless trade warRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit."}]}
