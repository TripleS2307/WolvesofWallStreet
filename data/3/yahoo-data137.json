But as the country reopens, they have started to house hunt again, according to a new report by Realtor.com released Thursday morning. And it looks like sellers may be slowly following.But some experts warn that it may be too soon to pop open that bottle of Cristal.\u201cAfter being cooped up in homes, luxury buyers and the rest of the market are looking for more space,\u201d said George Raitu, senior economist at Realtor.com, adding that secondary home markets outside of major metropolitan areas like the Hamptons, right outside of New York City, are generating a lot of interest because of changing preferences. The Hamptons saw listing views increase 72% in May from a year ago.Demand for million-dollar homes in the U.S. returned to pre-coronavirus pandemic levels in May, according to Realtor.com.

The report also shows luxury listing price entry point (defined by Realtor.com as the top 5% of homes listed) reached $2.97 million, up 0.5% from April and up 6.1% from the same time a year ago.Even the high-end market in New York City is seeing some sign of life. Just a month earlier, the coronavirus lockdowns basically ground the city\u2019s luxury housing market to a halt.

One contract was signed in March, when the virus peaked, and the other was signed at the end of May.But some experts aren\u2019t as bullish about the luxury real estate comeback.\u201cThe economy and the real estate market are virus dependent,\u201d said Donna Olshan, president of her namesake brokerage, noting that the latest weekly results from her report provide \u201ca spark of hope.\u201dWhile housing data is pointing in a positive direction, coronavirus cases are spiking in Arizona, Florida, Texas and California, and New York, New Jersey and Connecticut announced restrictions on travelers from the Sun Belt states. Some worry what all of this means for real estate activity.\u201cIn my 40 years as a real estate professional, I have seen many markets but I have never seen a pandemic and there are just too many factors involved to make a prediction short or long term,\u201c Olshan added.Amanda Fung is an editor at Yahoo FinanceRead moreUS home price growth picked up in March despite COVID-19Coronavirus hammers the already battered NYC luxury housing marketEconomist on housing: \u2018You can\u2019t buy what\u2019s not for sale\u2019Follow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit."}]}
