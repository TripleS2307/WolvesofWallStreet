Visible support came largely in protests that drew people whose jobs in health care, transportation and construction do not allow them to work from home during the coronavirus pandemic.\u201cWhat the protesters are saying, that if we want to be concerned \u2014 and we should be \u2014 about police violence and people getting killed by the police ... we have to also be concerned about the people who are dying and being put into lethal situations through economic exploitation all over the country,\u201d said the Rev. William Barber II, co-chairman of the Poor People\u2019s Campaign, one of the organizations that partnered to support the strike.Barber told The Associated Press that Monday\u2019s turnout showed the importance of the issue to the people willing to come out during a pandemic to make their voices heard.\u201cSadly, if they\u2019re not in the streets, the political systems don\u2019t move, because when you just send an email or a tweet, they ignore it,\" he said.The Strike for Black Lives was organized or supported by more than 60 labor unions and social and racial justice organizations, which held a range of events in more than two dozen cities. Support swelled well beyond expectations, organizers said, although a precise participation tally was not available.Where work stoppages were not possible for a full day, participants picketed during a lunch break or dropped to a knee in memory of police brutality victims, including George Floyd, a Black man killed in Minneapolis police custody in late May.Story continuesDozens of janitors, security guards and health care workers observed a moment of silence in Denver to honor Floyd.In San Francisco, 1,500 janitors walked out and marched to City Hall. Fast-food cooks and cashiers in Los Angeles and nursing home workers in St. Paul, Minnesota, also went on strike, organizers said.At one McDonald's in Los Angeles, workers blocked the drive-thru for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, about how long prosecutors say a white police officer held his knee on Floyd's neck as he pleaded for air.Jerome Gage, 28, was among a few dozen Lyft and Uber drivers who joined a car caravan in Los Angeles calling on companies to provide benefits like health insurance and paid sick leave to gig workers.\u201cIt\u2019s basic stuff, and it creates a more profitable economic environment for everyone, not just the companies,\u201d Gage said.Glen Brown, a 48-year-old wheelchair agent at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, said his job does not give him the option of social distancing. Brown and fellow workers called for a $15 minimum wage during an event in St. Paul, and he said workers were \u201cseizing our moment\u201d to seek change.\u201cWe are front-line workers, (and) we are risking our lives, but we\u2019re doing it at a wage that doesn\u2019t even match the risk,\u201d Brown said.In Manhattan, more than 150 union workers rallied outside Trump International Hotel to demand that the Senate and President Donald Trump adopt the HEROES Act, which provides protective equipment, essential pay and extended unemployment benefits to workers who cannot work from home. The House has already passed it.Elsewhere in New York City and in New Jersey and Connecticut, organizers said 6,000 workers at 85 nursing homes picketed, walked off the job or took other actions to highlight how predominantly Black and Hispanic workers and the residents they serve are at risk without proper protective gear during the pandemic.In Massachusetts, about 200 people, including health care workers, janitors and other essential employees, joined Democratic U.S. Senate candidates in front of the Statehouse in Boston.\u201cWe\u2019re just being overworked and underpaid, and it makes you sometimes lose your compassion,\u201d said Toyai Anderson, 44, a nursing aide at Hartford Nursing and Rehab Center in Detroit. \u201cIt makes me second-guess if I am sure this is my calling.\u201dAnderson makes $15.75 an hour after 13 years on the job. Nationally, the typical nursing aide makes $13.38, according to health care worker advocacy group PCI. One in 4 nursing home workers is Black.Hundreds of other workers at six Detroit nursing homes walked off the job, according to the Service Employees International Union. The workers are demanding higher wages and more safety equipment to keep them from catching and spreading the virus, as well as better health care benefits and paid sick leave.Participants nationwide broadly demanded action by corporations and the government to confront racism and inequality that limit mobility and career advancement for many Black and Hispanic workers, who make up a disproportionate number of those earning less than a living wage.The demands include allowing workers to unionize to negotiate better health care, sick leave and child care support.In South Korea, members of a transport workers union passed a resolution in support of the strike, raised their fists and chanted \u201cBlack lives matter\u201d in Korean and \u201cNo justice, no peace\" in English.In Brazil, McDonald\u2019s workers rallied outside the flagship restaurant in Sao Paolo. The two largest Brazilian labor federations, together representing more than 24 million workers, filed a complaint with a national prosecutor describing examples of structural racism at the company.McDonald\u2019s said it stands with Black communities worldwide.\u201cWe believe Black lives matter, and it is our responsibility to continue to listen and learn and push for a more equitable and inclusive society,\u201d the Chicago-based company said in a statement.Justice Favor, 38, an organizer with the Laborers\u2019 International Union Local 79, which represents 10,000 predominately Black and Hispanic construction workers in New York City, said he hopes that the strike motivates more white workers to acknowledge the existence of racism and discrimination in the workplace.\u201cThere was a time when the Irish and Italians were a subjugated people, too,\u201d said Favor, who is Black. \u201cHow would you feel if you weren\u2019t able to fully assimilate into society? Once you have an open mind, you have to call out your coworkers who are doing wrong to others.\u201d___Associated Press reporters around the U.S. contributed to this report.___Morrison is a member of the AP\u2019s race and ethnicity team.
