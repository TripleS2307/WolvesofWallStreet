The Fed stood up the facility on May 26 and has pledged up to $500 billion in loans, but as of August 5 the facility had extended only one loan: $1.2 billion to the state of Illinois.Municipalities wanting to access a loan sell tax-exempt eligible notes (of less than 3-year maturity) to the Fed\u2019s facility, which in turn provides a loan priced at the overnight index swap rate plus a spread based on the issuer\u2019s credit rating. Previously, the pricing ranged from 150 (for a AAA/Aaa-rated issuer) to 590 basis points (for a below investment grade issuer).The change today changes that range to 100 - 540 basis points.The facility prices taxable notes with adjustments, which the Fed also changed today to lower the interest rate paid by borrowers.Brian Cheung is a reporter covering the Fed, economics, and banking for Yahoo Finance.
