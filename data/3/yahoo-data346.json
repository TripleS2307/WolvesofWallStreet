His stance underscored a theme several health experts emphasized: There are several (entirely legal) avenues by which the public can be compelled to take a COVID-19 cure, whether they want to or not.Generally speaking, the federal government\u2019s options to mandate vaccinations are circumscribed, according to Richard Hughes, managing director and vaccines leader at Avalere, a DC-based health care consultancy.\u201cPublic health regulation has been left to the states, so I don\u2019t see the federal government superseding states,\u201d Hughes told Yahoo Finance in a recent interview.With that being said, schools and employers are empowered by law to require students and workers to be vaccinated, Hughes explained. While \u201cstates legally could require everyone to do that...politically it would be very challenging,\u201d he added.Yet there are other ways in which governments can limit the ability of citizens to opt-out for reasons unrelated to health or religion. Many countries already require travelers to be vaccinated for certain diseases in order to cross their borders, and a potential COVID-19 inoculation is more than likely to join that list.\u201cAssuming an effective vaccine, countries, states and localities have broad leverage to promote the vaccine under current law,\u201d Farley Cleghorn, a physician and global health practice head at consultancy Palladium, told Yahoo Finance.Story continues\u201cCountries can legally mandate vaccination to cross borders, as with yellow fever, and schools from kindergarten to universities can legally require vaccination for entry, as in much of the world for the expanded program of immunization and with limited medical exemptions,\u201d he said.Additionally, federal guidance defines COVID-19 as a \u201cdirect threat\u201d to workplaces, meaning employers are permitted to implement anti-coronavirus protocols like temperature checks and testing, according to Cleghorn.\u201cIf a vaccine is developed, employers may be able to require employees to become vaccinated and will have to evaluate accommodations for religious beliefs and/or disabilities,\u201d he added.The power to \u2018promote public health\u2019Cases in the U.S. are down by over 10%. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)With economic recovery expectations yoked inextricably to hopes for a vaccine by 2021, and the imperative to achieve herd immunity, officials have an incentive to get as many people inoculated as possible.Yet that\u2019s easier said than done in a wary electorate where universal mask-wearing remains a polarizing issue, and domestic anti-vaccination sentiment has hit a fever pitch.Vivek Cherian, an internal medicine physician and a member of the American College of Physicians, told Yahoo Finance that \u201cthe best hope to fully reopening the economy and getting back to our pre-pandemic lives in large part comes down to development of a successful vaccine.\u201dHowever, Cherian pointed out that \u201ca large portion of the U.S. population either delay or completely skip vaccinations\u201d \u2014 including seasonal flu shots, which less than half of adults actually get each year, he said.For those reasons, state governments \u201cgenerally have the power to promote public health and require mandatory vaccinations. The bigger issue about either state or federally mandated vaccinations would be how controversial the decision would be viewed as,\u201d Cherian added.In the midst of a furious debate about sending children back to school in the midst of the pandemic, giving students a theoretical COVID-19 shot poses challenges of its own, according to Elaine Le, Healthline Media\u2019s chief medical officer.If a vaccine becomes available, \u201cmost parents would likely be leery of having their children be among the first to receive a vaccine, especially since children are not among the highest risk demographic affected by COVID-19,\u201d Le told Yahoo Finance.\u201cMost parents would likely err on the side of caution and might opt to wait until more is known about the efficacy and safety of the new vaccine. Therefore, it would be difficult for schools to mandate the new vaccine in all school-age children,\u201d she added.\u201cUsually, the decision to require a specific vaccine for school attendance is predicated on calculated benefits that far exceed the risks associated with the vaccine,\u201d Le said.\u201cIn this situation, it will be difficult to argue that the benefits would outweigh risks (for a fast-tracked vaccine), especially given that school-age children (or even college students) are not among the high-risk category,\u201d she argued.The trouble with herd immunityVials of a COVID-19 vaccine candidate, a recombinant adenovirus vaccine named Ad5-nCoV, co-developed by Chinese biopharmaceutical firm CanSino Biologics Inc and a team led by Chinese military infectious disease expert, are pictured in Wuhan, Hubei province, China March 24, 2020. Picture taken March 24, 2020. China Daily via REUTERSAccording to a recent survey taken this month by The Harris Poll, 69% said they were somewhat or very likely to get the vaccine \u2014 below the accepted herd immunity threshold and reflecting a deep undercurrent of skepticism over a development process that normally takes years, but is being compressed into a matter of months.Given the likelihood that an effective inoculation will fall short of 100%, experts say 75% would be ideal in preventing person-to-person spread.However, that assumption is based on the idea that \u201c everyone is either vaccinated or already had the virus and is now immune, according to Cherian.Yet the biggest caveat is if large swaths of the public skip vaccination, imperiling the ability to achieve herd immunity.\u201cI would say the skepticism about COVID-19 and the pandemic, and the belief that it\u2019s a hoax...overlap with people that don\u2019t want to wear masks and those who are vaccine hesitant,\u201d Hughes explained. Those sentiments cut across racial and ethnic lines, and pose a stiff challenge to officials who need to encourage widespread vaccinations.Of those surveyed by Harris\u2019 poll, an overwhelming majority felt that health care and essential workers, seniors, and the immunocompromised should receive priority for vaccination \u2014 groups that Avalere\u2019s Hughes said would be \u201cin the front of the line\u201d when a treatment became available.Some have suggested that Blacks, who have been among the hardest hit by COVID-19, should also receive priority.Yet that effort is complicated by the fact that \u201cwe have a history in this country...where African Americans don\u2019t want to be experimented on,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a balancing act here of considering the ethical questions and more balancing the risks and potential horrors.\u201dAbsent a government mandate for a COVID-19 shot, experts stress that officials need to engage the public on the merits of taking the vaccine, and its safety.It\u2019s part of a broader campaign that Palladium\u2019s Cleghorn called \u201cthe need to have a national conversation about access to and affordability of a coronavirus vaccine, [and] to the need to engage communities at most risk for virus transmission and vulnerability to the impact of COVID-19.\u201dJavier David is an editor for Yahoo Finance.
