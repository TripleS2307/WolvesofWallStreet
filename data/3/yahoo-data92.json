Pat Toomey (R-PA) described the goal of the bill as ensuring that \u201cAmerican's livelihoods are intact when we get through this.\u201dNow, almost three months later, he has become one of the Senate\u2019s leading voices against another round of stimulus, arguing that the focus should be on getting people back to their livelihoods.\u201cI would be very, very reluctant to support any kind of legislation that's going to have the effect \u2013 even if unintended \u2013 of delaying the reopening,\u201d he said Thursday in a interview with Yahoo Finance that covered a range of topics including Toomey\u2019s questioning of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell earlier in the week.Toomey has been skeptical of efforts to re-up certain provisions of the CARES Act such as direct stimulus checks and extending unemployment insurance. \u201cIt's not obvious to me that we need to load the money cannon and fire that off again,\u201d he said.Here\u2019s the case he made during the interview.Not interested in more \u2018demand-side\u2019 stimulusToomey points that an idea in the CARES Act, which he was central in helping to draft, was simply to replace lost income but now, \u201cin some cases, it's well beyond lost income.\u201d\u201cA senior citizen who is a retiree didn't have a reduction in their Social Security check because of the pandemic, and yet, that person still got the $1,200\u201d stimulus check, Toomey notes as one example. Like many of his Republican colleagues, he has reservations about what he sees as doing even more \u201cdemand-side\u201d stimulus like the Economic Impact Payments checks that have been going out since April.Senator Pat Toomey exiting the Senate subway in January.

He won his seat during the 2010 Tea Party wave which was heavily focused on government spending. Before entering the Senate, Toomey was the president of the Club for Growth, which describes itself as a network of \u201cpro-growth, limited government Americans.\u201dStory continuesIn his years in Congress, Toomey has, indeed, raised the issue of the ballooning deficit more than many of his colleagues (though he has also supported budget-inflating measures like the Trump tax cuts in 2017).\u201cLet's remember, there's no free lunch,\u201d he says of another round of stimulus. \u201cAll of this is either borrowed money or created money and, either way, Americans are going to pay a price for this.\u201dMitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, is reportedly working with the White House towards another stimulus bill somewhere in the $1 trillion range. The Democratic-led HEROES act, which passed the House of Representatives in May, came with a $3 trillion price tag.The paper version - featuring President Trump's name - of the Economic Impact Payment checks. Most of money was distributed via direct deposit (U.S. Secret Service)McConnell, like Toomey, has often emphasized the need to wait and assess what worked. He\u2019s also said that his bill won\u2019t look anything like the Democratic effort, and will strip out provisions like extending unemployment benefits \u2013 if he gets his way.\u2018Get on with the re-opening of the economy\u2019Toomey has talked about how, to him \u201cthe most important thing is that we get on with the re-opening of the economy.\u201dHe says of Pennsylvania that \u201cunfortunately, a very substantial portion of our state is still not fully re-opened, despite the fact that we are routinely now having record low numbers of positive coronavirus tests, certainly since March.\u201d Pennsylvania and its neighbors have indeed been seeing their caseloads decrease for many weeks.Currently 46 counties in Pennsylvania have been classified in the least restrictive \u201cgreen\u201d classification by Democratic Governor Tom Wolf. Twenty-one counties are in the \u201cyellow\u201d phase but could go green this week.Toomey wants things moving faster. He says if the economy is allowed to re-open more quickly \u201cwe're going to find employment come back quite strongly,\u201d which then can help \u201cevaluate where we are and see what remains to be done\u201d in Washington.Ben Werschkul is a producer for Yahoo Finance in Washington, DC.Read more:Sen.
