I know that sounds crazy to people looking at the stock,\u201d Gordon Johnson, CEO and founder of GLJ Research, told Yahoo Finance\u2019s the First Trade.Johnson has an $87 price target on the stock by the end of next year. (You read that correctly.)Tesla is \u201ctrading at more than double VW\u2019s (VOW3.DE) market cap, yet VW sold 11 million cars last year. Tesla sold just under 370,000 cars last year, looking to sell roughly 500,000 cars this year,\u201d said Johnson.He notes that without the electric vehicle company\u2019s credit revenue sales, it would\u2019ve lost about $300 million in the second quarter of this year.\u201cThat\u2019s essentially taxpayer incentives that they\u2019re getting for selling credit revenues to other car companies, \u201c said Johnson.\u201cThe problem is all of those car companies are now selling electric cars, and Tesla is guiding their credit revenue sales to be down 50% in the back half of this year.\u201d\u201cTheir core business is loss-making,\u201d he added.Johnson points to domestic sales and U.S. gross margins which \u201cpeaked in the fourth quarter of \u201818,\u201d and notes the China growth story touted by some analysts isn\u2019t that impressive.\u201cThe reality is in the month of July they sold about 11.4 thousand cars in China. They produced about 12.2 [thousand] so they actually built inventory, and that\u2019s despite a price cuts globally this year, four of which were in China,\u201d said Johnson.\u201cWe think reality is much different than what is being pumped out there and we think the stock price is driving analyst opinions which is the buffounding to us, versus reality,\u201d he added.Tesla has made heads spin and sent analysts racing to re-rate over the last several months.Year-to-date the stock is up about 385%. Shares will start trading on a split-adjusted basis on August 31st as announced earlier this month.The stocks valuation in recent weeks has been called \u201cmind-boggling\u201d by one analyst.Story continuesIn July one of Tesla\u2019s biggest bulls saw the stock headed to $2,322.Wedbush\u2019s bull Dan Ives recently raised his price target to $1,900. He told Yahoo Finance Tesla \u201cis a tech company, not an automobile company,\u201d pointing to the upcoming Battery Day next month.But Johnson is sticking to his bearish call, with a just-wait-and-see perspective.\u201cThe real data doesn\u2019t match up. We think once that matches up, you\u2019re going to have selling which we think will drive the stock lower,\u201d he added.Ines covers the U.S. stock market.
