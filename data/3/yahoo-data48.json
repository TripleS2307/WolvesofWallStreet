Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said Aug. 3 that a lack of a relief package would be a \u201cpretty traumatic move\u201d for the economy.\u2018Too little support would lead to a weak recovery\u2019For his part, Powell has walked a tightrope with his language on fiscal policy, urging action while at the same time emphasizing the central bank\u2019s independence.But Powell said Tuesday that policymakers should be more afraid of offering too little support than offering too much support, given the \u201cearly stage\u201d of the economic recovery.\u201cToo little support would lead to a weak recovery, creating unnecessary hardship for households and businesses,\u201d Powell said.The Fed chief\u2019s remarks come as House Democrats and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin continue to negotiate over a second coronavirus relief package.As Senate Republicans worry about the size of the fiscal package, Powell has said that the middle of a pandemic is \u201cnot the time to prioritize considerations\u201d like the debt. Down the line though, Powell has said the U.S. budget deficit will need to be dealt with.Story continuesThe Fed\u2019s next policy-setting meeting is scheduled for Nov. 4 and 5, just after the presidential election.Brian Cheung is a reporter covering the Fed, economics, and banking for Yahoo Finance.
