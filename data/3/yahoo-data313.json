On Monday, AstraZeneca (AZN) said its experimental COVID-19 vaccine was safe and produced an immune response in early-stage clinical trials.According to the U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams, a slowing number of deaths are due to a variety of treatment protocols that include Gilead\u2019s (GILD) remdesivir, the generic drug dexamethasone as well as convalescent plasma therapy; still, there are new reports of increased casualties which are lagging the surging cases.Meanwhile, cases do appear to be leveling off in some hard-hit states like Arizona and Florida and California \u2014 all of which reported slower case rates on Monday that were lower than the prior 7-day average. The Sunshine State, which has seen roughly 10,000 new cases daily, and the Lone Star State are among the biggest concerns, yet Idaho has also emerged as a new worry.On Twitter, Harvard Global Health Institute director Ashish Jha pointed out the state \u2014 along with other rural areas \u2014 has seen a \u201cvery concerning rise\u201d in cases. It bodes poorly for the ability to grapple with hospitalizations as the surge continues, and a fierce debate escalates over the need for a nationwide public masking policy.Vaccines race aheadOnly five states are seeing at least a 10% decline in cases. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)Promising coronavirus vaccine news emerged Monday from Oxford University\u2019s candidate, which is being developed in partnership with AstraZeneca, showing 100% effectiveness in producing an immune response after two shots.Yet it is still an open question about how long the protection against the virus will last.Separately, Moderna (MRNA) and Pfizer/BioNTech (PFE) (BNTX) are part of an exclusive club of pharma giants developing a COVID vaccine. Both other candidates have also cleared early stage trials with positive results and are progressing ahead in clinical trials.Story continuesPfizer has also secured a deal with Britain for 30 million doses of its candidate, if successful. The UK also has a deal in place for the Oxford vaccine, including with AstraZeneca and the Serum Institute of India, which has promised 1 billion doses.July is shaping up to be a decisive month in the race for a cure, as results were due for some trials. Among the afore-mentioned candidates is China\u2019s frontrunner CanSino, whose seults of a Phase 2 trial were also released Monday.Meanwhile in India, the country\u2019s first vaccine candidate has begun the first phase of its clinical trials. Covaxin, produced by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech, will enroll more than 1,100 individuals for its Phase 1 and 2 trials.Impact on other drugsAmid increasing hopes for a COVID-19 cure, new studies are underscoring the virus\u2019 impact on the health sector, particularly drugs. SingleCare, a discount pharmacy program, has tracked prescription trends since the start of the pandemic.CEO Rick Bates told Yahoo Finance Monday that at the start of the outbreak there was a 500% increase of flu vaccines administered, likely in hopes of preventing the coronavirus \u2014 as the two were being compared at the time in mid-March. Yet more people are filling longer prescriptions to avoid having to go out as often.\u201cOur 90-day prescriptions are up about 30% year-over-year, and that growth I think is going to hold as we watch...this resurgence of cases throughout the country,\u201d Bates said.And as mental health needs have skyrocketed amid the lockdowns, anti-depressants have spiked 50% year over year, Bates said.Anjalee Khemlani is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
