(Thomas Piketty is a French economist whose work focuses on wealth inequality.)In an interview with Yahoo Finance, Nomura chief U.S. economist Lewis Alexander pointed out that the pandemic has underscored existing inequalities and \u201cis a much bigger problem than people have acknowledged before.\u201dA pop-up food drive in Pennsylvania.

With health care inextricably tied to employment in the U.S., the massive unemployment crisis amid a public health crisis means that many have lost their income as well their insurance.Right now, Nomura notes, certain classes of workers are suffering far more than others. Those who can work remotely largely have weathered the storm, while those who cannot struggle. Furthermore, many of these workers earn less and are more vulnerable.Big changes in the futureSo far, there have been big governmental measures to manage the crisis. The Fed turned on its money printer, opened lending facilities, and Congress passed the CARES act, extending unemployment benefits, incentivizing employers to keep employees on staff, and sending checks to millions of Americans.Story continuesAll of this worked well, but is temporary.Nomura notes that the pandemic and racial justice protests following the death of George Floyd have pushed politicians further left on healthcare and other social safety net policies.\u201cImportantly, the movement is accompanied by more taxes on the rich and large corporations with growing concerns over fiscal sustainability, which means that the combination of more progressive tax systems and permanent income support for low-income households could also be in the policy agenda to reduce the income disparity,\u201d wrote Nomura\u2019s analysts.In certain cities like Los Angeles and Atlanta, and some countries the idea of universal basic income is catching on. The concept was an integral part of presidential candidate Andrew Yang\u2019s policies and is supported by some in the tech industry, like Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey. Even on the conservative side, some have expressed curiosity about UBI and its potential in supplanting existing safety net measures.The coronavirus has already caused the country to look harder at how it insures people \u2014 often incentivizing them against testing and treatment.
