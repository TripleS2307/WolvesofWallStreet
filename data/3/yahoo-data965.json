U.S. House Judiciary Committee via REUTERSNow Facebook and Microsoft, smelling blood in the water, are hitting back, calling out Apple with statements that echo the kinds of complaints antitrust investigators have heard from other developers who say Apple is hurting competition and consumers. And that could be a problem for Apple in the long run.\u201cThe audience for [last week\u2019s hearings] was not just a domestic audience, it was an international audience, it included competitors, third parties, and competition authorities,\u201d explained former Federal Trade Commission Chairman William Kovacic.\u201cSo [Apple knows] that every time they twitch now, they will have close scrutiny from many different eyes including quite a few astute observers,\u201d added Kovacic, who now serves as a law professor at George Washington University, where he specializes in global competition.Shots across the bowsApple\u2019s current antitrust problems stem directly from its App Store policies and how it enforces them. App developers, Spotify (SPOT) being one of the most prominent, have complained to investigators and regulators about Apple\u2019s app review guidelines, saying they aren\u2019t applied evenly.Developers have also taken issue with the 30% commission Apple collects on app sales through the App store, saying it\u2019s unfair because Apple sells competing apps, like its Apple Music service, and doesn\u2019t have to pay a commission to itself. Apple also operates its own gaming service called Apple Arcade, which is available as a subscription and lets users play games across their iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers.Story continuesInvestigators are looking at whether Apple\u2019s tight control over the App Store, which is the only means developers have to get their apps on the company\u2019s iOS devices, stifles innovation and unfairly targets competing apps.Cook denied such accusations during a recent hearing before the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law, pointing to the fact that the App Store has helped generate 1.9 million jobs and is host to 1.7 million apps, of which Apple only competes with a few dozen.Facebook and Microsoft are well aware of the accusations Apple is facing, and appeared to purposely use language supporting the argument that Apple is operating an illegal monopoly in their surprisingly public responses to Apple\u2019s decision.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies remotely during a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing on antitrust on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, July 29, 2020, in Washington. (Mandel Ngan/Pool via AP)\u201cEven on the main Facebook app and Messenger, we\u2019ve been forced to bury Instant Games for years on iOS,\u201d Vice president of Facebook Gaming Vivek Sharma said in a statement following Apple\u2019s decision to reject the portion of the Facebook Gaming app that allowed gamers to play Instant Games.\u201cThis is shared pain across the games industry, which ultimately hurts players and devs and severely hamstrings innovation on mobile for other types of formats, like cloud gaming. And while it\u2019s disheartening to deliver only part of the Facebook Gaming app experience on iOS, our gaming creators have asked for it for awhile. We thank them for waiting this long.\u201dNone other than Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg even hit out at Apple saying in a statement, \u201cUnfortunately, we had to remove gameplay functionality entirely in order to get Apple\u2019s approval on the standalone Facebook Gaming app \u2013 meaning iOS users have an inferior experience to those using Android.\u201dMicrosoft, meanwhile, issued a statement through a spokesperson specifically saying that Apple treats gaming apps differently than other apps.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson, File)\u201cApple stands alone as the only general purpose platform to deny consumers from cloud gaming and game subscription services like Xbox Game Pass,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cAnd it consistently treats gaming apps differently, applying more lenient rules to non-gaming apps even when they include interactive content.\u201dThose statements were each crafted specifically to hit Apple where it hurts when it comes to the antitrust investigations into the App Store.Apple, for its part, points specifically to two sections of the App Store policy that the Facebook and Microsoft apps violate. Microsoft, the company says, violates Apple\u2019s policies regarding remote desktop clients, while Facebook violates terms for HTML 5 games and bots.Apple\u2019s will need to respondWith Facebook and Microsoft clearly appealing to arguments that Apple is using its market power against competitors, the Cupertino-based company will need to prove its moves are intended to benefit consumers, Kovacic explained.\u201cTo me the crucial question would be how well developed is the justification that [Apple is] going to present for the current policy. How convincing is that story going to be, not just to insiders who watch the sector carefully, but to this larger audience that\u2019s now watching every single move, as well as law enforcement authorities around the world that are now watching this.\u201dAccording to Kovacic, Apple will have to show that its current policies provide a significant benefit to its users. The company may also be able to rely on the fact that the relationship between leading enterprises is changing, and that they are each now competing against each other in similar industries.Apple is all but certain to face additional challenges from competitors as the antitrust investigations into its App Store continue, and it\u2019ll need the right answers if it\u2019s to escape unscathed.Got a tip?
