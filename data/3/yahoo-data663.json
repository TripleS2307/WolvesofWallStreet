There are discussions that certainly the Democrats would like to repeal that legislation and bring the tax rates back up somewhere around 28% to 29%, which would be pre-2017 levels. That would certainly challenge margins and earnings growth in an environment where it\u2019s already challenged.\u201dOf note is that there are 35 seats identified as up for grabs in the Senate in November, according to polling tracker 270toWin. Currently the Senate has 53 Republicans and 47 Democrats. In the House, Ballotpedia estimates 74 of the 435 House races are in play. The Democrats control the House, 233 to 197.But a blue wave must not be ruled out amid dissatisfaction among voters with how Trump has handled the twin crises of the COVID-19 pandemic and racial injustice.Cronk joins a yawning list of Wall Street strategists voicing concerns on a Joe Biden presidential win unleashes that blue wave in the House and Senate.In this June 11, 2020, photo, Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden speaks during a roundtable on economic reopening with community members in Philadelphia.

(AP Photo/Matt Slocum)The former vice president has put forth reversing half of the president\u2019s signature tax cuts, lifting the statutory rate to 28%. Credit Suisse estimates this change in taxes would increase the effective rate by 4% to 5%, and cut $9 off estimated S&P 500 earnings per share. Over at Goldman Sachs, it has projected that Biden\u2019s tax plan would lead it to reduce its 2021 earnings estimate by 12%.Story continuesExperts believe Trump would continue to extend his tax cuts in a second term, which could support corporate profits and stocks.\u201cIt might put downward pressure and take a little bit of momentum out [of the market],\u201d Cronk said of a potential Biden win.Concerning for investors right now is that the market has yet to price in a Biden win or a blue wave. If Biden pulls further ahead in the presidential race polling, market pros expect stocks to react \u2014 perhaps harshly.\u201cThe markets are not pricing in a Trump election, but they aren\u2019t pricing it out either. Right now for whatever reason if you talk to the Irish punters, the markets haven\u2019t yet decided which way the election is going to go. If it becomes clear it\u2019s a Biden Democratic more progressive, higher tax environment, the market is not prepared for that at this moment. It\u2019s not pricing it in or out, but it will,\u201d warned SMH Group CEO George Ball on The First Trade.Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
