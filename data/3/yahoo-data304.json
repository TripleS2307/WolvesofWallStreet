But though Robinhood has taken steps in response, it\u2019s not enough, the academic said.\u201cThey haven\u2019t done anything to deprogram some of the addictive features built into this app, taking a page out of the endless scroll, taking a page out of the random rewards Facebook and Instagram offer,\u201d Galloway said.Galloway said he loves online trading, and that fact that it has made it possible for anyone to get involved \u2014 he himself says he started investing at 13 with $200 from his mom\u2019s boyfriend. But the straight-talking professor is concerned about what Robinhood is doing -- and his worries have prompted him to invest in a competitor called Public.The entrepreneur and professor said he has invested in the app, which is similar to Robinhood but a healthier version, in Galloway\u2019s view.It has a \"financial literacy\" component that prioritizes education, and Galloway plans to do some seminars) as well as a social media platform for investing. Similar to Robinhood, it has commission-free trading and fractional share ownership, making it possible for someone to buy just $5 worth of a stock.Story continues\u201cNo options, no margin trading, 40% female investors who tend to be more long-term,\u201d he said. \u201cI think big tech is a wonderful thing, but I think with online trading we have an opportunity to go in very early and say, \u2018how do we ensure young men do not become addictive and lead to mental health issues?\u201dGalloway may be stumping for Public, but he also railed against trading too much -- something others have accused Robinhood\u2019s users of doing. Generally, Galloway said that trading more leads to worse results.But the young company Galloway is backing may see headwinds as other more long-term-focused investing platforms like Vanguard, Fidelity, and robo advisors Betterment, and Wealthfront also prioritize education, risk management, and the big picture. Many banks even allow customers to buy stocks these days.According to Galloway, Public has a similar feel to Robinhood \u2014 that tech, user friendly feel that gets people comfortable. But Galloway sees it as something that isn\u2019t mutually exclusive with responsibility.\u201cHow do we get the great taste without some of the calories,\u201d the professor mused. \u201cPublic is trying to be the good guy in the [retail trading] space.\u201d\u2014Ethan Wolff-Mann is a writer at Yahoo Finance focusing on consumer issues, personal finance, retail, airlines, and more.
