Gavin Newsom have been forced to put their differences aside to address the wildfires sweeping across the west.The California wildfires have destroyed more than 2 million acres and devastated farmland. At least 24 people have died and about 44,000 people have been evacuated.Trump approved a major disaster declaration for California on Aug. 22 which enabled the state to access federal aid. The president assessed the damage in person during a visit to the state on Monday.When the wildfires ignited in California about three weeks ago, Trump blamed the wildfires on forest mismanagement by local leaders.\u201cYou gotta clean your floors, you gotta clean your forests \u2013 there are many, many years of leaves and broken trees and they\u2019re like, like so flammable, you touch them and it goes up,\u201d Trump said during a rally in Pennsylvania on Aug. 20. \u201cMaybe we\u2019re just going to have to make them pay for it because they don\u2019t listen to us,\u201d he said referring to local leaders.El presidente Donald Trump escucha al gobernador Gavin Newsom informarle sobre los incendios que afectan a California, el lunes 14 de septiembre de 2020 en el aeropuerto McClellan de Sacramento, en McClellan Park, California. (AP Foto/Andrew Harnik)In response, Newsom, a Biden supporter, slammed Trump during his speech at the Democratic convention on Aug. 20. \u201cThe president of the United States threatened the State of California, 40 million Americans that happened to live here in the State of California to defund our efforts on wildfire suppression, because he said we hadn\u2019t raked enough leaves. You can\u2019t make that up,\u201d he said.However, as the wildfires rage on, Newsom has taken on a more conciliatory tone with the president, acknowledging past forest mismanagement.\u201cThere\u2019s no question, when you look past this decade and looking past almost 1,000-plus years, that we have not done justice on our forest management. I don\u2019t think anyone disputes that,\u201d he said on Monday. \u201cThe state of California, your administration just entered into a first-of-its-type commitment, over the next 20 years, to double our vegetation management and forest management.\u201dNewsom did emphasize, however, that \u201cone thing is fundamental: 57% of the land in this state is federal forest land; 3% is California. So we really do need that support. We need that emphasis of engagement.\u201dStory continuesFarmland devastationFarmers in Sonoma County have been hard hit by the wildfires, which have disrupted grape and vegetable harvests.\u201c[The wildfires are] hitting our red grape industry really hard and it\u2019s a tough situation because there\u2019s potential for smoke taint,\u201d Tawny Tesconi, Sonoma County Farm Bureau executive director, told Yahoo Finance.Vineyards not owned by specific wineries face an even tougher dilemma, Tesconi said.Smoke and haze from wildfires hovers over a vineyard Thursday morning, Sept. 10, 2020, in Sonoma, Calif. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg)\u201cYou\u2019ve got the grape grower who grows the grapes and you\u2019ve got the winery who processes the grapes,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the grape grower has what\u2019s called crop insurance. And so they can take a chance and pick their grapes and hope the insurance works, but they have to prove smoke taint; or they pick the grapes and take a chance that the winery is going to reject it.\u201dTesconi warns that food prices may spike as a result of the wildfire food supply chain disruptions.\u201cYou can\u2019t stop milking cows, you just can\u2019t. But [from] a standpoint of all those other parts of the sector, the processing facilities...that may have had interruptions because of evacuations...we\u2019re also dealing with power shut-off programs,\u201d said Tesconi, explaining that in some cases farmers also have to take the extra step of washing off the ash that has fallen on crops, further disrupting the flow of their businesses.\u201cThere is going to be an increase in costs of getting that food to market, so there\u2019s an expected potential increase in food costs to the consumer as well,\u201d she said.Trump has support from farmers Trump has maintained strong re-election support among farmers during his presidency in spite of criticism of his handling of the pandemic. More than 70% of farmers plan to vote for Trump, according to an August survey by agriculture publisher DTN Progressive Farmer. That\u2019s a solid majority, but significantly lower than the 89% of farmers who said they would vote that way in the April survey.As many farmers are forced to evacuate and continue to contend with food supply chain disruptions, many welcome Trump\u2019s aid.\u201cSometimes the president doesn\u2019t necessarily say things correctly about the whole raking the forests, but I hope the underlying comment on that is really about that we need more forest management,\u201d said Tesconi.\u201cSo if there\u2019s going to be some opportunity for the federal government to step in and help us do a diverse kind of platform of forest management, I\u2019m hoping his visit here is just kind of the kickoff for that,\u201d she said.More from Sibile:Trump cuts funding for \u2018white privilege\u2019 training as more Republican voters acknowledge systemic racismWe\u2019ll \u2018have a way\u2019 to ban fracking in Biden administration: Sierra ClubJob cuts come for white-collar workers: \u2018There are no truly recession-proof\u2019 occupationsThe Trump payroll tax break you won\u2019t see on your paycheck\u2018Ghosting\u2019 is not just for lovers.
