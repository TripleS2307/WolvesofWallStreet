Tech giants like Google may not exactly be sharing your information with the world in the same way Apple seems to say they do, but Apple is keen on making it clear that it doesn\u2019t harvest user data to sell advertisements, and instead leans on its own hardware and services.The purpose of the ad is similar to a massive billboard Apple put up near the Las Vegas Convention Center during CES 2019, which showcased an iPhone with bold text stating, \u201cWhat happens on your iPhone, stays on your iPhone,\u201d a play on the \u201cWhat happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas,\u201d tagline.Apple\u2019s iPhone security has been a major flashpoint for its relationship with the Department of Justice in the past. It was the phone\u2019s encryption that saw investigators looking into the 2015 terror attack in San Bernardino to call on Apple to create a backdoor to hack the phone held by one of the shooters.The FBI, however, was eventually able to break into the iPhone, which ended a stalemate between Apple and the DOJ.More recently, the 2019 terror attack on Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida resulted in a similar showdown between the Justice Department and Apple, with the tech giant saying it had turned over all information to the government that it had.Story continuesThe FBI was eventually able to break into the phone without Apple\u2019s help.Apple's massive ad outside of CES 2019.
