Powell said higher education would be required to get higher paying jobs, leaving the bottom wage earners without a way to increase compensation if education and new skills are unattainable.\u201cIf you\u2019re on the right side of those trends then those things are good for you,\u201d Powell said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not, then your wages are going to stagnate.\u201dThe Fed's 2016 Survey of Consumer Finances shows the income stagnation among the lowest earners relative to the highest earners.The Fed\u2019s data from its Survey of Consumer Finances shows that since the financial crisis the richest families have seen faster income growth than the poorest families. In the post-recovery period covering 2009 through 2016, the median family in the bottom 20% of wage earners saw income grow by only 6%. The top 10% saw income grow by 9% over that period of time.Prioritizing low-income workersA 2018 paper from the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Isabel Cair\u00f3 and Jae Sim, however, argues that monetary policy should consider income inequality when designing its policy tools - particularly during times like now when the target federal funds rate is backed up to zero.Pointing to previous economic research, Cair\u00f3 and Sim note that higher-income groups tend to save more than lower-income groups (or in economic terms, have a lower marginal propensity to consume). The authors argue that higher-income earners can \u201coveraccumulate\u201d financial wealth and sustain high savings rates; lower-income earners are more likely to spend larger shares of their income just to make ends meet.Story continuesThis presents a dilemma for the Fed, which broadly wants to discourage saving and spur consumption (or in economic terms, drive aggregate demand) to fuel an economic recovery.The suggestion: an \u201coptimal\u201d monetary policy prioritizing the reduction in unemployment to improve the welfare of lower-income wage earners - even at the expense of welfare losses to higher-income earners holding onto financial assets.\u201c[T]hese findings suggest that monetary policy can have distributional consequences,\u201d the authors write.The paper adds that policymakers should \u201cprovide a sufficient degree of monetary accommodation during economic downturns\u201d to break down the link between high income inequality and insufficient aggregate demand.Running the economy \u2018hot\u2019Vincent Reinhart, a former Fed economist who advised the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, told Yahoo Finance Thursday that the Fed should be mindful of how its monetary policy can asymmetrically affect people along the income spectrum.\u201cThe monetary transmission mechanism goes through markets,\u201d said Reinhart, who is now a chief economist at BNY Mellon Asset Management. \u201cIt is inflating equity prices. And equity prices are the value of something that is held unequally.\u201dPowell has been cautious in describing the Fed\u2019s role in narrowing the income gap, which is not part of the Fed\u2019s Congressionally-mandated goals of price stability and maximum employment.The Cair\u00f3 and Sim paper similarly notes that monetary policy \u201ccannot eliminate income inequality,\u201d adding that fiscal policy may be better suited to address the widening gap.But the Fed\u2019s experience with the post-2008 recovery has enlightened policymakers to the benefit of letting the labor market run \u201chot\u201d through extended periods of accommodative monetary policy, which had the effect of drawing in marginalized, low-income workers into better-paying jobs.Last year, the Fed launched a listening tour as part of a broader effort to review its monetary policy framework. A wrap-up of the 15-event \u201cFed Listens\u201d circuit detailed the many conversations with workers and employers who warned that the central bank\u2019s aggregate view of \u201cmaximum employment\u201d may overlook stagnation among low-income workers.\u201cOne clear takeaway from these events was the importance of sustaining a strong job market, particularly for people from low- and moderate-income communities,\u201d Powell said in the report.Brian Cheung is a reporter covering the Fed, economics, and banking for Yahoo Finance.
