Today, that number has been slashed in half. Kelly said the company invested significantly in Zoom (ZM) software, along with cameras and additional screens 18 months ago, when he hired his first software engineer in Australia. The experience went so smoothly, he immediately turned to additional hires outside of the U.S. when the pandemic hit.\u201cOnce we realized, \u2018Hey we made that work,\u2019 we were able to hire great talent that was not in San Francisco, then it became well why not Montreal, why not Uruguay,\u201d Kelly said, singling out markets where his most recent hires have come from.Cost savings for employersTech companies like Amazon (AMZN) have been hiring remote workers internationally for years, but like so many digital trends, the shift has been accelerated by the pandemic. The move has been especially prevalent among early-stage startups, squeezed by the cost of talent in Silicon Valley, where top software engineers can command salaries topping $150,000.Nisan Gabay, who helps recruit tech workers for companies globally, says firms can hire the same jobs for a near 50% discount in Montreal, where he\u2019s based.Story continues\u201cTo be clear, no one is going to rival the overall amount and depth of talent in Silicon Valley. The question is, how accessible is that talent to you, if you're a startup ... Everybody wants those engineers, and the compensation as a result has gone up and housing is gone up,\u201d said Gabay, a partner at AC780. \u201cIf I'm going to get a B engineer in the Valley versus an A engineer in Montreal, which is better? In many cases, the A engineer in Montreal is better than the B engineer in San Francisco.\u201dWhile the shift to hire internationally has been most pronounced in IT-related jobs, the move isn\u2019t limited to tech startups, according to remote jobs listing site FlexJobs. Career Development Manager Brie Reynolds says the site has seen a 12% to 15% increase in overall listings every month since the pandemic began, with Canada and Mexico topping international listings. The cost savings for employers are significant, with companies saving as much as $22,000 annually for each fully remote worker, Reynolds said.\u201cBefore [the pandemic] in the U.S., about 5% of the total workforce worked remotely full time. During the pandemic, we saw that shift to about 63% of the workforce in the U.S. working from home,\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cThat\u2019s a massive shift over a very short amount of time. For a remote work experiment like this, to have succeeded as well as it has in the worst circumstances, it really says something about remote work potential.\u201dIllustrative picture showing application for United States of America work visa H1B with penImmigration barriers accelerate remote trendThat trend has given rise to companies like Oyster, which helps firms build out their distributed workforce. The startup, founded in December, develops software that streamlines the hiring process, including setting up payroll and ensuring compliance with local labor and tax laws. While the process traditionally amounted to tens of thousands of dollars in lawyer and accountant bills, Oyster charges a monthly fee of $200 per employee, simplifying the hiring procedure for companies unfamiliar with international markets.Co-founder and CEO Tony Jamous says his business has spiked 25% to 30% during the pandemic. And while the ease to work remotely has accelerated the push to hire outside of the U.S., the crackdown on H-1B worker visas have also been a significant factor in the shift. Earlier this year, President Trump blocked U.S. entry of foreign workers on H-1B and H-2B seasonal worker visas, saying the move was aimed at \u201cgetting Americans back to work as quickly as possible.\u201d At the time, administration officials estimated the move would open up 525,000 jobs for U.S. workers.\u201cThe U.S. used to import a lot of great talent from around the world, especially in technology, to come and build the next generation of software companies,\u201d Jamous said. \u201cNow you have increasing immigration barriers that are being put in the U.S., that actually is making it much harder to bring in 100,000 developers from India every year to the U.S., and it's not going to get better.\u201dKelly says cost hasn\u2019t driven his company\u2019s decision to look internationally.He has largely focused Survata\u2019s new hires in countries that share similar time zones to allow for a smoother work experience. He recently hired three software engineers in Uruguay and another in Montreal to build on the \u201ccluster\u201d of employees in their geographic regions. He\u2019s also made a number of operational changes to ensure remote hires feel included in the company\u2019s culture. Survata shifted the company\u2019s \u201cstand-up\u201d meetings from 5 p.m. San Francisco time to Friday mornings to accommodate the time difference. Group meetings are all conducted on individual computers instead of conference rooms, so remote workers don\u2019t feel excluded from the conversation because of their location. Kelly is now re-thinking how to conduct team-building excursions outside of the office, like a painting class, to make sure those outside of the Bay Area can take part, post-COVID-19.\u201cWe still believe in the value of in-person, micro interactions. You can get things answered faster without a meeting and it\u2019s good for social bonding and learning,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cWe just think it\u2019s good for [diversity and inclusion] efforts to be open to hiring people from other parts of the world and other people from different backgrounds who can\u2019t afford San Francisco.\u201dAkiko Fujita is an anchor and reporter for Yahoo Finance.
