The perk is a clear shot across the bow at Amazon (AMZN) \u2014 Walmart\u2019s fiercest retail competitor \u2014 and is being offered at a discount to the tech giant\u2019s wildly popular, $119 per year Prime subscription.It also solidifies Walmart\u2019s own status as an online behemoth in its own right. Throughout the pandemic, Walmart reaped the rewards of being an essential business that remained open. Recently, the company saw a massive spike in its e-commerce business, as consumers stocked up on pantry essentials and other merchandise during lockdowns.Walmart+ members will get access to unlimited free delivery on more than 160,000 items, from groceries and toiletries to toys and electronics, which will be delivered to their doorsteps as soon as the same day. To qualify, orders must be at least $35.The Walmart+ membership also features fuel discounts of up to 5 cents per gallon at Walmart, Murphy USA (MUSA) and Murphy Express gas stations. Members can access the Scan & Go feature in the Walmart App, allowing customers to pay on the spot and avoid the cashier lines.Janey Whiteside, Walmart\u2019s chief customer officer, described the membership program as \u201cthe ultimate life hack\u201d for its customers.\u201cWe\u2019ve talked a lot about how the way customers shop is rapidly evolving today more than ever. We know that customers want more products than they can find in stores and online,\u201d Whiteside said on a call with reporters.\u201cWe know they want services that solve the needs that pop up in daily lives. And we know that our customers are looking to get time back all while keeping more money in their pocket,\u201d she added.The Walmart+ benefits are in addition to the retailer\u2019s existing offerings such as free curbside pickup, NextDay Delivery, and two-day delivery.Story continuesTo be sure, the retailer intends to add more perks to the membership offering in the future. Walmart is also offering a 15-day free trial for the membership.Given Amazon\u2019s growing dominance, the subscription service has been anticipated for some time now.Whiteside, however, downplayed the Amazon effect, saying that it was \u201creally important for us... to make sure that we understood what was most important for our customers. As we went through the pandemic\u2026 what we saw was customers\u2019 needs, and wants were changing, and, in the beginning, almost on a daily basis,\u201d she added.According to the executive, Walmart wanted to understand what mattered to its customers and provide the right benefits that are \u201crobust enough and that scale enough.\u201dShares of Walmart have climbed more than 13% year-to-date. The stock closed down $1.45, or 1.03%, at $138.85 on Monday.Julia La Roche is a Correspondent for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on Twitter.
