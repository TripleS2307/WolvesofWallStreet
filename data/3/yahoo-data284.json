If it\u2019s not addressed soon, according to doctors and experts, there could be what he called a \u201csecond hidden pandemic\u201d to worry about: untreated chronic conditions.\u201cWe know primary care is very important for a very good reason, and the reason is because if you don\u2019t do prevention, you will pay the price in complications and heart attacks and kidney failures and strokes,\u201d Dr. Farzad Mostashari, Aledad CEO and co-founder, said recently during a teleconference call with The Commonwealth Fund. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a dramatic decline in primary care services \u2026 but we should all be very worried about the untreated chronic diseases.\u201dGinger Rae has her blood pressure checked by registered nurse practitioner Rachel Eisenberg during a checkup. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)A recent survey by the Primary Care Collaborative, conducted June 5-8, found that 46% of patients have been in contact with their primary care practice at least once over the last two months.But the same survey found that nearly 65% of clinicians are reporting some level of strain in delivering care to their patients. These strains include lack of PPE (48%), reduction in staff (37%), reductions in patient visits (78%), and rejected telehealth claims (18%). Furthermore, 63% of clinicians say their stress level is an all-time high. These numbers have only slightly improved from a previous survey conducted at the end of March.There are over 2.2 million coronavirus cases in the U.S. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)\u2018So much that we have to dig ourselves out of\u2019When patients can\u2019t see their doctors regularly, things can fall through the cracks.\u201cLord knows so many of them need their chronic care maintenance visits and these children need their immunizations and developmental visits and such,\u201d Dr. Gary LeRoy, an Ohio-based family physician and president of the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), told Yahoo Finance. \u201cThere\u2019s so much that we have to dig ourselves out of as far as our patient visits and the patient services that are needed.\u201dStory continuesThis can exacerbate chronic illnesses, which were already a growing issue in the U.S. before the coronavirus pandemic came along. A 2017 RAND study found that 6 in 10 of the roughly 252 million adults in the U.S. have a chronic illness and 4 in 10 have two or more. The Partnership to Fight Chronic Disease estimates that more than 30 million Americans suffer from three or more chronic illnesses.A paramedic with Anne Arundel County Fire Department takes the blood pressure of a patient as he responds to a medical call on April 9, 2020 in Glen Burnie, Maryland.(Photo by ALEX EDELMAN/AFP via Getty Images)The treatment of chronic illnesses \u201cis a cost to the health system,\u201d David Hoffman, an associate professor of ethics and health policy at Maria College, previously told Yahoo Finance. \u201cAnd as a result, everyone\u2019s health insurance is more expensive. It\u2019s more expensive to operate health care institutions because of the demand.\u201dAccording to the CDC, 90% of the nation\u2019s $3.5 trillion in health care expenditures were for people with chronic or mental conditions.\u201cThe interesting thing is, when patients can\u2019t and/or don\u2019t want to come into the office, and then you\u2019ve got a lot of staff sitting around saying, \u2018What can we do? We\u2019re slow. We\u2019re not seeing patients,\u2019 the pivot for us there is to then proactively outreach to patients,\u201d Dr. Ryan Knopp, a family physician at Stone Creek Family Physicians in Manhattan, Kansas, told Yahoo Finance.Dr. Victor Perez with 60-year-old Sharron 'Kay' Thornton. (Photo by: Kerry Sanders/NBC NewsWire)In other words, Knopp said, \u201ccalling our highest risk and vulnerable patients for COVID and people that had gaps in their health care, engaging our staff to outreach to them to educate about the pandemic, give guidance, help them understand how our office was functioning, answer any questions, address health care needs, sometimes that even turns into a televisit.\u201dDr. Jacqueline Fincher, a Georgia-based physician and president of the American College of Physicians, explained how not being able to check in with your regular doctor can lead to major problems.\u201cOur local surgeon in our small town told me that in those three weeks of March after things had been declared, he saw two ruptured appendixes,\u201d she told Yahoo Finance. \u201cHe hadn\u2019t seen a ruptured appendix in a couple of years, but he had two of them in three to four weeks because people were afraid to go to the emergency room.\u201dParamedics and firefighters with Anne Arundel County Fire Department load a patient onto the ambulance on April 21, 2020 in Glen Burnie, Maryland. (Photo by ALEX EDELMAN/AFP via Getty Images)\u2018Three-fourths of my practice went out the door\u2019When the coronavirus first started making its way throughout the U.S., governors called for a halt to non-emergency urgent visits. And although many of the practices shifted to telehealth, there were still noticeable changes.\u201cThree-fourths of my practice went out the door, or just didn\u2019t come in the door because of that mandate,\u201d LeRoy said. \u201cAny business like restaurant services, if you lose three-fourths of your customers, you can only survive so long with a full staff there and one-fourth of your revenue, your customers, coming in the door. Many of us, because of not wanting to lay off or furlough our staff, marched forward trying to have our staff do things and provide services remotely for our patients without having to lay them off.\u201dMany of LeRoy\u2019s patients found ways to pivot to telemedicine, even though they weren\u2019t initially getting reimbursed for all of it by insurance companies and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).Family doctor Alex Krist listens to Jane Duncan's heartbeat during her office visit in Alexandria, VA. (Photo by Katherine Frey/The Washington Post via Getty Images)\u201cThere was a wide gap between me picking up the phone and calling my patients or our staff calling our patients and providing refills and information to our patients by telephone and realizing that we would not be paid for that,\u201d LeRoy said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing that for years with our patients.\u201dAnd telehealth doesn\u2019t work for everyone: Dr. Jacqueline Fincher said it\u2019s been a \u201chuge issue\u201d for some of her patients.\u201cI\u2019ve been in practice for 32 years now,\u201d Fincher said. \u201cMy practice has grown old with me, so I have a lot of patients who are over 65, have limited understanding or most don\u2019t have a computer. Some of them have a smartphone, but I tell you still, flip phones are still very common around my area. You can\u2019t do telehealth with audio and video if you don\u2019t have a smartphone or computer.\u201dThere over nearly 9 million coronavirus cases worldwide. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)And there is still a need for in-person visits if a patient needs a physical exam, especially if they are experiencing newer problems.\u201cThat helps you make that differential diagnosis of, is this coming from the GI tract or is this really coming from the heart or whatever?\u201d Fincher said.A rollercoaster rideAlthough states are now in different phases of re-opening, the number of coronavirus cases is only declining in some.In Arizona, Texas, and Florida \u2014 three states that re-opened their economies earlier than most \u2014 coronavirus case counts are at the highest levels since April. And if some states are forced to shut down again, that could mean primary care practices take another hit.\u201cWe are going to be on a long rollercoaster ride here \u2014 as a clinic, as health care providers, as a country, as a society,\u201d Knopp said. \u201cNeedless to say, it\u2019s hard to predict what the future of this pandemic is going to be, but I think all of us understand that it\u2019s going to be a rollercoaster ride.\u201dAdriana is a reporter and editor covering politics and health care policy for Yahoo Finance.
