The fiscal policy has been coupled with monetary measures from the Federal Reserve and aggressive moves to help the economy.\u201cMost people, including at the Fed, think that as long as you don\u2019t have high inflation, you can keep juicing up the economy with lots of free money, with lots of liquidity,\u201d he added.\u201cDuring a recession you need stimulus. You need liquidity backstops. But the issue is that you need to withdraw that pretty much once a recovery or a bounce-back begins,\u201d he said.\u201cThat was not what was done in 2010, 2011, 2012, when you had subsequent rounds of quantitative easing, even as the economy had recovered,\u201d said Sharma.Rise of \u2018zombie companies\u2019Sharma says too much intervention has crowded out start-ups and contributed to the rise of \u201czombie companies.\u201d\u201cThese are companies that don\u2019t even make enough profit to pay their interest for 3 years in a row. So those companies keep rising, and it crowds out the new companies from coming up,\u201d he said.\u201cTwenty percent of all U.S. companies today can be classified as zombie companies. In the 1980s it was 2%, so something is going amiss in the system,\u201d he said.REUTERS/Issei Kato TPX IMAGES OF THE DAYSharma also warns too much intervention ends up driving asset prices higher.Story continues\u201cNow you\u2019ve moved to a situation where the tail wags the dog. Every time the market falls by 1% or 2%, because let\u2019s say some stimulus is not being enacted ... immediately there\u2019s panic,\u201d he added.\u201cBy mollycoddling by ensuring that volatility remains so low, we\u2019re doing the opposite, which is in terms of making the beast bigger to the extent that its counter-productive for the code principles of capitalism,\u201d he said.\u201cWhat you ended up getting was massive asset price inflation, where asset prices are so high, and I think that this is where we\u2019re stuck in this trap,\u201d he said.Get the advanced data and expert fundamental analysis you can trust with Yahoo Finance Premium.
