The inscription, however, leaves out the quest for profit, which is currently threatening the \u201cswift\u201d delivery of mail.Americans have come to depend on the modern iteration of the Postal Service to quickly deliver lifesaving medicines, election ballots, bills, checks, and other goods through rough weather, world wars, natural disasters, and pandemics. Nearly 6,190 USPS employees, deemed essential workers, have tested positive for COVID-19, and more than 60 have died. But now, as the cash-strained Postal Service faces what union leadership is calling \u201cChristmas every day for package delivery\u201d and an impending November presidential election that will likely necessitate an unprecedented increase in vote-by-mail ballots, it appears that the 108-year-old credo may have met its match in new Postmaster General Louis DeJoy. \u201cThese changes are happening because there\u2019s a White House agenda to privatize and sell off the public Postal Service,\u201d said Mark Dimondstein, president of the American Postal Workers Union. \u201cBut there\u2019s too much approval for the organization right now. They want to separate the service from the people and then degrade it to the point where people aren\u2019t going to like it anymore.\u201dThe end of overtime work and other changes come as the Postal Service staff finds itself stretched thin. Nearly 40,000 workers have had to quarantine for two weeks after exposure to the virus, according to sources close to the USPS. Data obtained by the American Postal Workers Union, which represents about 200,000 postal workers, shows that nearly 20% of all work by mail handlers, city carriers, and postal drivers is done in overtime. Story continuesThere are no plans to hire more employees to make up for the cut in hours. Because the Postal Service is required by law to pre-fund 75 years\u2019 worth of retiree health benefits for new hires, it is generally thought of as more cost-efficient to increase overtime rather than hire new employees. \u201cOvertime will be eliminated\u2026If the plants run late they will keep the mail for the next day,\u201d reads an internal memo reviewed by Fortune. \u201cIf we cannot deliver all the mail due to call offs or shortage of people and you have no other help, the mail will not go out.\u201dThe memo warns that \u201cthis is the first wave of changes that will be coming to USPS this year,\u201d and that \u201cwe all must have a different mindset to keep the USPS alive.\u201d The memo points to Bethlehem Steel, GM, and Packard Electric (all corporations, not public services) as companies that faltered because they \u201cdid not want to change and be profitable.\u201d Another memo, entitled, \u201cPivoting for Our Future,\u201d warns that \u201cone aspect of these changes that may be difficult for employees is that\u2014temporarily\u2014we may see mail left behind or mail on the workroom floor or docks, which is not typical.\u201d But, the memo explains, \u201cthis is a critical time for us, when decisive, quick, and meaningful action is needed.\u201d The mail left behind would presumably be delivered at a later date, though the document doesn\u2019t clearly state that.Critics of the changes say they don\u2019t see how minimizing mail delivery efforts will lead to an increase in revenue. Empirically, the opposite has occurred. In late 2011, the USPS announced nearly $3 billion in service cuts that slowed first-class mail delivery for the first time in 40 years. It ended the 2012 fiscal year with a record net loss of $15.9 billion, compared to a net loss of $5.1 billion for the same period the year before.\u201cEvery time we\u2019ve slowed down mail, we\u2019ve lost revenue,\u201d said Dimondstein. The new postmaster general, he said, instituted sweeping policy change after just one month in his position and without consulting any unions or representatives with deep institutional knowledge.\u201cThese seem to be arbitrary decisions. If you slow down mail and packages, people are going to go elsewhere to get deliveries,\u201d he said. The Postal Service was losing money at an unsustainable pace before the COVID-19 crisis, but it has seen a precipitous drop in revenue since. For this fiscal year, which ends Oct. 1, the USPS is predicting a revenue loss of $13 billion due to COVID-19. That\u2019s on top of the nearly $9 billion the USPS had been losing annually before the pandemic. In order to keep the Postal Service afloat, advocates are asking Congress for $25 billion in immediate assistance, a $25 billion modernization grant to overhaul infrastructure, and $14 billion in debt forgiveness. The Postal Service Board of Governors, which consists of three Republicans (all appointed by President Donald Trump) and two Democrats, unanimously approved of the ask in April. But Trump has repeatedly said that he refuses to sign any legislation with a USPS bailout provision. \u201cThe Postal Service is a joke,\u201d said the President in May. His administration nixed a bipartisan attempt to provide $13 billion to the Postal Service in March and previously recommended measures to privatize parts of the service. The Trump administration\u2019s efforts have been met with backlash: The USPS is the most well-liked government agency in the country according to Pew, with a 91% favorability rating. Another poll found that 92% of American voters said they supported direct financial aid for USPS as part of the next coronavirus relief bill. Dimonstein took particular umbrage with comparisons to private institutions like Bethlehem Steel.\u201cA private business can make arbitrary business decisions, but we\u2019re not a private business. We\u2019re a service,\u201d he said, adding that even during the best of times the USPS wasn\u2019t run with the goal of bringing in a big profit. \u201cI guess that the postmaster general must think it\u2019s the Wild West, and he\u2019s the new sheriff.\u201dThe Postal Reorganization Act of 1970, he pointed out, requires \u201cprompt, reliable, and efficient services to patrons in all areas,\u201d in its first paragraph. The Postal Service is required by the Constitution to serve everyone in the country equally and with uniform rates. The USPS is the only universal provider of mail service and has been a low-cost anchor for the mailing industry, helping to keep private mail service rates down. A recent analysis by the Institute for Policy Studies found that, without the USPS, 70 million more Americans would have to pay hefty surcharges for deliveries. But the agency has been rapidly losing money since a 2006 law, passed with the support of the George W. Bush administration, required USPS to pre-fund employee retiree health benefits for 75 years in the future. That means the Postal Service must pay for the future health care of employees who have not even been born yet. The burden accounted for an estimated 80% to 90% of the agency\u2019s losses before the pandemic. Critics call the law \u201cdraconian\u201d and say that it was created with the intention of leading the Postal Service toward privatization. No other federal agency bears this burden. In a statement to Fortune, the Postal Service said that it was currently \u201cdeveloping a business plan to ensure that we will be financially stable,\u201d which will be presented to the Board of Governors once finalized and will \u201cfocus on the Postal Service\u2019s strengths to maximize our prospects for long-term success.\u201d But for now, it is \u201ctaking immediate steps to increase operational efficiency by reemphasizing existing plans that have been designed to provide prompt and reliable service within current service standards.\u201d Union leaders say they don\u2019t understand how plans to slow mail delivery services lead to an increase in efficiency.Dimonstein points to a decision to cancel extra truck trips from processing stations to post offices. Each mail truck, he said, can only hold so many containers of mail. When volume goes up, as package volume has during shelter-in-place orders, workers will make an extra trip to make sure everything gets delivered on time. Without those extra trips, packages and mail will sit at the station for at least an additional day. But as volume continues, a snowball effect occurs where days can grow into weeks. \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous. It\u2019s an arbitrary act,\u201d said Dimonstein.More politics coverage from Fortune:\u201cTrump troops\u201d in U.S. cities: What the law says about their rights\u2014and yoursExtra $600 unemployment benefit likely to expire before the next stimulus bill passesWhat Trump means when he says he \u201caced\u201d his presidential cognitive testWhy Republicans need a convention and Democrats can lay lowNo one tried to protect the U.K.\u2019s Brexit referendum from Russian interference, long-awaited report showsThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"}]}
