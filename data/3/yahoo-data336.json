(Photo: Getty Images)\u201cPrior to COVID, the industry was definitely in crisis,\u201d David Grabowski, a professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen understaffing in a lot of buildings, quality of care problems, a number of closures in terms of nursing homes around the country. And I would attribute a lot of that to the economic model that the nursing homes operate under.\u201dAccording to the Times analysis, \u201cthe virus has infected more than 282,000 people at some 12,000 facilities\u201d as of June 26 and killed more than 54,000. There are roughly 15,600 nursing homes in the U.S. with over 1.3 million residents and over 1.6 million staff members.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen just incredible shortfalls,\u201d Grabowski said. \u201cOne nurse aide trying to care for 25 or 30 residents on her shift, and just really dire situations in different nursing homes around the country due to COVID.\u201dThere is no federal standard nurse-to-resident ratio at nursing homes, according to Fierce Healthcare, and no current national data on staffing due to the pandemic.\u201cIt\u2019s the industry right now that needs support,\u201d Grabowski said. \u201cWe need more personal protective equipment, more testing, and more support for these direct caregivers. They need hazard pay and benefits, and we need to recruit additional individuals into this workforce. Because otherwise, it just can\u2019t continue down the path that we\u2019re on right now.\u201dCases are surging in the southern part of the U.S. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)How it all beganIt all began at the end of February when both residents and staff at a nursing facility in Kirkland, Washington began displaying symptoms of coronavirus.Story continuesBy April, two-thirds of the residents, along with dozens of staff members, tested positive and 37 people linked to the nursing home died. Now, the facility is facing a $600,000 fine after state inspectors found it \u201cdid not have an adequate infection control system in place and failed to provide quality care, among other findings,\u201d according to the New York Times.A recent NCAL survey found that many assisted living communities are running low on PPE such as N95 masks, surgical face masks, face shields, gowns, and gloves. And, more than half of nursing homes and assisted living communities have reported issues with lab processing times for coronavirus tests \u2014 87% have said it\u2019s taken two days or longer.\u201cYou really need those resources to manage the outbreak,\u201d Grabowski said. \u201cAnd many nursing homes in this country lack that. They certainly lack the PPE and the testing to keep it out. But then once in there, they really lack the workforce to manage.\u201dA stretcher is moved from an AMR ambulance to the Life Care Center of Kirkland where one associate and one resident were diagnosed with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) according to a statement released by the facility in Kirkland, Washington on February 29, 2020.

And because of the vulnerability of the population, it ends up being much more damaging than potentially somewhere, like for instance, an apartment building where the demographics of people living there are more heterogeneous.\u201dThe close environment makes it easy for the virus to spread between staff and residents.Judie Shape, 81, who tested positive for coronavirus, acknowledges press photographers gathered outside as her daughter Lori Spencer and husband Michael Spencer visit outside her room at Care Center of Kirkland. (REUTERS/Jason Redmond)\u201cIf it\u2019s present where your staff live, they\u2019re going to get the virus and they\u2019re going to unknowingly bring it in and spread it at the building,\u201d Grabowski said. \u201cThe way these buildings are set up, they\u2019re very clustered. Two residents often in a room, shared bathrooms. The nature of the care is high touch. This is bathing and dressing and toileting. Many of these staff work across multiple buildings, so they\u2019re not just spreading it down the hall. They\u2019re spreading it out to other facilities. Once in there, it really spreads quickly.\u201dNursing homes, both in the U.S. and around the world, have begun cutting off access to non-residents in order to limit the spread of the virus.Chan cautioned that this could have a negative effect on residents as well.\u201cWe also have to be careful for this demographic to not entirely isolate the older population within our communities, because that, from a mental health standpoint, can also be quite damaging,\u201d she said. \u201cFinding ways to continue to provide the care that is necessary in a safe manner, so maintaining availability of PPE is important, both for the providers but also for visitors.\u201dAdriana is a reporter and editor covering politics and health care policy for Yahoo Finance.
