Starbucks also recently moved to require face masks among its patrons.\u201cWhile we\u2019re certainly not the first business to require face coverings, we know this is a simple step everyone can take for their safety and the safety of others in our facilities,\u201d Walmart COO Dacona Smith wrote in a blog post.\u201cAccording to the CDC, face coverings help decrease the spread of COVID-19, and because the virus can be spread by people who don\u2019t have symptoms and don\u2019t know they are infected, it\u2019s critically important for everyone to wear a face-covering in public and social distance,\u201d Smith added.The subject of masks has sharply divided public opinion, and led to some high-profile confrontations at establishments that insist on customer compliance.In recent days, economists \u2014 including a few Federal Reserve policymakers \u2014 have linked mask wearing to economic growth, arguing they can prevent spreading, and substitute for the restrictive lockdowns that brought the economy to a screeching halt in the spring.\u201cWe know some people have differing opinions on this topic. We also recognize the role we can play to help protect the health and well-being of the communities we serve by following the evolving guidance of health officials like the CDC,\u201d Smith wrote.To help customers comply with the new policy, Walmart plans to create a new Health Ambassador role. This person will go through training to make \u201cthe process as smooth as possible for customers.\u201d The ambassador will wear a black polo shirt, and be placed near the entrance.Story continuesAt Walmart-owned Sam\u2019s Club, its membership warehouse, the club will hand out complimentary masks to members without one on hand.Walmart operates more 4,700 Walmart stores in the U.S. and close to 600 Sam\u2019s Club stores.Yahoo Finance\u2019s The Market Wake-UpJulia La Roche is a Correspondent at Yahoo Finance.
