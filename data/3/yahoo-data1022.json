And so right now, this very moment demands application. It demands more than just knowledge,\u201d she added.As George Floyd protests continue to roil the nation, companies have come out to show their support of the Black Lives Matter movement, often donating millions to racial equity initiatives.Nike (NKE) pledged $100 million to organizations that promote racial equality and social justice. Shopping giant Amazon (AMZN) donated $10 million. Facebook (FB) committed $200 million to black businesses.Saint John says that businesses shouldn\u2019t be afraid that their pledges will be mistaken for \u201clip service,\u201d encouraging companies to do something, instead of nothing.\u201cI am very much encouraged by the fact that businesses are taking this seriously, and that there is a reaction that is making them act now. I don't want to discourage anybody from action,\u201d she said.\u201cI think action is better than inaction, let's put it that way. And so for whatever reason it is that they are pouring money into causes and organizations that go to create equal justice and also go to protect black people, that go to defend black people, I am for it 100%.\u201dCompanies need to investSaint John also says companies need to be as invested internally as they seem to be externally.\u201cVery much like the investment that we're seeing to outside organizations, I want business to make investments in their inside organization,\u201d she explained.Story continues\u201cAnd so that means hiring practices, that means internships, that means programs to help inclusion and support once people of color are inside of their buildings, because we know that retention is a real problem and a real challenge.\u201dWhat\u2019s more, the C suite executive said, there is a need for allies within companies to step up and help amplify the voices of their colleagues that aren\u2019t being heard.\u201cWe've been talking for such a long time to the people who this system is not working for. And we've been telling them that it's their fault,\u201d Saint John said. \u201cOnly if they positioned it a different way. Only if they were more aggressive in their ask for equality, that perhaps, then, they would get it.\u201dBut that approach doesn\u2019t work, she said.\u201cI don't want to continue to put the responsibility on the people who the system is working against to try and fix it. You know, it's time for somebody else to fix it. And so I'm asking for our business leaders, I'm asking for our colleagues who sit beside us, I'm asking for those who are on their way in and up who sit beneath us, to use their own voices to advocate,\u201d said Saint John. \u201cFor those who are feeling very comfortable in their spaces, it's time to get uncomfortable and start making noise on behalf of those who you know and can see that the system is disregarding. If you want to know what to do, do that.\u201dKristin Myers is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
