He was right, again.Read more: Analyzing investments: Fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and moreNow, as the market recovers from a correction that saw the S&P 500 drop to a recent low of 3,236, Lee is naming a new line in the sand for investors to watch as an indicator that investors have overdone pricing in potential risks. So far, the index has held his line in the sand at the 62% retracement level of 3,224 from the August highs, where he would be putting new capital to work.Fundstrat's Tom Lee says his new line in the sand to watch is 3,224 on the S&P 500, which represents the 62% retracement from recent highs and the market pricing in the \"worst\" potential risks to the downside.\u201cOne of those things we have to think about is when does nervousness price in the worst that\u2019s yet to come, when do you think the worst is priced in?\u201d he asked in a Tuesday interview with Yahoo Finance\u2019s YFi PM, adding that recovering the 38% retracement of 3,363 would be a bullish trigger.\u201cI think stocks are not in a downtrend because, number one, there\u2019s still $4.3 trillion in cash on the sidelines,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think in the history of any financial market in the world do you ever have a top when there is 20% of the equity market sitting in cash \u2014 investor cash, that\u2019s excluding the private equity cash, the record cash held by corporates, too, so you got tons of dry powder. People are bearish.\u201dDespite the volatility that could stem from the election and potential second wave of coronavirus cases in the winter months, Lee points out that the economy has already weathered the greatest economic shock since the Great Depression and stocks have still managed to hit new highs.Meanwhile, analysts at Goldman Sachs also echoed the resiliency of stocks in the wake of the March selloff as well, predicting in a note this week that the S&P 500 could hit 4,000 by mid-2021 if the election results in a divided government. Lee sees similar upside given how the recovery has played out so far.Story continues\u201cThe U.S. is a dynamic economy and I think people underestimate that,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the short run it\u2019s very scary, but in the 2021 framework I\u2019m very optimistic.\u201dZack Guzman is the host of YFi PM as well as a senior writer and on-air reporter covering entrepreneurship, cannabis, startups, and breaking news at Yahoo Finance.
