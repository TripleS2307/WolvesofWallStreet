Pfizer led gains in the 30-stock Dow after the drugmaker and a partner announced a near $2 billion agreement with the US government over their Covid-19 vaccine candidate. And investors also digested a batch of corporate earnings results, and eyed a rocky start to talks over another round of coronavirus-related fiscal stimulus in Washington.China on Wednesday condemned the US decision to order the closure of China\u2019s consulate in Houston, which the US State Department said was a move to \u201cprotect American intellectual property and American\u2019s private information,\u201d State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said in an email.This came as relations with the US and China were tested further amid the coronavirus pandemic. The US Justice Department on Tuesday accused two Chinese hackers of attempting to steal data including US research on Covid-19 vaccines on behalf of the Chinese government.China vowed to retaliate against the forced consulate closure. China\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said in a briefing Wednesday that China intended to \u201creact with firm countermeasures\u201d if the decision was not revoked, according to a Bloomberg report of the briefing.The developments sent global equities and contracts on the S&P 500 and Dow lower Wednesday morning in New York, and both indices fell modestly as markets opened. The Nasdaq held slightly higher, paring some losses from the prior session.Internet companies including Facebook (FB) and Pinterest (PINS) extended losses, falling in sympathy with Snap (SNAP) after the social media company reported a smaller than expected increase in second-quarter daily active user numbers after market close on Tuesday. The results tempered investor expectations for the massive growth tech stocks demonstrated in the first quarter to continue at the same rate the rest of the year. Last week, Netflix (NFLX) had topped expectations for net subscriber additions in the second quarter, but disappointed sharply to the downside for third-quarter guidance.Story continuesOn Wednesday, more major tech companies are set to report quarterly results, with Microsoft and Tesla set to be among the most highly anticipated. Many Wall Street analysts expect to see Microsoft (MSFT) post another strong quarter of growth especially in Azure, its cloud unit, as many companies kept working remotely during the quarter and leaned on cloud services for day-to-day operations. And Tesla (TSLA) is set to be eligible for consideration for inclusion in the S&P 500 if it ekes out a GAAP profit in its second quarter, which would mark a fourth straight quarter of GAAP profitability. Shares of both Microsoft and Tesla rose in late trading.Investors also continued to monitor developments in Washington, with debates over another round of fiscal stimulus under way. The White House and Senate Republicans hit impasses on Tuesday, with the two sides sparring over whether or not to include a payroll tax cut, as President Donald Trump has demanded, or add more money for testing and to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, among other points of contention.Treasury Secretary and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told Bloomberg they are aiming to get a package through Congress by the end of next week, or the time at which current measures including the $600 per week in additional federal unemployment benefits are set to end. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, however, was less certain on a deal passing the end of next week, according to Politico.Wednesday afternoon, CNBC reported that Republican lawmakers are considering extending the boosted unemployment benefits at a reduced $100 per week through December, down from the $600 offered previously.\u20144:03 p.m. ET: S&P 500 closes at 5-month high, Dow adds 165 points or 0.6% as Pfizer jumps after vaccine dealHere were the main moves in markets as of 4:03 p.m. ET:S&P 500 (^GSPC): +18.75 (+0.58%) to 3,276.05Dow (^DJI): +165.47 (+0.62%) to 27,005.87Nasdaq (^IXIC): +25.76 (+0.24%) to 10,706.13Crude (CL=F): -$0.09 (-0.21%) to $41.83 a barrelGold (GC=F): +$23.80 (+1.29%) to $1,867.70 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): -1.2 bps to yield 0.5950%\u201412:44 p.m. ET: Stocks push higher in afternoon tradingHere were the main moves in markets, as of 12:44 p.m. ET:S&P 500 (^GSPC): +8.35 points (+0.26%) to 3,265.65Dow (^DJI): +69.77 points (+0.26%) to 26,910.07Nasdaq (^IXIC): +4.14 points (+0.04%) to 10,684.51Crude (CL=F): flat at $41.92 per barrelGold (GC=F): +$26.50 (+1.44%) to $1,870.40 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): -2.1 bps to yield 0.586%\u201411:20 a.m. ET: Stocks little changed as session rolls onThe S&P 500 and Nasdaq each fell slightly as Wednesday\u2019s session continued.
