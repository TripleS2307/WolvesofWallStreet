The market\u2019s helter-skelter tone is largely reflective of the competing impulses of a nationwide rise in COVID-19 diagnoses, and expectations for an economic revival.For weeks, analysts have lamented the dichotomy between Wall Street and a real economy. Yet Paul Schatz, Heritage Capital\u2019s president, told Yahoo Finance this week that current prices aren\u2019t actually disconnected from economic reality at all.\u201cThe market action is discounting economic activity 3-6 months down the road,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough short term sentiment is frothy...long term investors...are still hunkered down with cash in their bunkers with bottled water and spam,\u201d Schatz joked.And a closer analysis suggests that investors are less overly-optimistic about a \u2018V-shaped\u2019 recovery than they are taking a pragmatic view about political and epidemiological realities as COVID-19 extends its grip on the global economy. At the nexus of new outbreak worries and the market\u2019s head-scratching rally in the face of chaos, markets are betting on two precarious assumptions.They believe that rising coronavirus cases won\u2019t overwhelm hospitals that are now better prepared than during the first wave, and that virtually no political will exists for the return to restrictive lockdowns that characterized March and April.Jan Hatzius, Goldman Sachs\u2019 chief economist, said on Friday that there\u2019s \u201cprobably a high hurdle for states to reinstate lockdowns. Hospital capacity, not case growth, is likely the factor that could force state and local officials to pause or reverse reopening plans.\u201dStory continuesHe added: \u201cAlthough the share of hospital inpatients receiving treatment for COVID-19 remains low, we think these and related data are among the most important to monitor in assessing whether a state might pause, alter, or reverse its reopening plans.\u201dMark Haefele, the chief investment officer of global wealth management at UBS, wrote in a research note that rising COVID-19 outbreaks \u201care still small in relation to the capacity of health systems. Meanwhile local, state and federal officials have broadly rejected a return to restrictive lockdowns, he added.Given resilient consumers and progress on the development of a vaccine, the recovery will \u201cgather strength over the coming year,\u201d Haefele added \u2014 even if second wave fears ramp up market volatility.Cases are rising outside of New York. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)The \u2018jagged swoosh\u2019The downside risks associated with growing COVID-19 fears were laid bare on Friday, when Apple (AAPL) announced it was closing stores in some markets again out of \u201can abundance of caution\u201d \u2014 which sent stocks reeling.The dynamic reflects the market\u2019s \u201cnew phase,\u201d according to John Hancock Investment Co-Chief Investment Strategist Matt Miskin. He told Yahoo Finance this week that asset prices were likely to trade like \u201ca biotech stock\u201d whose fortunes rest on a promising drug.\u201cIt\u2019s a behavioral finance study. Really what happens is when you\u2019re investing in a pharmaceutical usually they start out by saying there\u2019s a lot of promise around a drug and the stock goes up a ton,\u201d only to reverse when reality undermines the optimism.Meanwhile, it's become clear that the happy medium between a still-raging outbreak and a nascent rebound is what analysts at Eurasia Group recently called a \u201cjagged swoosh\u201d recovery.\u201cThe interaction of the pandemic and the public policy decisions\u2026[create] a jagged swoosh recovery more protracted than the \u2018U\u2019 or \u2018V\u2019-shaped recovery that characterize more benign scenarios, and likely to be stop-start reflecting the differential pace or recovery across states and sectors,\u201d wrote Robert Kahn, the firm\u2019s global strategy and macro director.\u201cContinuing headwinds to demand and supply, and the resultant financial distress, contribute to sustained shortfalls in activity,\u201d he added. \u201cUnemployment remains elevated and it takes 2-3 years for activity to return to pre-pandemic levels.\u201dAddressing the prospect of a new round of shutdowns, Eurasia echoed a growing number of economists who suggest that scenario \u201cwill be harder to implement than we thought, because political support for reopening is surprisingly strong, and unlike in the early days of the pandemic the necessity for state-wide shutdowns...is seen as limited if viral outbreaks remain concentrated in small pockets.\u201dThat assumption is a gamble for both Wall Street and the economy. Because COVID-19 isn\u2019t going anywhere until a vaccine is found, the outlook will be captive to flare-ups in certain states, and the ability of public officials to contain the disease.Jesse Edgerton, economist at JPMorgan Chase, wrote on Friday that \u201cCOVID-19 and its effects on behavior remain the most important factors likely to drive the economy in the remainder of 2020, in our view.\u201dWith record hospitalizations and infections now dogging the Sunbelt States and California, even as former epicenters in New York and New Jersey decline, the bank \u201cenvisions that a patchwork of policy responses across states will be inadequate to eliminate the virus, leaving the fear of COVID-19 as a significant drag on activity in certain sectors,\u201d Edgerton said, adding that \u201crecent data on the interplay between COVID-19 and activity are consistent with our forecast for only a partial recovery.\u201d"}]}
