And it is still nearly double the 665,000 weekly claims filed at the worst point during the Great Recession in 2009.\u201cThe frustrating reality is that new claims have remained above one million since exploding in late March and having dipped below 2 million in late May,\u201d Bankrate senior economist Mark Hamrick said in an email. \u201cImprovement has proved harder to come by in recent weeks.\u201dMoreover, without seasonal adjustments, initial jobless claims rose last week by 108,811 to 1.5 million, marking the first increase in this metric since April.\u201cKey UI [unemployment] claim indicators diverged last week, with the seasonally adjusted data falling, but the non-seasonally adjusted claims increasing for the first time in months,\u201d said Glassdoor senior economist Daniel Zhao. \u201cThe rising UI claims add to the evidence that the recovery may be stalling and come at a critical juncture in the crisis as Covid-19 cases rise around the country and expanded unemployment benefits for Americans are set to expire.\u201dStory continues\u201cThe risk of a surprise drop in employment in July is rising, pointing to a rollercoaster recovery as the labor market starts to turn down again,\u201d he added.Some of the states in the South and West that have recently reported spikes in coronavirus cases saw increases in new jobless claims for the week ended July 11. California, which has consistently posted the highest level of new jobless claims each week, reported an unadjusted increase of 22,941 claims to 287,732, after reporting a week over week decline in the previous report.Meanwhile, Florida \u2013 another state contending with a resurgence in coronavirus cases \u2013 saw new claims nearly double last week to 129,408. Arizona also saw a rise of 4,483 unadjusted claims to a total of 30,257 last week. Many states, however, reported declines in new claims versus the previous week.Continuing unemployment claims, which are reported on a one-week lag, fell more than expected for the week ending July 4. Those claims measure the number of individuals still receiving unemployment benefits, and have fallen for each of the past six straight weeks.Continuing unemployment claims for the prior week were revised down to 17.76 million, from the 18.062 million previously reported.\u2014Emily McCormick is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.
