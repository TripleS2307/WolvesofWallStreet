REUTERS/Gary Cameron (UNITED STATES - Tags: SOCIETY HEALTH)The Commonwealth Fund defines \u201cunderinsured\u201d as someone who\u2019s been insured continuously for the past 12 months and their out-of-pocket costs are equal to 10% or more of household income, if their out-of-pocket costs (not including premiums) for the past 12 months are equal to at least 5% of household income for individuals living under 200% of the federal poverty level, or if they have a deductible that\u2019s 5% or more of household income.And while low-income individuals had underinsured rates twice as high as their higher-income counterparts, it\u2019s those with private health care plans \u2014 which includes ACA marketplace plans \u2014 that have the highest underinsured rates.13% of people were uninsured at the time of the survey. (Chart: The Commonwealth Fund)Uninsured Americans 'have a disincentive to get the health care'Those with employer-sponsored health care can still be considered underinsured, depending on how much they are paying out-of-pocket, and one out of four adults in employer-sponsored health plans qualify as underinsured.\u201cBecause there were an estimated 122 million working-age people in employer plans, compared to just 15 million in the individual market, there were far more underinsured people with employer coverage than with individual market insurance,\u201d the report stated. \u201cThe growth in the underinsured since 2010 has been driven by increasingly inadequate coverage in employer health plans.\u201dEmployee premiums and deductibles are particularly high in the South. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)Part of this is driven by high premiums and deductibles. Over the past 10 years, the number of adults in private health plans with deductibles of $1,000 or more has doubled. And while deductibles have been rising, household income has not been keeping up.Story continues\u201cPeople in employer-based plans make wage concessions in order to have benefits,\u201d Sara Collins, vice president at The Commonwealth Fund, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cYour health insurance is part of your overall compensation. So as your health care expenses go up, you\u2019re not going to see the big increases in wages that you would otherwise see if perhaps your insurance wasn\u2019t going up so much, costs were going up so much.\u201dAnd with insurance costs rising \u2014 which could happen even more over the next several years because of the coronavirus \u2014 premiums and deductibles are also rising.Deductibles have continued to increase over the past decade. (Chart: The Commonwealth Fund)\u201cWhat people are exposed to is increasing,\u201d Collins said. \u201cBut at the same time, their income isn\u2019t growing as fast. They have a disincentive to get the health care that they need, and so we see that people who are underinsured or who have high deductibles are a lot less likely to get health care because of the cost that they might face.\u201dThere is evidence to support this claim: A 2019 Gallup poll found that \u201ca record 25% of Americans say they or a family member put off treatment for a serious medical condition in the past year because of the cost, up from 19% a year ago and the highest in Gallup\u2019s trend.\u201d(Source: Gallup)Similarly, the Commonwealth survey found that 35% of adults reported either not filling a prescription, skipping a recommended test/treatment/visit, not going to the doctor when sick, or not seeking a specialist because of the cost involved. This is more likely to happen with those who have high deductibles of at least $1,000 or more.\u2018They\u2019re just highly exposed to the financial cost of that care\u2019Medical debt isn\u2019t a new issue to Americans, but it is an increasingly troubling trend.About 37% of adults with medical bills stated they used all of their savings to pay off their debt, according to the Commonwealth survey, while 40% reported seeing a drop in their credit score because of the medical debt.While some Americans put off health care due to cost, others take on the cost burden.And when they do pay for health care, \u201cthey\u2019re just highly exposed to the financial cost of that care,\u201d Collins said. \u201cWe also find that can have lingering implications financially \u2014 people using up all their savings, for example, in order to pay for their bills, or having a reduced credit card rating because of medical debt.\u201dThe survey found that 54% of adults paying off medical debt have debts of $2,000 or more. And, 31% incurred credit card debt while 25% were unable to pay other bills, like heat, rent, or groceries.Patient Sharon Dawson Coates has her knee examined by Dr. Narang at University of Chicago Medicine Urgent Care Clinic in Chicago. REUTERS/Jim YoungHalf of adults who were uninsured at any point indicated they had problems paying their medical bills. And even 25% of adults who didn\u2019t meet the \u201cunderinsurance\u201d threshold also had trouble paying bills. These issues include damage to credit ratings and depleted savings.There is also a racial component: Black adults at 45% are more likely than White adults at 35% to have problems paying their medical bills.The most vulnerable are those whose incomes are below 133% of the federal poverty level. This is partly due to the Obamacare \u201cglitch\u201d \u2014 a coverage gap that has left an estimated 4.8 million people uninsured in the 13 states that have yet to expand Medicaid.Adriana is a reporter and editor covering politics and health care policy for Yahoo Finance.
