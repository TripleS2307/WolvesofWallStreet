Penney, Lord & Taylor and Bon-Ton.But with the COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally shifting how humans shop for everything from appliances to underwear, the future for Macy\u2019s remains dim at best, retail experts contend.\u201cMacy\u2019s continues to pivot toward online, but unlike other online players they have the legacy business to contend with. Do I think they will be around in five years? I am not sure they will be around in three years unless they can address the core bricks and mortar business. In the current environment, I don\u2019t see how they can do that,\u201d said retail watcher and Tematica chief investment officer Chris Versace told Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade.To be sure, the storied department store did little on its second quarter earnings release day on Wednesday to stoke the hope and optimism of battered investors.Macy\u2019s second quarter sales plunged by about $2 billion versus a year ago. Execs were quick to tout a 53% increase in digital sales, but when you operate more than 750 physical stores with ongoing weak traffic that is a moot point.The company notched a $142 million adjusted operating loss compared to a $402 million profit last year. Year-to-date, Macy\u2019s has lost an astounding $830 million on an adjusted operating profit basis. Macy\u2019s reduced inventory in a bid to conserve cash, raising the risk this fall of letting shoppers down because of out of stocks.While execs stayed consistent in their rather upbeat message on Wednesday\u2019s earnings call with Wall Street \u2014 hyping up a new off-mall concept for high-end concept Bloomingdale\u2019s \u2014 several dark clouds hang over the company headed into 2021.First, new Macy\u2019s CFO Felicia Williams told investors at a conference back in June that sales may not normalize until 2021 or even 2022. No update on that shout out was provided by Williams on the call with analysts today. And Macy\u2019s declined to issue any guidance given the uncertainty around back to school and holiday shopping.Story continuesPhoto by: John Nacion/STAR MAX/IPx 2020 7/30/20 A view of Macy's Herald Square as New York City enters Phase 4 of re-opening following restrictions imposed to slow the spread of coronavirus on July 30, 2020 in New York City. The fourth phase allows outdoor arts and entertainment, sporting events without fans and media production.Meanwhile, as sources have suggested to Yahoo Finance Macy\u2019s latest overhaul shared in February \u2014 where it will close 125 stores over three years and layoff thousands to cut costs \u2014 has led to execution missteps across the organization.And then there is the Macy\u2019s balance sheet.To shore up its finances, Macy\u2019s said a couple months ago it secured $4.5 billion in fresh financing. Exiting the second quarter, Macy\u2019s had $1.4 billion in cash and $3 billion in untapped credit. But the company is now saddled with more than $5.3 billion in short-term and long-term debt. Its shareholder\u2019s equity account only reads $2.3 billion.One doesn\u2019t need to be a CFA to understand that ratio really sucks at a time where your sales have fallen through a trap door and may not come back to some form of normality for three years (if at all).All in all, even the magic of Macy\u2019s may not help it avoid the inevitable very soon.\u201cMacy\u2019s top-line profile remains constrained by declining brick-and-mortar sales across the bulk of its full-line stores, with increased promotions and growing digital sales pressuring gross margin. Larger picture and multi-year, discretionary dollars continue to shift toward convenience (Amazon) and Value (off-price), with lower visibility in the U.S. wholesale environment,\u201d JPMorgan retail analyst Matthew Boss wrote in a note to clients a few months back.Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
