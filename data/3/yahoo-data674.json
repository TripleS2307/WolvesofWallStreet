Being in Hanover, New Hampshire, the already limited choices for dining and recreation were no longer options, so she found it a great motivator to spend more time outdoors, and found herself gravitating toward the golf course.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely the best activity to do during coronavirus and it\u2019s the best time to get into it because there\u2019s less pressure to know the rules, etiquette\u2026Golf has gotten more laid back because of coronavirus. Because of sanitary reasons, we\u2019re not supposed to rake the sand or move the flag. It\u2019s easier to join the game and learn how to play it,\u201d said 28-year-old Kim.During this extended season of social distancing, warm temperatures and desire for physical activity, the golf industry has seen a dramatic resurgence, with people investing in lessons, flocking to ranges and courses and shelling out money for clubs and gear. What had been perceived as a sport on life support has been infused with a renewed energy, driven by young adults.Rachel Kim at the Montcalm Golf Club in Enfield, New Hampshire. She first got interested in golf early this spring and the coronavirus pandemic upended normal life. Now she plays once a week and is planning trips around the sport.According to research from the National Golf Foundation, there have been notable increases in participation among juniors and beginners, along with returners, as golf has positioned itself as a healthy way to pass time during this crisis.\u201cThe number of junior golfers (ages 6-17) could increase by as much as 20% this year, a potential COVID-related bump of a half million golfers by year\u2019s end. During a time when many other activities were on hold, including youth sports in many instances, we\u2019ve also seen increases in the number of beginning and returning golfers of about 20% during the first half of 2020,\u201d NGF editorial director Erik Matuszewski told Yahoo Finance.Nationally, rounds of golf were up 19.7% year-over-year in the month of July, marking the biggest increase ever for a high-volume summer month since NGF started monthly tracking in 2000. This reflects an increase of approximately 10 million more rounds than in July 2019. In August, rounds were up 3% nationwide over the same period in 2019, after climbing from a 16% year-to-date deficit on April 30.Story continuesForget bars, drink on the courseAs social circles emerge from isolation and people seek alternatives to crowded bars, restaurants or house parties, golf has been one clear beneficiary. With the majority of white collar workers still given the choice to work from home, trips to the range have replaced happy hours for many professionals.Dan Matthews, a 35-year-old producer in the advertising industry, picked up his first golf club in late July. His interest was piqued because he deeply missed the camaraderie of the workplace and it was a project he could focus on.\u201cI had some co-workers that decided to pick it up and I wanted to join them since they were so very encouraging. I was also looking for something to personally improve on that was more of a solo activity during the pandemic. This way I could do it more frequently on my own and it's an ideal sport to take up that is socially distant,\u201d he said.For Rona Li, 28, the main catalyst was her boyfriend, who started playing with her best friend\u2019s husband often. Initially, she saw it as a net positive for her and her friend to enjoy socializing without the guys.\u201cIt was our way to have girl's time alone. They can leave the house, and we can be at home. But that got old and boring quick. So the guys suggested we play as a foursome. You can take your bag full of White Claws\u2026 that sounds fun enough to try it once. So in June, we started going to the driving range, renting clubs, just to see how good we were. Then the first time we played 18 holes with them. We may have beat them for a few holes. The tides are turning \u2014 it seemed promising,\u201d she said.Granite Links in Quincy, Massachusetts (Photo: Rona Li)After that first round, spent sipping on boozy seltzers and spending time outside, Li found her competitive spirit ignited and her passion for golf accelerated quickly.\u201cTo be outside, to have Claws\u2026 that was our little activity. Since then, we have probably played six to seven rounds together. We even drove out to Cape Cod to play at a few golf courses out there. So now it\u2019s like let\u2019s plan trips around where the prettiest golf courses are. We impulsively booked a flight out to Hawaii in December...figure, why not?\u201dYuna Park, 30, echoed this sentiment. As her husband started spending more time on the course with her friends, she found herself wanting to learn. So far, it\u2019s been a frustrating yet fruitful endeavor.\u201cNow, that more people in my life are starting to pick up and with my friends and family who have been playing in the past, it gives us an opportunity to connect whether it\u2019s for a couple of hours or even plan for future golf vacations...after I get better.\u201dThe female driverAs women flock to courses in droves, golf instructors are seeing demand from the demographic in their students. Last year, 23% of on-course golfers were women, though they do represent a disproportionately higher percentage of beginners and juniors than the overall population of golfers.Rebecca Lee-Bentham, formerly ranked the No. 1 female golfer in Canada, says she\u2019s excited about this unprecedented surge in interest. Lee-Bentham has over five years of experience playing on the LPGA Tour. This year, she wasn\u2019t supposed to be coaching at all because of the busy slate of events. But because of the pandemic, she found herself with more bandwidth to work with students.While her student mix is a combination of first timers and others who had dabbled in the past but are taking it seriously for the first time, she\u2019s seeing insatiable demand for lessons from students, the majority of them under 40 years old.Rachel Kim with friends taking a break while golfing (Source: Rachel Kim)\u201cThere are lots of fresh beginners...the most I\u2019ve ever seen. And my friends who coach are all booked up. The ones that were struggling are now full with students. It\u2019s the busiest I\u2019ve seen golf courses and driving ranges. I\u2019ve seen a lot more demand from the younger demographic \u2014 kids, young adults and women.\u201dKim, the MBA grad, who is set to start a management consulting job in January, finds the clich\u00e9 that business deals are done on the golf course highly antiquated.\u201cThat\u2019s secondary now, a pretty outdated idea. It\u2019s a plus, of course. A lot of my female friends started playing because they want to be outside and enjoy the weather, be active, take on a new activity. It doesn\u2019t hurt that if I get invited to a golf outing at work, I can hang,\u201d she added.The fairway of opportunityWith the uptick in interest, manufacturers of all things golf have been reaping the rewards. According to a Golf Datatech report, U.S. golf equipment sales reached $388.63 million in July, the greatest single-month retail sales ever recorded. The research firm first started tracking data in 1997; the last time sales were even in the same ballpark was in June 2007 ($368.1 million) and June 2006 ($364 million), during Tiger Woods\u2019 pinnacle period of red-hot success. He was the top-ranked golfer in the world from August 1999 to September 2004, and again from June 2005 to October 2010.This is a massive sigh of relief for an industry that was in deep decline just four years ago (Both Nike (NKE) and Adidas stopped selling golf gear in 2016 and 2017, respectively). In August, golf manufacturers Callaway (ELY) and Titleist and FootJoy parent company Acushnet Holdings (GOLF) signaled the summer season was looking bright.\u201cThe golf business has been great,\u201d Ed Stack, Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods (DKS) CEO said last month after reporting blowout revenue and profitability, as customers searched for ways to get outdoors. Dick\u2019s, which sells golf equipment in its stores, also owns the standalone Golf Galaxy brand.\u201cThere\u2019s a number of young people who have come into the game because they\u2019re not playing football or soccer or some other sport... Men, women, and kids have really all jumped into this game and we expect that to continue through the balance of the year,\u201d added Stack.Three golfers play twilight golf after a long day of working from home in El Segundo, California (Source: Melody Hahm)Now as golf starts to shake off its association as a sport that\u2019s stuffy, white and male, there\u2019s plenty of room for modernization. During this time, as Kim has been playing more and more rounds of golf, she discovered a problem \u2014 and a potential opportunity. She and another female business school classmate are building a women\u2019s golf apparel line.\u201cAs I got into the game of golf, all my friends had the same complaints: \u2018I can\u2019t find any women\u2019s golf clothing at a good price range that feels youthful and contemporary. Everything\u2019s so pink, preppy, more targeted toward 60-plus year-old women. We want to design clothing that\u2019s welcoming that encourages women to play golf. A big part of golf is feeling like you belong on the course. We still want to look cute, feel good, that kind of thing,\u201d said Kim.Kim and her business partner are currently conducting market research and finding potential manufacturers in New York City with the hope of launching the direct-to-consumer brand in the spring of 2021. The goal is to sell an outfit (skirt and shirt combination) for $150.\u201cThere are a lot of golf apparel companies that have beautiful stuff but one skirt costs $150. A lot of people are not willing to invest that amount of money, especially if they might not actually know if they want to continue playing. The goal is to be versatile so you can wear the clothes on or off the course. Women don\u2019t love wearing collared shirts like men do. Maybe the skirt could be worn to brunch with a cute sweater,\u201d she said.Lee-Bentham, the golf pro, is excited to see more people buzz about the sport she has dedicated her life to.\u201cI love seeing the spike of young golfers. I hope it\u2019s long term but I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll fizzle out after COVID. But it\u2019s good that lots of people are trying it out. And golf was seeing a big decline before COVID,\u201d she said. \u201cNow you\u2019re seeing celebrities and other pro athletes taking up golf making it \u2018cool.\u2019 I love it. Now I\u2019m like \u2018I can fit in.\u2019 I\u2019m no longer an outcast.\u201dMelody Hahm is Yahoo Finance\u2019s West Coast correspondent, covering entrepreneurship, technology and culture.
