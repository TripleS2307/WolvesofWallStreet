And Bookies.com showed Biden\u2019s odds improving immediately following the raucous debate, in which both candidates took pointed shots at each other.As a result, several observers now think Biden\u2019s coattails are long enough to pull off a sweep of the Senate \u2014 putting the levers of Washington entirely under Democratic control. Smarkets estimates that outcome at 60%, which would diminish anxiety surrounding a contested campaign that drags on beyond November.As the incumbent, Trump has certain advantages to his credit. However, even as the economic rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic continues apace, the president has come under withering criticism for his management of a crisis that\u2019s claimed over 1 million lives worldwide.The halting recovery has been made more uncertain by a resurgence in coronavirus infections, widespread social unrest and deadlocked talks on new stimulus. Trump entered the debate on the defensive, and the event descended into chaos amid the president\u2019s testy exchanges with both Biden and the moderator.\u201cThe advantage was Biden\u2019s to lose and there were fears from a Democratic perspective that a bad performance would play into President Trump\u2019s hands,\u201d said Sarbjit Bakhshi, Smarkets\u2019 head of political markets.Story continuesYet Biden\u2019s steady performance \u2014 a sentiment echoed by a focus group run by prominent Republican pollster Frank Luntz \u2014 \u201cseems to have inspired some faith in Biden amongst customers on Smarkets,\u201d Bakhshi added.U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a news conference the White House on September 4, 2020 in Washington, DC. (Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty Images)The chaotic aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, combined with months of protests against social injustice, inverted what was once Trump\u2019s strongest incumbent asset: A strong economy and a stunning rebound on Wall Street from a deep sell-off in March.However, violence roiling major cities of Portland, Seattle, and Kenosha have scrambled the race, highlighting the president\u2019s emphasis on law and order.Indeed, that became a flashpoint in Tuesday\u2019s debate, with Trump attempting to link left-wing activist group Antifa to Biden \u2014 only to stumble badly when asked to denounce the Proud Boys, a male, far-right group associated with white supremacy.However, the economy, which remains surprisingly durable in the face of the COVID-19 crisis, may yet bolster the president. The economy created a robust 1.37 million jobs in August, and stock markets, while highly volatile, are still in an upswing. Simultaneously, the government-backed search for a coronavirus vaccine may yield fruit before year\u2019s end.Just a month ago, that backdrop had helped Trump quietly retake the offensive in several key swing states, according to a Real Clear Politics average.\u201cWith two more debates to go, traders will be factoring in an estimation of Biden\u2019s stamina as to whether he can hold the line against Trump\u2019s attacks, knowing that if he falters, he could end up boosting the president\u2019s hopes of a second term,\u201d Bakhshi said.Javier David is an editor for Yahoo Finance.
