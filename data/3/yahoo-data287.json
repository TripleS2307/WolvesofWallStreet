The service has been hampered by operational changes, and officials have voiced fears about a surge in voting ballots that they\u2019re ill-equipped to manage.AGF Investments veteran Washington analyst Greg Valliere told Yahoo Finance that lawmakers are already \u201cgetting an earful\u201d from constituents on postal flap as mail delays mount. Ahead of a closely-watched appearance in Congress, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy suspended planned changes to USPS\u2019s infrastructure until after the election, citing the \u201csacred duty\u201d of delivering the mail on time.Still, Valliere said \u201cit\u2019s not just the election, it's people who rely on the postal service for medication...and people who just want to get their mail. I think this makes it a more serious crisis for the president.\u201d He added that it raises the likelihood that Congress will pass emergency funding as soon as this weekend.Yet the integrity of the U.S. electoral process is at stake, and a growing number of people believe the president\u2019s salvos at both the USPS and the voting system could lead to a legal stalemate in November that ends up in the Supreme Court. On Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said that Trump would determine the general election\u2019s fairness after the vote.\u201cYou could make a case that Trump is trying to establish a narrative [with mailed votes] that he didn\u2019t really lose,\u201d Valliere said.Story continuesIn the event of a tight race between Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden, \u201cTrump can then say after November 3 that \u2018the reason I lost ...is because of mail in ballots in 4 or 5 states that were razor thin. So I think he\u2019s working on a narrative that could be the basis for litigation once the election is over, that could wind up in the Supreme Court,\u201d Valliere added.\u2018It\u2019s in [his] head that he\u2019s going to lose\u2019The postal service\u2019s long standing financial and operational difficulties have converged with a hotly contested election in which the incumbent is struggling to navigate mushrooming political challenges.In an interview with Yahoo Finance this week, Ohio\u2019s Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown blasted Trump\u2019s \u201cphony populism,\u201d as he argued that some Trump voters were \u201chaving second thoughts\u201d about sending him back to the White House.\u201cPeople are more determined to vote than ever before [and] it\u2019s in President Trump\u2019s head that he\u2019s going to lose,\u201d Brown told \u201cOn the Move.\u201d He lashed out at what he called the president\u2019s attempts to \u201cundermine the effectiveness and efficiency of the Post Office. It will all backfire,\u201d he warned.At the heart of Trump\u2019s demand that voters cast their ballots in person is the stark reality that individual states and localities \u2014 and not Washington \u2014 make the rules that govern voting.Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden and vice presidential candidate Senator Kamala Harris are seen at the stage during a campaign event, their first joint appearance since Biden named Harris as his running mate, at Alexis Dupont High School in Wilmington, Delaware, U.S., August 12, 2020. REUTERS/Carlos Barria\u201cThe president has suggested that exclusive reliance on mailed ballots will inevitably lead to a) more voter fraud and b) a delay in the reporting of results,\u201d wrote Thomas McLoughlin at UBS Global Wealth Management, in an analysis this week.\u201cThere is scant evidence to support his first allegation, but the second will occur,\u201d he added.On Wednesday, the Trump campaign sued New Jersey, in the wake of the Democratic governor\u2019s decision to facilitate both in-person voting and mail-in ballots. It served as a reminder that the president appears poised to launch a blizzard of legal challenges against a process that may favor Democratic voters, depending on the state.\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s razor-thin margins of victory in three Midwestern states in 2016 offers a cautionary note for the upcoming election,\u201d UBS\u2019s McLaughlin said. He harked back to the photo finish of the 2000 election that pitted former president George W. Bush against his Democratic challenger, Al Gore.With an estimated 75% of Americans eligible to vote by mail, \u201cthis year\u2019s election is likely to be the most litigated in history,\u201d McLaughlin wrote. \u201cBy one count, plaintiffs have already filed 192 lawsuits in at least 41 states across the nation arising from changes to voting procedures in the wake of the pandemic.\u201dAnd should the results in battleground states, which are already showing signs of tightening, end up close, \u201cis reasonable to presume that some states will be counting absentee ballots well into the evening and the following day,\u201d McLaughlin added.\u201cThe next critical test will come after Labor Day in the US when the two candidates face off in three separate debates. To the extent that President Trump makes up ground and the election is close, the prospects for a delay in an announcement of the winner becomes a real possibility,\u201d he wrote \u2014 with already volatile markets likely to suffer during the near-term uncertainty.Javier David is an editor for Yahoo Finance.
