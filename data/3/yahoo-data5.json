Overall, the U.S. averaged 13.8 billion-dollar climate disasters a year from 2015 to 2019, more than double the trend since 1980.LAKE CHARLES, LOUISIANA - OCTOBER 08: Local volunteers help board up a business ahead of Hurricane Delta on October 8, 2020 in Lake Charles, Louisiana.

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)\u201cWhen Hurricane Delta makes its impact in Louisiana, that will be the 10th hurricane or tropical cyclone to hit the U.S. this year which breaks a record previously set almost 90 years ago,\u201d NOAA climatologist Adam Smith told Yahoo Finance\u2019s YFi PM. \u201cThe science looking out anticipates we\u2019ll have higher intensity hurricanes.\u201dHurricane Delta, which strengthened to a Category 3 storm, marks the 25th named storm this season and brings the potential for destructive winds and flooding back to the Gulf just six weeks after the region was battered by Category 4 Hurricane Laura.In Wednesday\u2019s Vice Presidential Debate, Pence seemingly refuted climate change\u2019s role in intensifying hurricanes with his answer that claimed, \u201cas difficult as they are, there are no more hurricanes today than there were 100 years ago.\u201d According to Smith, that would overlook the direct trend that rising sea temperatures is having on bringing not just more storms, but also more powerful storms.Story continues\u201cExtremes have always happened, but climate change is making some of these extremes certainly more frequent and more intense because there\u2019s just more energy in the atmosphere and the ocean itself,\u201d he said.According to NOAA, 2020 has seen 16 climate disasters cross the $1 billion mark in total damages. With three months left to go in the year, that ties a record. (NOAA)The report shows it\u2019s not just hurricanes contributing to this year\u2019\u2019s $50 billion in direct climate disaster costs. The 16 major events crossing the $1 billion cost threshold included 11 severe storms, three tropical cyclones, one drought, and one major wildfire event.NOAA says the cost of major climate disasters over the past five years exceeds $550 billion \u2014 the highest dollar amount for any five-year stretch since NOAA started tracking the data.Zack Guzman is the host of YFi PM as well as a senior writer and on-air reporter covering entrepreneurship, cannabis, startups, and breaking news at Yahoo Finance.
