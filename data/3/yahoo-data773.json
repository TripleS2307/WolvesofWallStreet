And there'll be some that recover very, very, very slowly.\u201d\u201cSo we shouldn't let the general statement about sort of a gradual lift off at the right time mask the fact that it will still feel for some individuals and some industries very, very slow and uneven,\u201d he says.The July jobs report showed an increase of about 1.7 million nonfarm payrolls, a dramatic slowdown from the average 3.75 million jobs added in each of the prior two months. The unemployment rate fell to 10.2% in July but remained well above the low single-digit marks seen before the pandemic.Diminished progress last month likely resulted in part from a pause or reversal of reopenings in more than half of U.S. states, as the coronavirus worsened in regions throughout the country. States like Texas and Florida had to close bars over the summer after a surge in cases, while the ongoing risks of large gatherings have largely prevented the return of the performing arts and other industries that depend on a live audience.Story continues\u201cThe most recent numbers suggest that the recession was really quite deep,\u201d Ferguson says. \u201cIt's not clear to me that it's over yet.\u201dNEW YORK, NEW YORK - NOVEMBER 07: Roger W.

Disagreement between Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill centers on the size of the package, how much compensation to provide unemployed Americans, aid to state and local governments, and other issues.\u201cI would encourage Congress to continue to hammer out and to negotiate and to come forward with a package that is well-rounded and has a scale that actually has the desired impact,\u201d Ferguson says.Read more:Misty Copeland: Coronavirus will impact ballet for 'years to come\u2019Bill Gates: We should be able to \u2018manufacture a lot of vaccines\u2019 next yearJump into stock market expecting rise 'a fool's errand': Billionaire investor David RubensteinMichael Dell: \u2018Not enough\u2019 progress on diversity in the tech industryRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"}]}
