It's impossible to stay quiet.\u201dThe most glaring recent examples were in Georgia, where at least 260 employees in the state\u2019s largest school district were exposed to coronavirus and photos from two high schools showing lax social distancing amid statewide cases and deaths being near record highs.\u201cWhile we're seeing an exploding epidemic, especially in the Southeast \u2014 and that includes Georgia \u2014 this whole response in this county is irresponsible,\u201d said Saag, referring to a viral photo of a crowded hallway at North Paulding High School in Dallas, Ga. \u201cThere's no plan, there's just seems to be an open hall with students crowding one on top of the other... I can't think of a better haven for the coronavirus. That situation \u2014 it\u2019s like a Petri dish.\u201dWearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID19, elementary school students wait for classes to begin in Godley, Texas, Wednesday, Aug. 5, 2020. (AP Photo/LM Otero)\u2018COVID-19 will not be something we can stop. And we all know that.\u2019Children under 10 years old (who do not have underlying medical conditions) seem to be at lower risk for contracting coronavirus, the disease caused by coroanvirus, and generally show lighter symptoms if infected.But children over 10 years old seem to transmit the coronavirus much like adults, raising the risk for school staff.Angela Skillings, a second grade teacher in Arizona, contracted coronavirus despite wearing gloves, masks, and using hand sanitizer. In late June, a colleague of hers passed away after battling with the virus.Story continues\u201cWe are in very rural small town in Eastern Arizona,\u201d Skillings told the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis. \u201cWe only have around 300 students \u2026 Last week, we had four more support staff members contract the virus\u2026 that is a little over 11%.\u201dBringing students back will make things worse, Skillings argued, citing what she has seen during seven years of teaching young children.\u201cI've seen them pass everything around from pink eye to stomach flu to even influenza,\u201d she said. \u201cCOVID-19 will not be something we can stop. And we all know that.\u201dCases are popping up all across the country. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)Outbreaks arose across the country as K-12 schools began fall classes.In North Carolina, an asymptomatic fourth grader tested positive for coronavirus after interacting with an infected family member. Teachers and students at the school were subsequently told to quarantine for two weeks.In Mississippi, six students and one staff member in one school district have tested positive for coronavirus, resulting in 116 students being told to quarantine.In Indiana, two high schools shut down after outbreaks while others will continue in-person classes despite some students and teachers testing positive.Most schools in bigger cities were not taking chances: As of August 6, according to Education Week\u2019s tracker, 17 of the 20 largest K-12 school districts had chosen remote learning to start the school year.Universities, some of which will attempt to reopen campuses, are trying to implement strict rules to mitigate transmission: The University of Texas at Austin banned parties and Tulane University in New Orleans has threatened suspension or expulsion for students who attend or throw parties with more than 15 people.A sign reminding people to wear face masks is seen in front of a library on Georgetown University's main campus in Washington, D.C., the United States, July 7, 2020.

Runcie, the superintendent for the Broward County Public Schools, echoed that sentiment when he told the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis hearing that even one confirmed case in a school \u201cis going to create a climate of fear that it\u2019s gonna be difficult to have a reasonable learning environment.\u201dArne Duncan, the U.S. Secretary of Education from 2009 through December 2015, did not hold back when assigning blame for the situation that America\u2019s schools face.\u201cThe bottom line is this: If we really want, we want our kids to go back to school safely, the single most important thing we can do has nothing to do with education,\u201d Duncan told the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis. \u201cWhat infuriates me about what is happening today is that it's an unforced error. We're in this situation because our federal leadership failed us, period.\u201d\u2014Aarthi Swaminathan is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering education.
