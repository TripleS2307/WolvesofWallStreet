(REUTERS/Carlos Barria)John Kerry \u2014 former U.S. Secretary of State, Massachusetts Senator, and Democratic nominee for president \u2014 recently noted that Trump \u201cclaims to be a multi-billionaire,\u201d but added \u201cthere's no evidence that he really is.\u201dHowever, Kerry added, \u201cHe\u2019s been good at losing money.\u201dThe comments came during a Yahoo Finance Presents interview on Monday with editor-in-chief Andy Serwer. The interview was largely focused on Kerry\u2019s backing of KFA Global Carbon ETF, an exchange-traded fund which allows investors to get involved in the carbon credit market. But the discussion, like most conversations around the political world these days, circled back to the president\u2019s taxes.\u2018Fake billionaire?\u2019Kerry is just one voice in recent days to raise questions about Trump\u2019s worth. Matt Drudge\u2019s conservative-leaning site, which had a falling out with the president, asked if he were a \u201cfake billionaire.\u201dDoes Joe Biden have a higher net worth than Donald Trump? https://t.co/HUIh2TTqDV\u2014 Lloyd Blankfein (@lloydblankfein) September 27, 2020Forbes itself jumped into the fray to say that by its calculations, Trump is indeed a billionaire. It notes that the site tracks both assets and debts, and that Trump was able to hide operating profits, and in the process \u201cfigured out how to share very little of his fortune with the country he now leads.\u201dStory continuesOther recent reports have also noted that the president is still in all likelihood a billionaire.But Forbes has revised its assessment of Trump\u2019s wealth before. In 1990, they removed Trump from the Forbes 400 after an investigation revealed he wasn\u2019t as rich as he said he is. \u201cForbes fell for that ruse,\u201d it said.A \u2018national security story\u2019Kerry and other critics are also raising questions about the national security implications of a president deeply in debt. The names of the Trump\u2019s creditors should be made public, Kerry said, adding, \u201cSome country can hold him, you know, hostage.\u201dThere's evidence \u201cthat a considerable amount of money comes from abroad,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have watched the president's behavior with respect to Russia and President Putin, and it raises very serious questions about the nature of Deutsche Bank loans and other money.\u201dThe Trump tax story is a national security story.\u2014 Claire McCaskill (@clairecmc) September 28, 2020Kerry also pointed out that if Trump is reelected, his \u201clenders could be placed in the unprecedented position of weighing whether to foreclose on a sitting president.\u201dSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has made similar comments in recent days. \u201cThe public has a right to know,\u201d she said during a television interview.Kerry is pushing hard for Biden to get elected in November but wrapped up the conversation by reflecting on his own 2004 run for the presidency.\u201cI was allegedly winning, and our polls showed that I was winning in the last week,\u201d he said of his run against George W. Bush, the last time a Democrat challenged an incumbent Republican president.\u201cAm I sanguine? No, not in the least,\u201d he said about the upcoming election, adding, \u201cNobody in the Biden campaign is taking anything for granted.\u201dBen Werschkul is a producer for Yahoo Finance in Washington, D.C.Read more:Trump's past tweets slammed others for not paying enough taxes and claimed he pays 'more'Tuesday\u2019s debate could determine whether Trump\u2019s taxes matter on Election DayTrump reportedly paid no federal tax in 10 of the last 15 years: 75 million of Americans pay no federal income tax \u2014 here\u2019s whyRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit."}]}
