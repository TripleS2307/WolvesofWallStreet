Hours after the video went online, Donald Trump Jr., conservative outlet Breitbart, and Trump had promoted it, among many others.\u201cIt is really hard to believe that that's what's being retweeted,\u201d Gates says.The video reached more than 20 million Facebook users before the company removed it, NBC News reported. YouTube also removed the video from its platform.Gates acknowledged that the rapid spread of the video made it difficult for social media platforms to contain but also said the incident illustrates a persistent shortcoming of the platforms.Story continues\u201cTheir ability to stop things before they become widespread,\u201d he says. \u201cThey probably should have improved that.\u201dThe criticism came a day before testimony from Facebook (FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg in front of the House Judiciary\u2019s antitrust subcommittee, where he\u2019s likely to face questions on a host of issues, including misinformation. Amazon (AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai will also appear virtually at the hearing on Wednesday.Gates, who serves as co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, made the remarks in an episode of Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cInfluencers with Andy Serwer,\u201d a weekly interview series with leaders in business, politics, and entertainment.Until 2000, Gates led personal computing giant Microsoft. That year, he and his wife co-founded their foundation, which now employs nearly 1,500 people and boasts an endowment of $46.8 billion.A debunked conspiracy theory about Gates accuses him of seeking to develop and distribute a coronavirus vaccine in order to plant tracking devices in billions of recipients. Nearly half of Republicans believe the theory to be true, according to a Yahoo News/YouGov poll conducted in May.Gates attributed the spread of the conspiracy theory in part to social media. \u201cLies travel faster than the truth,\u201d he says. \u201cParticularly in the age of social media.\u201d\u201cThe fact that our foundation is involved in vaccines \u2013 that's true,\u201d he says.\u201cThey just inverted it to say that somehow we're not trying to save lives \u2014 [that] instead of giving money, we're trying to make money,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate.\u201dRead more:Bill Gates: U.S. \u2018sadly\u2019 not taking coronavirus \u2018seriously\u2019'Travel has changed forever': Airbnb CEO Brian CheskyJump into stock market expecting rise 'a fool's errand': Billionaire investor David RubensteinBusiness leaders fear 'flaming on social media' if they criticize Trump: Fast Company Editor-in-ChiefMichael Dell: \u2018Not enough\u2019 progress on diversity in the tech industry\u2018We may need to quarantine our books' when libraries reopen, New York Public Library CEO saysRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"}]}
