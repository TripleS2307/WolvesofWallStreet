On Monday, he appeared on CNN and called for the sport to rid itself of Confederate flags, which have long been a staple of NASCAR telecasts, toted by fans, worn on shirts and hats, and emblazoned on RVs in parking lots.\u201cNo one should feel uncomfortable when they come to a NASCAR race,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cSo it starts with Confederate flags. Get them out of here.\u201dJust two days later, on Wednesday, NASCAR took action. It banned Confederate flags at its events.\u201cThe presence of the confederate flag at NASCAR events runs contrary to our commitment to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all fans, our competitors, and our industry,\u201d NASCAR said in a statement. \u201cThe display of the confederate flag will be prohibited from all NASCAR events and properties.\u201dESPN\u2019s Ryan McGee called it a \u201cone-man campaign.\u201d And just hours after NASCAR\u2019s announcement, Wallace raced at Martinsville Speedway in Virginia on Wednesday in an all-black #BlackLivesMatter car and pulled off his best-ever finish (No. 11) at the course. He called it the \u201cbiggest race of my career.\u201dSure, fallout may come. Some NASCAR fans won\u2019t like it. (Recall when some NFL fans threatened to boycott the league amid the kneeling protests a few seasons ago.) Ray Ciccarelli, a NASCAR Truck Series driver, posted on Facebook that he will leave the sport after the 2020 season because of NASCAR\u2019s decision: \u201cI don\u2019t believe in kneeling during Anthem nor taken ppl right to fly whatever flag they love. I could care less about the Confederate Flag but there are ppl that do and it doesn\u2019t make them a racist all you are doing is fu**ing one group to cater to another and I ain\u2019t spend the money we are to participate in any political BS.\u201dStory continuesBut the sport is likely to see more praise than criticism for finally taking action. McGee, who has covered the sport for more than two decades, wrote: \u201cI am 100 percent confident that a real NASCAR fan has the ability to enjoy a weekend in the infield just as much while flying an American flag as they do under the flag of a misguided, defeated nation that hasn't existed for 155 years. If they can't, then they've never loved NASCAR as much they have always claimed.\u201dMARTINSVILLE, VIRGINIA - JUNE 10: Bubba Wallace, driver of the #43 Richard Petty Motorsports Chevrolet, wears a \"I Can't Breathee - Black Lives Matter\" t-shirt under his fire suit in solidarity with protesters around the world taking to the streets after the death of George Floyd on May 25, speaks to the media prior to the NASCAR Cup Series Blue-Emu Maximum Pain Relief 500 at Martinsville Speedway on June 10, 2020 in Martinsville, Virginia. (Photo by Jared C. Tilton/Getty Images)NASCAR\u2019s action is one of many big moves adding fuel to the broader reckoning in America: sports leagues and corporations, news outlets and even bands, are cleaning up their act and publicly investigating their own racial insensitivity or institutional racism.Lady Antebellum, a hugely popular Grammy-winning country band, announced on Thursday that they are changing their name to Lady A, a nickname many fans had already used for the band for short. There\u2019s major overlap between NASCAR fans and country music fans; Lady Antebellum performed the pre-race show before the 2017 Daytona 500.\u201cWe\u2019ve watched and listened more than ever these last few weeks, and our hearts have been stirred with conviction... We named our band after the Southern \u2018antebellum\u2019 style home where we took our first photos. As musicians, it reminded us of all the music born in the South that influenced us... We did not take into account the associations that weigh down this word referring to the period of history before the Civil War, which includes slavery. We are deeply sorry for the hurt this has caused... Today, we speak up and make a change. We hope you will dig in and join us.\u201dNo doubt the band, like NASCAR, stands to lose some fans who don\u2019t approve of the decision.But like the NFL, which reportedly plans to allow kneeling protests this coming season, and like Nike, which endorsed Colin Kaepernick in 2018 and will donate $140 million over the next 10 years to racial equality and social justice efforts, and like Reebok, which dumped CrossFit over one offensive tweet from its CEO about George Floyd, the business benefit and reputation boost will likely outweigh any backlash.\u2014Daniel Roberts is an editor-at-large at Yahoo Finance and focuses on sports business.
