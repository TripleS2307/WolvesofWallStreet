The latter is set to expire on July 31.Congress is weighing an additional stimulus measure but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last month it will not include an extension of the increase in unemployment benefits. Nevertheless, Democratic leaders in Congress have continued to advocate for an extension of the benefits.Speaking in general, Braun lamented the inability of political leaders to reach compromise agreements to better address the pandemic.\u201cI don't understand how a virus in healthcare has become a political issue,\u201d he says. \u201cI don't understand how health is a political issue.\u201d\u201cI really feel at this point that our leaders need to stop worrying about just their base, and realize that we're now being put in a position by the environment \u2014 by the world, the planet \u2014 now teaching us a lesson,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt is kicking our ass.\u201dRead more:Fighting misinformation online is 'easier than people think': Steve BallmerBusiness leaders fear 'flaming on social media' if they criticize Trump: Fast Company Editor-in-ChiefMichael Dell: \u2018Not enough\u2019 progress on diversity in the tech industry\u2018We may need to quarantine our books' when libraries reopen, New York Public Library CEO saysRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"}]}
