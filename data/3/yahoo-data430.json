All Americans have a responsibility to protect themselves, their families, and their communities,\u201d CDC director Robert Redfield said in a statement this week.As mask-wearing has become politicized and transmission continues, several states have been seeing spikes in coronavirus cases and have had to reverse reopening orders.In the absence of a unified government ruling of mask-wearing, many retailers and big businesses are taking it upon themselves to keep their employees and customers safe and requiring people wear face coverings in-store, regardless of whether local regulations do so.People wearing facemasks sit outside a Walmart store in Washington, DC on July 15, 2020. Walmart will require shoppers to wear face masks starting next week, the US retail giant announced.

To help bring consistency across stores and clubs, we will require all shoppers to wear a face covering starting Monday, July 20. This will give us time to inform customers and members of the changes, post signage and train associates on the new protocols.\u201d \u2014 WalmartStarbucks - 15,257 locations\u201cIn its continued effort in prioritizing the health and well-being of partners (employees) and customers, Starbucks today announced that beginning on July 15, it will be requiring customers to wear facial coverings while visiting all company-owned caf\u00e9 locations in the US.\u201d \u2014 StarbucksBest Buy - more than 900 locationsStory continues\u201cAs COVID-19 cases continue to rise throughout the country, Best Buy is joining many retailers by requiring all customers to wear face coverings when shopping in all our stores.\u201d \u2014 Best BuyBJ\u2019s Wholesale Club - 216 locations\u201cEffective Monday, July 20, 2020, anyone entering a BJ\u2019s location will be required to wear a facial covering that covers both the mouth and nose at all times while shopping in our Clubs.
