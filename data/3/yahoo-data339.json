In a letter, medical experts letter asks Bourla to monitor participants for a minimum of two months after the second dose, citing a need for public trust in the vaccine.\u201cWe respectfully urge you to abide by this rigorous safety standard. There is too much at stake,\u201d the letter said. Pfizer has yet to respond.Dr. Howard Forman, a Yale professor and public health policy expert, told Yahoo Finance that Pfizer is in a tight spot, and could erode further the public trust.\u201cIf Pfizer would try to pull it off, it would look really bad now that Moderna has signaled\u201d by waiting the two months, Forman said.But in a letter to employees Thursday, Pfizer\u2019s Bourla appeared to indicate he would not be swayed either way.\u201cIn this hyper-partisan year, there are some who would like us to move more quickly and others who argue for delay. Neither of those options are acceptable to me,\u201d he said.In a statement to Yahoo Finance, Pfizer said the company is actively working on a response to the letter from heath experts.Story continues\u201cPfizer is very appreciative for the kind words fo the public health experts about our progress,\u201d the statement said.\u201cWe are committed to providing sufficient efficacy and safety data to help FDA determine the best regulatory mechanism for making the vaccine available to the public. We look forward to reviewing the new FDA guidelines once they are published.\u201dBut all indications from the White House point to the guidelines likely never being published, according to a Wall Street Journal report.There are over 7 million cases in the U.S. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)Forman echoed the concerns of other health experts worried about any movement on or before early November, a benchmark repeatedly touted by Trump. At Tuesday\u2019s first presidential debate, the president floated the idea once more.\u201cI've spoken to the companies and we can have it a lot sooner,\u201d Trump said, bemoaning how the issue has become \u201cvery political.\u201dTrump\u2019s aggressiveness contrasts with those from top administration health officials, include U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director Dr. Robert Redfield and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) director Dr. Anthony Fauci.Both have reiterated over time that a vaccine authorization by Election Day is unlikely. And in an interview with the Financial Times, Moderna CEO St\u00e9phane Bancel echoed Fauci and Redfield, stating that widespread vaccine availability is likely only in 2021, closer to the second quarter.More from Anjalee:Redfield: CDC 'preparing earnestly' for vaccine in November, DecemberIndia's tech giants navigate 'literally spiking' WFH demand, H1-B fears in coronavirus eraHow protests spurred Corporate America into action on race, inequalityRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube."}]}
