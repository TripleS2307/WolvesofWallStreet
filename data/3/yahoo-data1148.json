The team owner is David Tepper, the Carolina Panthers owner and founder of hedge fund Appaloosa Management. In a statement released by MLS, Tepper said, \u201cThe party\u2019s still on. We are just delaying it a bit to ensure we have the best experience for our fans when we do start playing.\u201dSpeaking to Yahoo Finance in May, MLS Commissioner Don Garber was honest about the revenue hit the league would take by returning in empty arenas with no fans. \u201cIt\u2019s not ideal for any sport whatsoever to [play in front of] no fans, I don\u2019t care whether it\u2019s college sports, Olympic sports, or the major league sports,\u201d Garber said. \u201cUnfortunately for our league, the vast vast vast majority of our income does come from game day revenues, so it has a different economic impact on us.\u201dLast month, on a media conference call, Garber got more specific, sharing that MLS expects a $1 billion revenue hit this year due to the pandemic.As for whether the pandemic would force the league to change its expansion plans, Garber was noncommittal in May, telling Yahoo Finance, \u201cThat\u2019s something we\u2019re working on now. There\u2019s no doubt that we\u2019re contemplating: Will there be any effect of the Covid crisis on expansion? Right now it\u2019s not really affecting that, but it\u2019s something that we\u2019re going to have to think about.\u201dStory continuesClearly the pandemic has hurt finances enough that the league needs to pump the brakes.NASHVILLE, TN - FEBRUARY 29: Nashville SC fans cheer before the game against Atlanta United at Nissan Stadium on February 29, 2020 in Nashville, Tennessee. (Photo by Brett Carlsen/Getty Images)MLS has expanded at a breakneck pace over the past decade.This year, new teams debuted in Miami and Nashville, though they each only played two games before MLS, along with all the other major sports leagues, halted play in March. \u201cIt\u2019s a hole in the heart of every fan and every club when you\u2019re not able to play games, in particular in Miami and Nashville, where we had our two new teams coming in,\u201d Garber said in May. \u201cThey got two games in, and in Miami\u2019s case not even a home game. In Nashville\u2019s case, their home game was amazing: sold-out Nissan Stadium with tens of thousands of people and all sorts of excitement.\u201dThe league will have doubled in size over 20 years, going from 10 franchises in 2003 to 30 by 2023 when Sacramento and St. Louis, the 29th and 30th clubs, debut. New franchise owners now cough up a $200 million expansion fee to join.Garber has at times been criticized for the pace of that expansion, but the growth has brought the league new fans, a $700 million jersey sponsorship from Adidas, and an investment stake in licensed sports apparel unicorn company Fanatics. In 2017, Yahoo Finance named MLS our Sports Business of the Year for its business achievements.2020, which is the 25th season of MLS, will not be as kind to the league and its franchise owners.\u2014Daniel Roberts is an editor-at-large at Yahoo Finance.
