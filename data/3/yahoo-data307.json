Here are a few from Colas\u2019s list.1. Plan before, not during a crisisThis is pretty much Planning 101 for anyone and anything, but Colas notes that many investors don\u2019t plan their downturn moves until they\u2019re in it. Mike Tyson\u2019s \u201ceverybody has a plan until they get punched in the face\u201d truism aside, having a winning approach \u2014 Colas\u2019s is buy every 5% or more drop during a crisis \u2014 has worked well so far for the last two crises.2. The stock\u2019s price changed for a reasonColas noticed that a lot of people attribute stock price changes to \u201cgeneral market action.\u201d Colas says hedge fund manager Steve Cohen taught him that there is always a reason, and the real question is whether it's worthwhile to find out, because that takes precious time.Goldene Symbolfiguren auf Finanzzeitung3. Policymakers play by their own rulesDuring the beginning of the coronavirus crisis, the Fed and the government did things they have never done before in terms of providing financial relief and stimulus for the markets, businesses and individuals. Colas notes that it\u2019s a rookie mistake when people say \u201cthey can\u2019t do that!\u201d They sure can \u2014 and watch them.Story continues4. Valuations don\u2019t matter\"Math is not an investment edge,\" Colas said Steve Cohen used to say. Everyone knows stock valuations, which are public. The important part is \"why\" it's cheap or expensive and \"how\" that changes.5. Misunderstanding time framesTwo of Colas\u2019s mistakes can be combined because they both involve misguided thinking about time frames. A lot of people say things like \u201cthis won\u2019t end well,\u201d and Colas points out that bad endings are usually just a potential starting point. (Obviously, in cases like Enron, that\u2019s not true necessarily.)The other mistake is using the wrong time frame of historical comparison \u2013 when people look at charts that don\u2019t match their particular investing needs, like a yearly chart of Amazon stock when you\u2019re considering investing for a decade or more.\u201cA senior Fidelity money manager in the early 1990s taught me a trick I use to this day,\u201d wrote Colas. \u201cOnly look at charts where the time period shown matches your holding period. If you plan to hold US equities for 20 years, look at a 20-year chart.\u201dThere\u2019s many more rookie mistakes past those on Colas\u2019s list, and Liz Ann Sonders, Charles Schwab Senior Vice President & Chief Investment Strategist, explained what she sees as the \u201cbiggest mistake investors can make,\u201d while speaking to Yahoo Finance. The mistake: taking an \u201call or nothing\u201d approach, getting in and getting out.\u201cInvesting should never be about a moment in time, that\u2019s gambling,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a process over time.\u201dSonders added that investors \u2014 potentially the new retail investors buying tech stocks \u2014 should understand that there\u2019s no need to find the best time to exit those positions, but rather rebalance over time to keep exposure where it should be for their individual circumstances.\u2014Ethan Wolff-Mann is a writer at Yahoo Finance focusing on consumer issues, personal finance, retail, airlines, and more.
