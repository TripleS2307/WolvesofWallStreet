Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted \u201cmany exciting things\u201d will be unveiled at the event, and Tesla watchers are expecting game-changing developments when it comes to energy density, increasing production and eventually lower battery costs.\u2018It will be insane\u2019It\u2019s likely Tesla will announce a new battery cell it has been developing in-house in Fremont, California, and details on long term plans to manufacture its own cells at large-scale.Musk recently tweeted, \u201cIt will be very insane,\u201d in response to a report of a leak showing a battery cell from Tesla\u2019s in-house manufacturing system dubbed \u201cRoadrunner.\u201d Electrek was the first to get its hands on the new cell.It will be very insane\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 17, 2020If anyone has seen this battery cell before or if you some information about them, please reach out.

Tesla also bought Hibar last year, a Canadian company specializing in ultra-high speed production of batteries.\u2018Million-mile battery\u2019Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities expects Tesla to announce \"game changing\" developments at Battery Day, which has become incrementally more important as competition in the EV space continues to ramp up.\u201cThe technology innovations around Giga/Fremont remain the key ingredients in Tesla's success on the battery front and we believe the company is getting closer to announcing the million-mile battery at this highly anticipated event,\u201d wrote Ives.Story continues\u201cIn our opinion this battery technology will be very advanced, potentially last for decades, withstand all types of weather/terrain, and be another major milestone for the Tesla ecosystem. In theory this battery will support an electric vehicle for 1 million miles and be a major step forward when competing vs. traditional gasoline powered automotive competitors from both an ROI and environmental perspective,\u201d he added.The Street will closely be watching efforts to reduce production costs as \u201cthis would give Tesla much more financial flexibility around pricing on current and future EV models with price parity,\u201d wrote Ives.\u2018We\u2019ve got to scale battery production to crazy levels\u2019With Giga-factories planned for Berlin and Austin, Tesla is aiming to get its hands on as many batteries as possible.In January, Musk said to investors, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to scale battery production to crazy levels that people cannot even fathom today.\u201dThe electric vehicle maker already has a partnership with Panasonic, making cells at its Gigafactory in Nevada. It also has a partnership with Chinese manufacturer CATL and a deal with LG Chem to make batteries for vehicles coming out of Shanghai.CompositionTesla watchers will also be looking for the possibility of a Cobalt-free battery. Cobalt, an expensive rare- earth mineral, is deemed a \u201cconflict mineral,\u201d as its mining has been linked to human rights abuses, corruption, environmental devastation and child labor in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which produces about 60% of the mineral.Another reference to watch for is nickel, a key ingredient in Tesla batteries. During the company\u2019s second quarter earnings call, Musk said, \u201cThe real limitation on Tesla growth is cell production at an affordable price. That\u2019s the real limit.\u201d\u201cTesla will give you a giant contract for a long period of time if you mine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally sensitive way,\u201d he added.The stock priceBattery Day will take immediately following the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting in Fremont, California, on Tuesday.Only a certain number of shareholders selected from a drawing are allowed to attend in person, and the event will be streamed online.Year-to-date Tesla is up 428%. The stock closed at an all time high on August 31st following its 5-for-1 stock split.
