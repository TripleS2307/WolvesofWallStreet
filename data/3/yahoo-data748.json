(Mandel Ngan/Pool via AP)Bezos responded by saying that he could not guarantee that Amazon employees didn\u2019t use that kind of information to create their own competing products. He went on to say that the company is looking into the practice.Representative Ken Buck (R-CO), meanwhile, questioned Amazon\u2019s alleged practice of hosting counterfeit products, an issue that has been raised in reports, and which Buck said could, in certain cases, lead to serious injury to customers who purchase such goods.Bezos, however, struck back, saying that Amazon is working to take down counterfeit products and has a division within the company dedicated to removing such items.Representative David Cicilline (D-RI) said that the committee\u2019s investigation has resulted in \u201cheartbreaking\u201d testimony from sellers who said they were pushed out of business by Amazon\u2019s competing products.Story continuesGoogle and Facebook\u2019s ad empiresPichai, meanwhile, was repeatedly questioned about his company\u2019s advertising business by Jayapal, as well as Representative Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), with Jayapal equating Google\u2019s control of the digital ad space to \u201cinsider trading.\u201dGoogle\u2019s dominance of internet search was targeted at length by representatives asking if the company favors its own products in search results, thus hindering competition from smaller businesses, an accusation that\u2019s been made by companies like Yelp and TripAdvisor for years.Google CEO Sundar Pichai testifies remotely during a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing on antitrust on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, July 29, 2020, in Washington. (Mandel Ngan/Pool via AP)Zuckerberg also faced sharp questions about Facebook\u2019s history of acquiring or copying competing businesses, with Representative Matt Gaetz (R-FL) asking if Facebook\u2019s operations are a \u201cdigital land grab\u201d that use the company\u2019s vast resources to purchase competitors in order to maintain its position as a social media behemoth.The company currently has 2.6 billion users across Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp, and is openly working on features that copy those of rivals Snapchat and TikTok.Nadler focused on Facebook\u2019s acquisition of Instagram, which the company purchased in 2012 for $1 billion, saying that the move was exactly what antitrust laws were designed to prevent. Nadler\u2019s point, that Facebook saw Instagram as a threat, and as a result moved on it, was echoed by several representatives throughout the roughly 5-hour hearing.Apple\u2019s App Store controversyApple\u2019s Cook saw only a handful of questions from committee members, but was stung particularly hard by Representative Joe Neguse (D-CO), who questioned whether Apple has to abide by the same rules as third-party app developers when it comes to developing apps for the App Store.Apple CEO Tim Cook testifies remotely during a House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, July 29, 2020, in Washington. (Mandel Ngan/Pool via AP)When Cook said the company did have to follow the same rules, Neguse revealed documentation showing that while third-party developers can\u2019t copy apps that are already in the App Store, Apple can, giving it an advantage over competitors.Cook was unable to respond to the line of questioning and said he would get back to Neguse.Apple\u2019s App Store is being investigated for operating as a monopoly because it requires sellers to pay the firm a 30% cut of all app sales. And since the only way apps can be installed on the iPhone is through the App Store, competitors contend that they are forced to deal with Apple\u2019s demands.Representatives also touched on a number of topics outside of the planned scope of the hearing, including platform censorship and cooperation with the Chinese government.Wednesday\u2019s hearing, however, is just one piece of the subcommittee investigation into the four tech giants, and even so it is only one of a number of investigations into the firms by the Department of Justice and state attorneys general.And despite surviving today\u2019s hearing, there\u2019s still quite a while to go before the companies find out the result of each inquiry.Got a tip?
