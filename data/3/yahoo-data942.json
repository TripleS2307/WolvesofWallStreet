At first blush, the reason for several of the double-digit percentage selloffs isn\u2019t so readily apparent. Walmart blew it out of the water with its second-quarter earnings release this morning. Consumers took their big, fat stimulus checks from Uncle Sam and splurged a bit on non-essential home goods and perhaps a few extra bags of frozen food.Meanwhile, Home Depot\u2019s earnings release Tuesday morning was no slouch either. Armed with rock bottom interest rates (thank you, Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell) and a ton of time on their hands, home remodelers sent Home Depot\u2019s U.S. same-store sales up 25%. A Home Depot spokesperson told Yahoo Finance the sales increase was its best showing since 2000.All in all, at least on paper not a bad way to kick off retailer earnings season this month. But the feel good news stops right there as both Kohl\u2019s and Walmart issued a dose of dark commentary on the current health of retail.Kohl\u2019s CEO Michelle Gass left it all on the field on her earnings call, saying there is a lot of \u201cdestruction\u201d in retail at the moment. Gass is right \u2014 the retail bankruptcies continue to pile up, pressuring those not close to going out of business. Even though investors know this retail death narrative, hearing a prominent CEO in Gass utter the word destruction \u2014 following a quarter where sales plunged 22.9% \u2014 is akin to yelling fire in a crowded theater.\u201cThere are literally thousands of stores that unfortunately are facing dire consequences and facing closures,\u201d Gass told analysts, vowing to go after that market share.Investors aren\u2019t so sure on that one \u2014 Kohl\u2019s shares were rocked by 16% on trading session.Over at Walmart, executives warned sales have weakened considerably after its impressive quarter as COVID-19 stimulus checks ran out.Story continues\u201cQ2 sales started strong, both in-store and online, particularly in general merchandise, helped by government stimulus spending. Grocery sales had another strong quarter. As stimulus funds tapered off, sales started to normalize, but July comps still grew more than 4%,\u201d Walmart pointed out in a presentation detailing its latest earnings report. The company was referencing the trends in its bread and butter U.S. business.Walmart shares were slightly in the red after popping by about 6% in pre-market trading.COCONUT CREEK, FL - JULY 17: A general view of people shopping at Walmart as U.S. corporations implement mandatory masks to be worn in their stores upon entering to control the spread of COVID-19 as Florida's Department of Health on Friday confirmed 11,000 new cases of COVID-19 in a single day on July 17, 2020 in Coconut Creek, Florida. Credit: mpi04/MediaPunch /IPXGiven this fresh round of gloom \u2014 and more probably on the way as retailers continue to report earnings this month \u2014 one has to wonder if the rally in retail stocks is as cooked as a piece of fried chicken.The VanEck Vectors Retail ETF is up 22% in the past three months amid solid retail sales data, which now appears to be well in the rearview mirror absent another stimulus plan for struggling U.S. households. The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund has rocketed 27% in the past three months. Indeed, that move higher looks overdone, too, if consumer spending is about to fall off a cliff \u2014 no thanks to bumbling politicians.\u201cBack to school [shopping] is a huge question mark. And it does raise the question now that people have paid their taxes three months later and perhaps the extra unemployment insurance of $600 is done, consumers are pulling back.
