SubscribeA vaccine.Since the market bottomed on March 23, the S&P 500 has rallied 49% while the Nasdaq is up more than 55%.And with the S&P 500 now within 1% of a record high, strategists have been writing quite a bit about the next catalyst to keep stocks pushing higher.And the most common answer seems to be a vaccine.Jared Woodard, a strategist at Bank of America Global Research, said in a note published Tuesday that a \u201cvaccine surprise\u201d is among his three big risks facing investors in the months ahead. A risk that could change the character of the market\u2019s current rally which has been centered on \u201cat home\u201d plays and big cap tech stocks. (The other two risks flagged by Woodard are related to the election and fiscal policy, in-line with what we highlighted out of Morgan Stanley on Tuesday.)\u201c[We] are all hoping for 12 months not 10 years and six vaccine candidates [are] in large-scale phase three trials, with some already entering mass production,\u201d Woodard notes. \u201cFinancial assets are not priced for a \u2018return to normal\u2019 in 2021 and the risk worth considering is that an early vaccine could spark a significant tactical rotation out of deflationary defensives and into cyclical sectors.\u201dAnd while it\u2019s only been a few-days-long trend, stock market action since late last week has been consistent with investors pricing in something like this possibility.Cyclical sectors like financials, energy, materials, and industrials have been leading the market while tech high-flyers have been lagging since the Nasdaq\u2019s record close on Thursday. Baird strategist Michael Antonelli also noted Tuesday that the equal-weighted S&P 500 has outperformed against the cap-weighted index for a month, suggesting a rotation has indeed already been underway. Albeit quietly.\u201cIn our upside scenario [for the stock market],\u201d said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer for global wealth management at UBS, \u201cwe think a combination of earlier-than-expected vaccine availability, increased fiscal stimulus, status quo in US-China relations, and an outcome to the US presidential election that does not lead to a material increase in corporate tax rates or regulation would lead to equity risk premia falling below pre-pandemic levels.\u201dStory continuesIn this outcome, Haefele expects the S&P 500 would trade at 3,700 at the end of 2Q21, and adds that \u201cOur preferred investments for this scenario would include select cyclicals and value stocks, and companies exposed to themes accelerated by the pandemic (such as digital transformation). We would also expect further dollar weakness.\u201dSo with outsized attention paid to a few high-flying tech stocks during the market\u2019s rally, it seems investors have begun to sour a bit on these popular bets. Perhaps not a total shock \u2014 just a few weeks ago we noted that while investors had piled into big cap tech names they also thought this trade was too crowded.In an email on Tuesday, Nicholas Colas, co-founder at DataTrek Research, also discussed the role a vaccine could play in the market going forward. Colas writes that if he were forced to say what moves stock prices in a single word, the answer would be \u201csurprise.\u201dAnd so the logical question that follows is \u2014 what would surprise investors right now? And the shortest answer to that questions is \u201ca vaccine.\u201d A vaccine that could, in turn, keep the economy growing over the next couple of quarters and therefore live up to the promise implied in the market\u2019s summer rally.\u201cSince \u2018Surprise\u2019 is the word of the day, we need to parse what fundamental factors make for earnings surprises from here,\u201d Colas writes. \u201cThe easy part: the US economy needs to continue improving. That means we need further fiscal stimulus ASAP and an effective COVID vaccine in the next 6-9 months.\u201dAs for the fundamental drivers of earnings surprises, Colas argues that increased demand, higher prices, or new products are the only sources of incremental earnings power for any company. A view that also complements what we highlighted from Wilson\u2019s latest notes on Monday that argued companies will benefit from increased operating leverage \u2014 and therefore higher profits \u2014 in the year ahead as costs are cut but demand returns. Wilson\u2019s outlook, in essence, says that the first pillar of Colas\u2019 earnings surprise framework is where future stock returns will come from.And the most likely path between here and there, it seems, is a faster-than-expected vaccine.So it makes sense that investors are starting to look at pricing in this possibility now. A survey from Deutsche Bank we highlighted late last month said some 56% of investors think a vaccine will be available within a year.Anything faster than this timeline could spark the next leg of the market\u2019s rally.And as we\u2019ve all seen play out during the last few months, stocks are always betting on some future, as-yet-unknown outcome. Wait for a vaccine, or better profits, or the realization of these fundamental earnings drivers and you\u2019ll end up being late.By Myles Udland, reporter and co-anchor of The Final Round.
