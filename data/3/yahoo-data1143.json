Excluding the impact from currency and business divestitures, revenue declined 1.9%.The company's net income fell to $1.36 billion, or $1.52 per share, in the quarter ended June 30 from $2.5 billion, or $2.81 per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, the company earned $2.18 per share, above estimates of $2.07 per share.
