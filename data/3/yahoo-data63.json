The 20-City Composite posted a 3.9% annual gain, up from 3.5% the previous month \u2014 beating analysts\u2019 expectations of 3.6%, according to Bloomberg. The results for the first time in five months, now include Wayne County, Mich.\u201cThe National Composite Index gained 4.8% relative to its level a year ago,\u201d said Craig J. Lazzara, managing director and global head of index investment strategy at S&P Dow Jones Indices, in a press statement. \u201cThe strength of the housing market was consistent nationally \u2013 all 19 cities for which we have July data rose, with 16 of them outpacing their June gains.\u201dFor the 14th straight month, Phoenix led the 20-City Composite posting a 9.2% annual gain for July. Seattle and Charlotte followed with 7% and 6% annual gains, respectively.\u201cA sharp deceleration [in home prices] appears unlikely despite the ongoing pandemic,\u201d Nomura wrote in a recent note. \u201cRecent data such as y-o-y growth in volumes of mortgage loan applications have remained elevated as reopening continued. Moreover, an insufficient supply of previously-owned homes for sale appears to have dampened the negative demand shock.\u201dCredit: GettyIn July, the median price for an existing home topped $300,000 for the first time ever, according to the National Association of Realtors. And last month, median price continued to climb reaching $310,600, up 11.4% from the same month last year.\u201cThe recent boost in the number of people listing their homes for sale still falls far short of demand from folks looking to buy homes right now,\" said Redfin chief economist Daryl Fairweather, in a press statement. \u201cUnfortunately, that means little relief for homebuyers, especially those seeking an affordable home. I don't expect the double-digit home-price increases to subside before early 2021.\u201dStory continuesThe lack of lumber as a result of the California wildfires has also been impacting the price of homes. \u201cOver recent months, we have seen lumber prices surge dramatically,\u201d NAR Chief economist Lawrence Yun said in a press statement. \u201cThis has already led to an increase in the cost of multifamily housing and an even higher increase for single-family homes.\u201dThe housing market is booming and has been a \u201cshining star\u201d in the economy. Existing and new home sales surged to 14-year highs in August as record low mortgage rates and a shortage of inventory fuel activity. Total housing inventory at the end of August was 1.49 million, down 18.6% from the same time last year and and there\u2019s just a three-month supply at the current pace of sales, according to the NAR.Even homebuilders are feeling really good about the market, homebuilder confidence reached an all-time high in September, according to the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI). Some homebuilders are even holding back sales to preserve supply for 2021.\u201cThe U.S. housing market has been caught up in a \u2018perfect storm\u2019 during the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d said CoreLogic Deputy Chief Economist Selma Hepp in a press statement. \u201cThe substantial swing in demand is driven by a need for indoor and outdoor space met by record low mortgage rates and a wave of millennials who were on the verge of buying \u2014 all competing for fewer and fewer homes on the market.\u201dAmanda Fung is an editor at Yahoo Finance.Read more:US home price growth unchanged in June; July new home sales highest since 2006Coronavirus finally slows down US home price growth5 reasons why the housing market has recovered from COVID-19: BofALuxury real estate may be back as the housing market recovers but bewareHome price growth accelerated at the start of 2020 before coronavirus slammed the USEconomist on housing: 'You can't buy what's not for sale'Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.Find live stock market quotes and the latest business and finance news"}]}
