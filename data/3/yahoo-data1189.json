They want to get in cars, and they want to travel not more than 300 miles away or 200 miles, a tank of gas.\u201dThe website of Airbnb on April 20, 2020 in Katwijk, Netherlands.

Chesky recounted his tumultuous experience in March, when the spread of the pandemic became widely known and demand for Airbnb plummeted.\u201cWe started the company over a decade ago, and I thought that was the craziest experience in my professional life,\u201d he says. \u201cFor many years, I said, \u2018I'll probably never experience something as crazy as starting Airbnb.\u2019 And in March, I think we experienced that.\u201d\u201cIt just felt like you're on a ship and you just get sideswiped,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt felt like everything was breaking at once.\u201dRead more:Anthony Scaramucci, Jerome Adams, top CEOs offer clarity amid crisisBusiness leaders fear 'flaming on social media' if they criticize Trump: Fast Company Editor-in-ChiefMichael Dell: \u2018Not enough\u2019 progress on diversity in the tech industry\u2018We may need to quarantine our books' when libraries reopen, New York Public Library CEO saysRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"}]}
