The bank provides this service for free \u2013 you still have $5, but in the market\u2019s view, this actually makes you richer.This week Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) saw their stocks split, so people who owned one share now find themselves holding four in the case of Apple, and five in the case of Tesla. The collective value of these shares, seasoned financial professionals and textbooks point out, has not changed.Or has it?On Monday, the day of the split, Apple\u2019s stock was up almost 3.4% and Tesla\u2019s up almost 12.5%. In other words, they are now more valuable than they were before the stock split. It\u2019s hard to say how much of the gains are attributable to the split, but a commonly-held theory is that the cheaper price attracts a wider swath of people who otherwise might not buy a single share for over $2,000.Billionaire hedge fund manager Leon Cooperman expressed his frustration at the market\u2019s reaction to these splits.\u201cLook at Tesla and Apple: Everybody understands that [stock] splits don\u2019t create value,\u201d Cooperman, who founded Omega Advisors, said on CNBC Monday. \u201cMy dad once told me if you gave me five singles for a $5 bill, I\u2019m no better off.\u201dCooperman recognized the power of the \u201cRobinhood crowd\u201d and its impact on the prices of certain stocks, and new data from Bloomberg Intelligence's Larry Tabb shows that individual investors' stock trading volume has never been higher, accounting for 19.5% of the market's trades over the past six months. (At times during this period, Tabb\u2019s data found, this number has surged to around 25%.)Tesla logo is seen at the Tesla experience store on August 11, 2020 in Shanghai, China.

Bob O\u2019Donnell, TECHnalysis president and chief analyst, told Yahoo Finance that the outlook has similarly not changed due to the stock split.Ryan Detrck, LPL Financial\u2019s chief market strategist, also brushed off the idea that splits add value, noting that Warren Buffett does not do this with Berkshire and that it doesn\u2019t really have a benefit.Story continuesAs an aside, O\u2019Donnell added that splits \u201cjust give people an excuse to consider making an investment\u201d \u2014 and maybe the only error the financial industry is making is the \u201cjust.\u201d What if it\u2019s enough?Across the board as many new retail investors get deeper into investing, it may continue to be a formidable force in the market. Recently, the social network TikTok has been a hot place for stock and investing content, and by no means has it followed any sort of orthodoxy, with significant amounts of content talking about stock splits giving people \u201cfree stocks\u201d and lessons on how to time the stock split for maximum gains. (Barstool\u2019s Dave Portnoy echoed this sentiment last week: \u201cWhy do I like when stocks split? Because you get double the stocks.\u201d)In the market, actual value (fundamentals) and market value (people have decided that the stock is valuable, no matter why) are not necessarily two distinct things \u2014 there is only one stock price after all. Perhaps the question ought to be: What happens to a company whose stock price is so linked to retail investor sentiment?--Ethan Wolff-Mann is a writer at Yahoo Finance focusing on consumer issues, personal finance, retail, airlines, and more.
