It is roughly equal to the population of Salt Lake City or Huntsville, Alabama.And it is still climbing. Deaths are running at close to 770 a day on average, and a widely cited model from the University of Washington predicts the U.S. toll will double to 400,000 by the end of the year as schools and colleges reopen and cold weather sets in. A vaccine is unlikely to become widely available until 2021.\u201cThe idea of 200,000 deaths is really very sobering, in some respects stunning,\u201d Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious-disease expert, said on CNN.The bleak milestone was reported by Johns Hopkins, based on figures supplied by state health authorities. But the real toll is thought to be much higher, in part because many COVID-19 deaths were probably ascribed to other causes, especially early on, before widespread testing.Trump said it was \u201ca shame\u201d the U.S. reached that number but argued the toll could have been much worse.\u201cI think if we didn\u2019t do it properly and do it right, you\u2019d have 2.5 million deaths,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House before leaving for a campaign rally in Pittsburgh. He added that the United States is now \u201cdoing well\u201d and \u201cthe stock market is up.\u201dHe also gave his often-repeated broadside that China was at fault for the pandemic. In a prerecorded speech to the U.N. General Assembly, he demanded that Beijing be held accountable for having \u201cunleashed this plague onto the world.\u201d China\u2019s ambassador rejected the accusations as baseless.Story continuesOn Twitter, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said, \u201cIt didn\u2019t have to be this bad.\"\u201cIt's a staggering number that\u2019s hard to wrap your head around,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a devastating human toll to this pandemic \u2014 and we can\u2019t forget that.\"For five months, America has led the world by far in sheer numbers of confirmed infections \u2014 nearly 6.9 million as of Tuesday \u2014 and deaths. The U.S. has less than 5% of the globe\u2019s population but more than 20% of the reported deaths.Brazil is No. 2 with about 137,000 deaths, followed by India with approximately 89,000 and Mexico with around 74,000. Only 10 countries rank higher in COVID-19 deaths per capita.\u201cAll the world\u2019s leaders took the same test, and some have succeeded and some have failed,\u201d said Dr. Cedric Dark, an emergency physician at Baylor College of Medicine in hard-hit Houston. \u201cIn the case of our country, we failed miserably.\u201dBlack and Hispanic people and American Indians have accounted for a disproportionate share of the deaths, underscoring the economic and health care disparities in the U.S.Worldwide, the virus has infected more than 31 million people and is closing in fast on 1 million deaths, by Johns Hopkins' count, though the real numbers are believed to be higher because of gaps in testing and reporting.For the U.S., it wasn\u2019t supposed to go this way.When the year began, the U.S. had recently garnered recognition for its readiness for a pandemic. Health officials seemed confident as they converged on Seattle in January to deal with the country's first known case of the coronavirus, in a 35-year-old Washington state resident who had returned from visiting his family in Wuhan, China.On Feb. 26, Trump held up pages from the Global Health Security Index, a measure of readiness for health crises, and declared, \u201cThe United States is rated No. 1 most prepared.\"It was true. The U.S. outranked the 194 other countries in the index. Besides its labs, experts and strategic stockpiles, the U.S. could boast of its disease trackers and plans for rapidly communicating lifesaving information during a crisis. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was respected around the world for sending help to fight infectious diseases.But monitoring at airports was loose. Travel bans came too late. Only later did health officials realize the virus could spread before symptoms show up, rendering screening imperfect. The virus also swept into nursing homes and exploited poor infection controls, claiming more than 78,000 lives.At the same time, gaps in leadership led to shortages of testing supplies. Internal warnings to ramp up production of masks were ignored, leaving states to compete for protective gear.Trump downplayed the threat early on, advanced unfounded notions about the behavior of the virus, promoted unproven or dangerous treatments, complained that too much testing was making the U.S. look bad, and disdained masks, turning face coverings into a political issue.On April 10, the president predicted the U.S. wouldn't see 100,000 deaths. That milestone was reached May 27.Nowhere was the lack of leadership seen as more crucial than in testing, a key to breaking the chain of contagion.\u201cWe have from the very beginning lacked a national testing strategy,\u201d Nuzzo said. \u201cFor reasons I can't truly fathom, we\u2019ve refused to develop one.\u201dSandy Brown of Grand Blanc, Michigan, called the death toll \u201cgut-wrenching.\u201d Her husband of 35 years and their 20-year-old son \u2014 Freddie Lee Brown Jr. and Freddie Lee Brown III \u2014 died of COVID-19 just days apart in March, when there were fewer than 4,000 recorded deaths in the U.S.\u201cThe thing that really gets to me is ... if things had been done properly, we could have put a lid on this,\u201d said Brown, who has no other children. \u201cNow it's just unbelievable. It's devastating.\u201dThe real number of dead from the crisis could be significantly higher: As many as 215,000 more people than usual died in the U.S. from all causes during the first seven months of 2020, according to CDC figures. The death toll from COVID-19 during the same period was put at about 150,000 by Johns Hopkins.Researchers suspect some coronavirus deaths were overlooked, while other deaths may have been caused indirectly by the crisis, by creating such turmoil that people with chronic conditions such as diabetes or heart disease were unable or unwilling to get treatment.Dark, the emergency physician at Baylor, said that before the crisis, \u201cpeople used to look to the United States with a degree of reverence. For democracy. For our moral leadership in the world. Supporting science and using technology to travel to the moon.\u201d\u201cInstead,\u201d he said, \"what\u2019s really been exposed is how anti-science we\u2019ve become.\u201d___Associated Press writers Kelli Kennedy in Miami and Tammy Webber in Fenton, Michigan, contributed to this story.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.
