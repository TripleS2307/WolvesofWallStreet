A pusher means a vehicle that was not designed to be moved by its own propulsion system. The Nikola One was, in fact, designed to be powered and driven by its own propulsion.\u201dNikola states the gearbox, batteries, inverters, power steering, suspension, infotainment, air disc brakes, plus high voltage and air systems were all functional.However it stated, \u201cAs Nikola pivoted to the next generation of trucks, it ultimately decided not to invest additional resources into completing the process to make the Nikola One drive on its own propulsion.\u201dItalian-American industrial vehicle maker CNH's truck unit Iveco presents its new full-electric and hydrogen fuel-cell battery trucks in partnership with U.S. Nikola, at an event in Turin, Italy, December 2, 2019. REUTERS/Massimo Pinca\u2018Rolling down a big hill\u2019 claimNikola says a video of a Nikola One prototype, which the short-seller cited in its report as \"simply filmed rolling down a big hill,\u201d was distorted.It acknowledged, \u201cNikola never stated its truck was driving under its own propulsion in the video, although the truck was designed to do just that (as described in previous point).\u201dStory continuesIt went on to say, \u201cNikola described this third-party video on the Company's social media as \u2018In Motion.\u2019 It was never described as \u2018under its own propulsion\u2019 or \u2018powertrain driven.\u2019 Nikola investors who invested during this period, in which the Company was privately held, knew the technical capability of the Nikola One at the time of their investment.\u201d\u201cAny reports intended to suggest that Nikola's trucks do not drive are erroneous, and recent videos of Nikola vehicles driving can be found here,\u201d said the company.Quotes by a Bosch employeeNikola also states the short-seller mischaracterized quotes by a Bosch employee. (Bosch is one of its partners)\u201cFollowing the publication of the short seller report, Bosch stated, \"Specific instances in the [Hindenburg] report quoting a Bosch employee were taken out of context,\u201d the report said.The statement went on to say, \u201cNikola and Bosch are aligned on the product roadmap for the Tre truck ... Hindenburg either recklessly misunderstands or willfully misrepresents the vehicle pre-production process to fit its narrative.\u201dYahoo Finance reached out to Hindenburg Research for a response to Nikola\u2019s rebuttal, but has yet to hear back.Tech newsletterThe company reiterated it contacted and briefed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regarding Nikola's concerns pertaining to the Hindenburg report.Today\u2019s response follows an initial statement released on Friday denying the Hindenburg report and calling it a \u201chit job.\u201d Friday\u2019s response from the company left investors wanting a more detailed rebuttal, and the stock ended 14% lower at the end of the session.Last Tuesday, Nikola and GM (GM) announced a partnership to make the Badger pick-up truck which will take on Tesla (TSLA) using the established automaker\u2019s Ultium battery systems.The stock soared more than 40% the day of the announcement.Get the advanced data and expert fundamental analysis you can trust with Yahoo Finance Premium.
