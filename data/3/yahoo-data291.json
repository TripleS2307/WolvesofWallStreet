The unemployment rate beat expectations, but the economic consensus left little to celebrate.As James Knightley, ING chief international economist wrote in a note early Friday, it's \"a long, long way from full employment.\"Pantheon chief economist Ian Shepherdson\u2019s one-line summary: \u201cMomentum fading; October will be much weaker.\u201dPermanent job losses increasingIn the last jobs report before the presidential election, the data showed many people had stopped looking for jobs \u2013 and were therefore not officially counted as being in the labor force \u2013 and that permanent job losses ballooned by 345,000 to 3.8 million. Around two-thirds of these permanent losses \u2014 which are defined by layoffs lasting 27 weeks or more \u2014 have come since February because of pandemic-related shutdowns.(Yahoo Finance)\u201cThe unemployment rate fell further to 7.9% from 8.4%, but much of this was due to a fall in the participation rate,\u201d wrote Knightley, who called it \u201canother bad sign as it typically indicates people are being discouraged from looking for work.\u201dHigher unemployment for Blacks and HispanicsThe unemployment rate improved overall, but it was markedly worse for certain demographics: the rate was 12.1% for Black workers, and 10.3% for Hispanic workers, compared with 7.0% for white workers.Labor participationThe labor participation rate now sits at 61.4% \u2013 it was at 63.4% in February. Unlike August, where the unemployment rate fell because jobs filled were increased (the numerator), the rate fell in September because the labor force decreased (the denominator).Because the pandemic shut or slowed down numerous industries like hospitality and leisure, Knightley said, many workers are still waiting for their old job rather than searching for new ones. While the old jobs aren\u2019t available, Knightley said there \u201cisn\u2019t much out there\u201d in terms of the new.Story continues\"This is the highest unemployment and worst economy for any president facing reelection in history and it will be a miracle if the incumbent can pull off a win in these unsettled and uncertain economic times,\" MUFG's Chris Rupkey wrote in a note.Employees walk past the entrance to Disneyland Park on Wednesday, Sept. 30, 2020 in Anaheim, CA. After suffering losses for months due to Gov. Newsom's mandatory coronavirus shut-down, Disney says it will lay off 28,000 employees across its parks, experiences and consumer products segment. (Allen J.

Though the year-over-year increase in wages was 4.7%, which sounds great, that's because many low-paying jobs have vanished, not because they suddenly pay more.\u201cThere is very little evidence of actual wage growth outside of sectors such as grocery and we expect this to remain the case given the slack in the jobs market,\u201d Knightley wrote.As Rupkey put it, the recovery is starting to slow, casting \"a pall over the economic outlook where millions of Americans are without hope of getting their former positions back any time soon.\u201dRupkey and others see further stimulus as essential.\u201cThe virus is in the driver's seat in controlling the speed of the recovery and right now the economy is in the slow lane unless Congress and the White House can settle their differences and provide additional stimulus to support those jobless Americans who have lost their paychecks and livelihoods and hope,\u201d Rupkey wrote.\u2014Ethan Wolff-Mann is a writer at Yahoo Finance focusing on consumer issues, personal finance, retail, airlines, and more.
