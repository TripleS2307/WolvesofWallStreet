Since founding Amazon (AMZN) 26 years ago, Bezos has been able to control the narrative, and managed to do so \u2014 even before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law.Nearly two hours into the hearing, Bezos was questioned for the first time by Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), who represents the state\u2019s 7th congressional district, which includes most of Seattle, where Amazon was founded. When asked whether Amazon uses third-party seller data for its own benefit, Bezos said the company restricts this, but added: \"I can't guarantee that the policy hasn't been violated,\u201d noting that it\u2019s a voluntary policy that Amazon has put in place.Congresswoman Mary Gay Scanlon (D-PA) used the pricing war and subsequent acquisition of Quidsi, the company behind the now defunct Diapers.com, as an example of Amazon\u2019s anti-competitive nature. Alluding to Amazon\u2019s predatory pricing strategy. Bezos claimed he didn\u2019t recall the specific details and instead claimed there are a multitude of marketplaces for diapers.Both Subcommittee Chair David Cicilline (D-RI) and Congresswoman Lucy McBath (D-GA) shared anecdotes from third-party sellers who described the \u201cbullying, fear and panic\u201d of working with Amazon. Cicilline said sellers told him Amazon was the \u201conly game in town\u201d and said one small business owner compared the platform to a drug dealer \u2014 \u201cAmazon strings you along for a while because it feels so good to get that paycheck every week. We called it Amazon heroin \u2014 you kept going, you had to get your next fix...but this person was ultimately going to be your downfall.\u201dBezos categorically denied these claims saying he does not believe this is a systemic problem and that sellers have other ways to access customers.When asked by Representative Jamie Raskin (D-MD) whether Amazon\u2019s voice assistant Alexa has been trained to favor Amazon products, Bezos said he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it happens sometimes. \"We do, of course, promote our own products, which is a common practice in business,\u201d he added.Story continuesBezos, worth some $180 billion, joined the virtual pulpit alongside Alphabet\u2019s (GOOG) Sundar Pichai, Facebook\u2019s (FB) Mark Zuckerberg and Apple\u2019s (AAPL) Tim Cook.Lawmakers derailed the hearing from the start, focusing on so-called conservative bias, repeatedly bringing up issues specific to Twitter (TWTR), even though there was no representative of the social media platform at the hearing.Bezos was the first chief executive to read a prepared statement via video conference. He spent his allotted five minutes sharing the story of his single mother, who gave birth to Bezos when she was just 17 years old.He ended his introductory remarks by leaning into a patriotic angle, claiming \u201cthe rest of the world would love even the tiniest sip of the elixir we have here in the U.S. Immigrants like my dad see what a treasure this country is\u2014they have perspective and can often see it even more clearly than those of us who were lucky enough to be born here. It\u2019s still Day One for this country, and even in the face of today\u2019s humbling challenges, I have never been more optimistic about our future.\u201dNobody going after Bezos. They all want invites to coolest parties in DC (low bar) hosted by wealthiest man in world in midst of mother of all mid-life crises. I'd like to roll w/Jeff, and I don't like him.\u2014 Scott Galloway (@profgalloway) July 29, 2020When you\u2019re the world\u2019s richest person and waiting for your turn to be questioned by Congress. pic.twitter.com/QQgmcb8efu\u2014 CNET (@CNET) July 29, 2020Melody Hahm is Yahoo Finance\u2019s West Coast correspondent, covering entrepreneurship, technology and culture.
