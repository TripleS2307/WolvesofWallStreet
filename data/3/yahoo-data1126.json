The former vice president has put forth reversing half of President Trump\u2019s signature tax cuts, lifting the statutory rate to 28% from 21%.McShane stress tested her model and uncovered 16 consumer companies at risk from a Biden tax hike.\u201cIn order to assess the impact this potential change could have on our U.S. consumer coverage, we raise each company\u2019s effective tax rate by 85% of the proposed rate increase, making the assumption that ~85% of corporate tax receipts are at the federal level (based on our assessment of individual company taxes), with the remainder relating to state taxes (which we assume would remain unchanged). In this regard, The Container Store, Grocery Outlet Holding, Jack in the Box, Big Lots, Boston Beer, Albertston\u2019s Companies, Sprouts Farmers Market, Wingstop, BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club, Ollie\u2019s Bargain Outlet Holdings, Seaworld, Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, Nordstrom, Ross Stores, Kohl\u2019s, and Advance Auto Parts.\u201dThe analyst notes her consumer coverage benefited greatly from Trump\u2019s signature tax cuts.Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden pauses during a virtual grassroots fundraiser at the Hotel DuPont in Wilmington, Del., Wednesday, Aug. 12, 2020. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)\u201cWhile we acknowledge that YoY change in earnings was likely attributed to more than just a reduction in the tax rate (i.e. company-specific idiosyncratic factors such as growth, execution etc.) the magnitude of the change in the tax rate was a significant driver of earnings expansion nonetheless. With that parameter in mind, we believe the greater the decline in tax rate a company witnessed, the more risk it faces if tax rates move higher,\u201d McShane said.Despite the threat of higher taxes from Biden, investors have ignored the possibility. McShane\u2019s work shows resilient consumer stocks as seen through the options market.Story continues\u201cWe also find investors have not sufficiently priced-in a higher increase in volatility for names expected to be most impacted, should there be higher corporate taxes. As we get closer to the elections, we expect option prices on these names to increasingly reflect higher potential volatility,\u201d McShane warns.Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
