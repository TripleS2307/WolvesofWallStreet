Now that their children are grown, the Murrens plan to downsize from their 13,000-square-foot, five-bedroom, three-bathroom mansion, said broker Ivan Sher, principal of The Ivan Sher Group of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Nevada Properties, who listed the home for sale on July 7.Former MGM Resorts International CEO Jim Murren has put his Las Vegas home up for sale.

It\u2019s a home for entertaining, but this is also where the Murrens raised their family,\u201d said Sher.The mansion is made of glass, concrete and steel, and its floor-to-ceiling windows offer some of the most striking views in the Las Vegas area. It has five half-bathrooms, a half-basketball course, a fitness room, an office, an in-home movie theater and a wine cellar. It is a 1.5 acre property in The Ridges, an exclusive community in the Red Rock Canyon.Former MGM Resorts International CEO Jim Murren has put his Las Vegas home up for sale.

Outside, the private terrace has a spa, a Zen garden, a jacuzzi, a cold plunge and a pool \u2014 plus an outdoor kitchen and surround-sound audio system. And a patio extends around the outside of the house with steel overhangs for shade.\u201cIn the desert, you need to have shaded areas,\u201d said Sher. The desert landscape, designed by Sage Design Studios and the Las Vegas Springs Preserve, offers walking paths throughout the property.Story continuesFormer MGM Resorts International CEO Jim Murren has put his Las Vegas home up for sale.

But if the art installation is to stay, the buyer will have to negotiate with the Murrens separately. If the Murrens decide to take the lights with them, the bunker could be transformed into a meditative space or collapsed. The value of the experiential sculpture is in the seven figures, said Sher.\u201cIt is absolutely unreal,\u201d said Sher about the installation. \u201cThe experience feels like complete serenity. Sunrise and sunset are the only times it is supposed to be experienced, and as the light changes outside, the experience changes inside. It is meditative, relaxing and unique.\u201dFormer MGM Resorts International CEO Jim Murren has put his Las Vegas home up for sale.
