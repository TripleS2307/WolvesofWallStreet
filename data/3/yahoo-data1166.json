With the industry at a standstill that\u2019s costing Tinseltown billions, theaters and other entertainment venues are desperate to lure in as many paying patrons as possible \u2014 especially with lockdowns being relaxed.However, the crisis\u2019 toll continues to mount. On Monday, the Oscars was officially postponed from February 28, 2021 to April 25, 2021, due to COVID-19 disruptions. The Academy also extended its eligibility window through Feb. 28, 2021, as studios continue to remain conservative on releasing big-budget films.\u201cFor over a century, movies have played an important role in comforting, inspiring, and entertaining us during the darkest of times. They certainly have this year,\u201d Academy president David Rubin and CEO Dawn Hudson said in a joint statement.\u201cOur hope, in extending the eligibility period and our awards date, is to provide the flexibility filmmakers need to finish and release their films without being penalized for something beyond anyone\u2019s control,\u201d the duo added.Story continuesStill, with many blockbusters skipping the summer season entirely, two major tentpoles \u2014 Disney\u2019s live-action \u201cMulan\u201d and Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cTenet\u201d \u2014 are still holding out hope for July releases.\u201cTenet\u201d, which was originally scheduled to debut July 17th, pushed back its release date to July 31st as questions loom over nationwide reopenings and the status of movie theater attendance at large.Historically, this will be the fourth time the Oscars has been postponed. The award show was first delayed in 1938 following massive flooding in Los Angeles. A second delay occurred in 1968 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and then again in 1981 following an assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan.Alexandra is a Producer & Entertainment Correspondent at Yahoo Finance.
