(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)By targeting advertisers, the groups hope to get Facebook to change how it responds to misinformation and threats, something Twitter has done by taking a stronger hand when it comes to misinformation and threats. The most salient example of this was when President Trump in May, when protests against the killing of George Floyd began across the U.S., posted on Twitter and Facebook: \u201cAny difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d Twitter placed a public interest notice on the tweet for breaking its rules on the \u201cglorification of violence.\u201dIn a statement to various media outlets, Facebook has said that it respects brands' decisions and that it \"remains focused\" on removing hate speech and providing voting information. The company\u2019s COO Sheryl Sandberg also wrote a post on the company\u2019s website announcing commitments to support the Black community, though many of boycotting companies began after the post.On June 26, Facebook announced a few changes: providing info about voting during the pandemic, additional steps to fight voter suppression, a higher standard for hateful content in ads, and the labeling of newsworthy content in ads that may otherwise violate policies.Story continuesSleeping Giants, one of the organizers, has the full running list here.Below are some of the biggest companies that are participating in the boycott so far and their statements.Updated 6/30:PfizerIt\u2019s time to #StopHateForProfit \u2013 learn more about our actions here: https://t.co/mr2pXPrbfa pic.twitter.com/4CbRyfjxau\u2014 Pfizer Inc.
