Economists polled by Bloomberg expect that job openings fell again in May to 4.5 million.The number of U.S. job openings fell in April to 5.1 million, down from 6 million in March, according to the Labor Department\u2019s monthly report. It was the second monthly decline in a row and the lowest level since December 2014.\u201cThe JOLTS report for April showed what you would expect: a collapse in openings and hiring and a surge in layoffs. While some industries like leisure & hospitality unsurprisingly saw large declines in openings, the pain was widespread, as not a single major industry had more job openings in April than there were in February,\u201d Wells Fargo Securities economist Jay Bryson said in a note July 2.It wasn\u2019t good, but it could\u2019ve been worse, according to Bryson. \u201cOpenings \u2018only\u2019 declined to 2014 levels, and based off of the May employment report as well as other economic data, it seems likely that openings and hiring bottomed out in April. If additional data continue to come out in a way that signals April was the bottom in economic activity, this should cement the view that fears of an unemployment rate north of 20% were overblown. The question now shifts to how long of a road it will be back to February levels for job openings, unemployment and other labor market data. A good first sign would be a jump in openings in May for hard hit industries,\u201d Bryson explained.The JOLTS report lags the BLS\u2019s monthly jobs report by one month; however, the it captures data for the entire of the month. Meanwhile, the BLS nonfarm payrolls number measures data through the 12th of the month.SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA - FEBRUARY 13: The Levi's logo is displayed on Levi's 501 jeans on February 13, 2019 in San Francisco, California.
