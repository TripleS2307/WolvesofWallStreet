During a Yahoo Finance interview with Andy Serwer, Navarro commented that Powell has \u201cprobably the worst bedside manner of any Fed chairman in history.\u201dIf he was going to market sushi, Navarro added, he \u201cwould market it as cold dead fish.\u201d Navarro added.Shortly after Navarro\u2019s remarks, President Trump tweeted his own critique of the Federal Reserve.The Federal Reserve is wrong so often. I see the numbers also, and do MUCH better than they do. We will have a very good Third Quarter, a great Fourth Quarter, and one of our best ever years in 2021. We will also soon have a Vaccine & Therapeutics/Cure. That\u2019s my opinion. WATCH!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 11, 2020Larry Kudlow, director of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council, added to the pile-on in a Fox Business interview Thursday. \"I do think Mr. Powell could lighten up a little when he has these press offerings\" he added a joking aside that \"we'll have some media training at some point.\"Like Trump, Navarro, who serves as the director of the White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, has long been critical of the Fed.In 2019, Navarro told Yahoo Finance that the Fed \u201cis playing checkers in a chess world.\u201d However, Navarro\u2019s and Trump\u2019s comments today come off the heels of recent praise for Powell from Trump about the Fed\u2019s response to the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic.White House Trade and Manufacturing Policy Director Peter Navarro at the White House in March. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\u201cI called up Jerome Powell, and I said, \u2018Jerome, you've done a really good job,\u2019\u201d Trump said in March after the Fed took a range of measures to respond to the crisis, adding \u201cI'm very happy with the job he did.\u201dStory continuesThat praise is long gone. Navarro\u2019s perspective is that Powell should not be analyzing or predicting economic trends. He wants that left to the White House.Powell\u2019s best strategy going forward should \"simply be to provide the data and let us know where interest rates are going and keep his mouth shut,\u201d he said.Navarro acknowledged that there are significant challenges ahead, but said if Powell wants to speak on the economy, he should speak with \u201centhusiasm and optimism\u201d as he says the president does.Ben Werschkul is a producer for Yahoo Finance in Washington, DC.Read more:Fed: No rate hikes likely through 2022, projects 6.5% GDP contraction this yearCoronavirus stimulus checks: What would need to happen before a second roundTrump advisor Navarro: 'The Fed is playing checkers in a chess world'Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn,YouTube, and reddit."}]}
