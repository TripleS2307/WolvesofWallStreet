In turn, this anger is manifesting itself into political outcomes, with elections around the world increasingly fought along generational lines.\u201dGetty ImagesThe past decade has been brutal for young adults. The 2008 financial crisis led to a nearly 20% unemployment rate for Americans aged 16-24. While their employment prospects gradually improved, the coronavirus pandemic has wiped away such progress.\u201cThe pandemic sent youth unemployment to its highest levels in over 70 years of recorded data,\u201d Allen wrote. Indeed, the unemployment rate for young Americans was 26.9% in April at the height of the government coronavirus shutdown related layoffs, compared to 14.7% for the general population. While the youth unemployment rate has since dropped to 18.5% in July, it continues to surpass the 10.2% rate for the overall workforce during that same time period.Credit: Deutsche BankMaking matters worse, historical evidence has shown that the effects of recessions are long lasting for young adults as their wages \u201csuffer for years afterwards\u201d and they become far less picky when it comes to accepting job offers,\u201d wrote Allen. They\u2019re \u201cmore likely to accept a lower-paying role than they might have done in a stronger labor market,\u201d according to Deutsche Bank.Story continuesHousing market divideThe wealth divide among younger and older Americans is most pronounced in the housing market. The report explains that the incentives favoring homeowners (mostly older Americans) are often diametrically opposed to the ones that would benefit first-time buyers (often younger people). According to Deutsche Bank, politicians tend to pursue policies that favor higher home values because they think it will lead to increased consumer confidence and will spur spending.Opposition to new housing developments by homeowners can also have the effect of preventing the types of new home construction young people might actually be able to afford, according to the report.\u201cAgeing populations are tilting the balance further against the young. Expensive house prices are continuing to create anger and resentment. And the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 which has disproportionately hurt the young economically \u2013 risks inflaming this resentment further,\u201d Allen wrote.The majority of young adults are left to deal with the social ramifications of being priced out of the housing market, which includes living with their parents and delaying marriage and kids.\u2018Age of Disorder\u2019Deutsche Bank warns of dire consequences for investors and financial markets if this trend continues.\u201cInvestors can expect an abrupt, and significant upheaval in housing and asset markets, tax systems, climate policy, and many other areas,\u201d Allen wrote. \u201cThis scenario becomes more likely towards the end of this decade as Millennial and younger voters start to exceed those in older generations.\u201d (This year millennials have surpassed baby boomers as the country\u2019s largest adult population.)Deutsche Bank points to the rise of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) as indicative of a political trend that could upend the status quo in financial markets.\u201cBernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, was propelled in part by enthusiasm among younger voters towards his left-wing policies, and in both 2016 and 2020 was the runner-up for the Democratic presidential nomination,\u201d wrote Allen.Sanders, for instance, has pushed for the cancelling of all student loan debt and a 60% tax on what he called \u201cobscene wealth gains\u201d during the pandemic.I will be introducing legislation tomorrow to tax the obscene wealth gains billionaires have made during the public health crisis.\u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) August 5, 2020Sanders\u2019 quest to impose higher taxes on the wealthy has sparked criticism by billionaires that such a policy would be punishing success.Deutsche Bank recommends policymakers seek to \u201clevel the playing field\u201d between young adults and their older counterparts to avoid \u201cserious consequences for asset markets,\u201d by, for instance, instituting policies that would impose higher taxes on unearned income or wealth.Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has promised to repeal President Trump\u2019s signature Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in favor of a plan that would increase taxes on Americans earning over $400,000 a year.More from Sibile:How California wildfires are uniting frenemies Trump and NewsomTrump cuts funding for \u2018white privilege\u2019 training as more Republican voters acknowledge systemic racismWe\u2019ll \u2018have a way\u2019 to ban fracking in Biden administration: Sierra ClubJob cuts come for white-collar workers: \u2018There are no truly recession-proof\u2019 occupationsThe Trump payroll tax break you won\u2019t see on your paycheckFind live stock market quotes and the latest business and finance news"}]}
