A final judgment on the constitutionality of the landmark health care law\u2019s \u201cindividual mandate\u201d provision, and potentially the entire law, is expected in the spring of 2021.Supporters of the ACA have said that if the health care bill were to be overturned, it could lead to \u201ctotal chaos\u201d as millions of Americans would lose health insurance coverage and struggle to afford health care.Julie Rosamond discusses a new rule to require \"able-bodied\" Medicaid recipients to work or volunteer for a minimum number of hours each month, or be locked out of health benefits in Lepanto, Arkansas, U.S., May 2, 2018.

If Obamacare is dismantled, as the Trump administration wants and a 2021 Supreme Court decision could entail, then the situation becomes even worse for millions of Americans already struggling with health care bills.\u201cThis is just a persistent problem in the health system right now, and it\u2019s likely to get worse as this economic downturn, the dramatic economic downturn, continues and affects people\u2019s incomes,\" Sara Collins, vice president of the Commonwealth Fund, told Yahoo Finance.Over 40% of adults are underinsured. (Chart: The Commonwealth Fund)Obamacare amid the coronavirus pandemicSince March 1, over 54 million Americans have filed for unemployment and an estimated 27 million people have lost employed-sponsored health care coverage. Many of those unemployed have turned to signing up for COBRA, the ACA marketplace, or Medicaid.\u201cSo if you lose your job right now, your ability to retain some form of health care coverage is going to really depend on whether your state has expanded Medicaid or not,\u201d Jesse Cross-Call, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), told Yahoo Finance.Story continuesThe Medicaid expansion is a key component of Obamacare. Overall, Medicaid \u201cpromotes more comprehensive benefits than private insurance at significantly lower out-of-pocket cost to beneficiaries, but its lower payment rates to health care providers and lower administrative costs make the program very efficient,\u201d according to CBPP.The ACA originally intended for national Medicaid expansion, but the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that the policy was \u201cunduly coercive\u201d and left it up to the states to decide if they wanted to adopt that expansion.Oklahoma and Missouri recently approved ballot measures to expand Medicaid. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)\u201cIt has created this patchwork where Texas is a non-expansion state, but next door in New Mexico, it is an expansion state,\u201d Cross-Call said of the resulting system. \u201cIf you\u2019re a low-income worker with income right below the poverty line, you\u2019re treated differently depending on which state you live in.\u201dOver 73 million people were enrolled in Medicaid for the month of May, an increase from the previous three months, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). And March\u2019s increase, according to CMS, was the first increase in enrollment since March 2017.\u2018There was a need for health care coverage before COVID, but there is even more so now\u2019To be eligible for Medicaid, an individual has to have an annual income that\u2019s below 138% of the federal poverty level; live in a state that adopted the Medicaid expansion; and either be pregnant, elderly, disabled, a parent/caretaker, or a child. The threshold increases depending on the number of people in a household.\u201cMedicaid is a means-tested program,\u201d Robin Rudowitz, vice president for the Kaiser Family Foundation, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cIt\u2019s countercyclical. Just like in previous economic downturns, when individuals lose jobs and incomes, more people become eligible and enroll in the program. Unlike the Great Recession, now the Affordable Care Act is in place. We\u2019ve always seen Medicaid enrollment rise during economic downturns, but now, we\u2019re also always seeing a lot of people who become uninsured.\u201dAnd while Medicaid is crucial to providing coverage for the more vulnerable populations like the elderly and disabled, it\u2019s also a major source of health care coverage for essential and front-line workers throughout this pandemic.The NYC Department of Sanitation works during the coronavirus pandemic on April 14, 2020 in New York City. (Photo by Noam Galai/Getty Images)\u201cThere was a need for health care coverage before COVID, but there is even more so now,\u201d Cross-Call said. \u201cThese are working individuals. There\u2019s a large number of them who work in what are considered at this point to be essential or front line industries. These are folks who are home health aides or who work in a grocery store. Basically, they don\u2019t have the luxury of working from home and they\u2019re in settings where they\u2019re likely to be exposed to the coronavirus.\u201dAt least 5 million essential workers \u2014 including those who work in health care, food production, grocery stores, and transportation/waste management \u2014 are enrolled in Medicaid, according to a CBPP analysis. The study also estimated that an additional 650,000 essential workers who are uninsured would be eligible for Medicaid if their states adopted the expansion.\u201cThe states that haven\u2019t implemented at this point, by and large, are conservative states,\u201d Cross-Call said. \u201cThere does seem to be some ideological component about government health care in there. But this cost issue has been persistent.\u201dFurthermore, according to research from the Kaiser Family Foundation, if the remaining non-expansion states were to finally adopt the expansion, \u201can estimated 2.8 million adults who were uninsured in 2020 would move out of the coverage gap by 2021 and instead have access to Medicaid coverage.\u201dDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden delivers remarks after meeting with Pennsylvania families who have benefited from the Affordable Care Act on June 25, 2020 in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. (Photo: JIM WATSON / AFP)The cost issueMedicaid is a costly program, accounting for 16% of total national health expenditures in 2018 at $597.4 billion.\u201cThere have been some consistent arguments that opponents have made through the years,\u201d Cross-Call said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been worrying about uncertainty about what it would cost the state to do it because for the first few years, the federal government paid the entire cost of the expansion. Now they\u2019re paying 90%, so the state has to pick up 10% of the cost, and that\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to be every year going forward.\u201dThe cost of Medicaid for both the federal and state governments has been a controversial topic over the years. In a paper for Mercatus Center, researchers Brian Blase and Aaron Yelowitz found that some states were improperly enrolling people in their Medicaid programs.\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to speculate on motives,\u201d Yelowitz, a professor of economics at the University of Kentucky, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWhat we can say for sure is that both from a view at 10,000 feet or at the ground level, there appear to be many people who are enrolled in Medicaid \u2014 pre-pandemic is what we were studying \u2014 who have incomes that make them ineligible for the program.\u201dJenny Beth Martin, Rep.

Ferrell/Congressional Quarterly/Getty Images)The research found that adults mainly between the ages of 19 to 64 weren\u2019t having their incomes properly verified.\u201cThings like how quickly we verify your income and when your income goes up, which in good times people get pay raises and find jobs and so forth,\u201d Yelowitz said. \u201cThen basically, you\u2019re supposed to be removed from the program within a certain period of time and that doesn\u2019t seem to be happening as much as it should.\u201dAnother \u201cstructural weakness\u201d that Yelowitz encountered in his research that some people were stating that their family size was larger than it actually was in order to qualify for Medicaid.\u201cYou might wonder: Is this a big deal or a small deal?\u201d Yelowitz said. \u201cYou\u2019d imagine if you had 50 different states determining eligibility for literally the same person with the same \u2018rules,\u2019 you might come up with different outcomes, but it wouldn\u2019t be too much different if you took a group of 100 people. But what you do see if in reality that the audit reports really do say a fair number of people don\u2019t seem to be eligible for the program at all.\u201dAdriana is a reporter and editor covering politics and health care policy for Yahoo Finance.
