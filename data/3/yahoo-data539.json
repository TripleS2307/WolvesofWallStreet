As the coronavirus crisis gained a foothold in the world\u2019s largest economy back in March, yields \u2014 which move inversely to prices \u2014 surged as investors priced in a looming financial disaster.However, the Fed\u2019s crisis policy, which includes zero interest rates and purchases of exchange-traded funds and corporate debt, has bolstered the sector and sparked at least $1 trillion more in fresh issuance last month. The central bank\u2019s ultra-loose policy has been credited with helping to fuel Wall Street\u2019s rally, which until this week seemed unstoppable.\u201cIt\u2019s very clear to me given where we are on the growth/inflation outlook the Fed will keep pushing policy in a dovish direction and rising asset markets won\u2019t deter them at all,\u201d said Eric Stein, co-director of global income for Eaton Vance Management.It\u2019s also raised growing concerns about the prospect for so-called \u201czombie companies\u201d haunting markets indefinitely, when some might be better off going under.\u201cAllowing zombie companies to linger might be why long term growth suffers as a consequence of a severe financial crisis and recession,\u201d BNY Mellon Asset Management chief economist Vincent Reinhart told Yahoo Finance\u2019s On The Move on Thursday.File-This July 31, 2019 file photo shows the Federal Reserve Building in Washington.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File)\u2018Speculative fever\u2019The risks are multiplying, as major companies in some of the hardest-hit sectors of the COVID-19 crisis have used favorable market conditions to tap debt markets in offerings worth billions of dollars \u2014 including Marriott (MAR), Carnival (CCL), Delta (DAL) and Avis (CAR). In May, Boeing (BA), sandbagged by the coronavirus and an ongoing crisis with its flagship 737 MAX, was still able to raise $25 billion in a blockbuster debt sale.Story continuesAccording to Fitch Ratings, U.S. non-financials flooded the market with a record $584 billion of investment-grade debt alone last month \u2014more than twice the amount from the comparable year-ago period.The market is set to eclipse the previous record high of $644 billion in 2017, Fitch noted, with the value of all investment grade bonds now over $4.4 trillion.It\u2019s part of what Kathy Jones, Charles Schwab\u2019s chief fixed income strategist called a \u201cspeculative fever\u201d feeding the market\u2019s appetite for debt, and companies\u2019 desire to issue it.While bonds\u2019 yields have recovered from the blow out earlier this year, \u201cnot that much has changed for a lot of these companies that find themselves with a certain amount of stress,\u201d Jones told Yahoo Finance.\u201cInterest rates are lower so that may help them roll over some loans but clearly the economy is in a deep recession and a lot of people have rushed in...and its lifted all boats,\u201d she added.That\u2019s bad news given that some marginal companies are less productive than their peers, and keeping them afloat has spillover economic effects, according to Torsten Slok, Deutsche Bank\u2019s chief economist.\u201cOne consequence of aggressive Fed support to credit markets and long periods of low interest rates is that it interferes with the process of creative destruction and keeps companies alive that would otherwise have gone out of business,\u201d Slok wrote in a client research note this week.\u201cThis is a macroeconomic problem because zombie firms are less productive, and their existence lowers investment in and employment at more productive firms,\u201d he added.\u201cIn short, one side effect of central banks keeping rates low for a long time is that it keeps more unproductive firms alive, which ultimately lowers the long-run growth rate of the economy,\u201d Slok wrote.According to data from Goldman Sachs, corporate bonds have retraced over 90% of the spread widening from the beginning of 2020 to the March 23 peak, with investment grade and junk issuance up 90% and 57% year-over-year, respectively.That may not be a problem if a V-shaped recovery emerges. However, new COVID-19 infections have spooked markets, and thrown rosier scenarios into doubt.Both quality and high yield issuers \u201chave responded to the crisis by increasing gross leverage, which has allowed them to strengthen their liquidity positions. But should the economic recovery disappoint, the recent increase in gross leverage could become permanent, or worse, translate into higher net leverage as earnings continue to contract,\u201d Goldman added.Javier David is an editor for Yahoo Finance.
