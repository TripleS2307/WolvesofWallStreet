Despite that, Randolph says it won\u2019t be enough to entice Netflix to do the same, nor will it be enough to shake things up.\u201cIf they had been first or second they may have designed a slightly different product,\u201d he said in a new interview with Yahoo Finance\u2019s YFi PM. \u201cWhen you\u2019re the tenth guy in, you have to shake up the playbook, and certainly [the COVID-19 pandemic] has not helped their situation.\u201dAs Randolph knows well from his days building out Netflix when it was still shipping DVDs, sometimes launches don\u2019t necessarily go according to plan. Despite more Americans streaming content in the stay-at-home environment sparked by the pandemic, Peacock is not launching with the content it had hoped for. Mainly, NBC\u2019s parent company Comcast has struggled through the Tokyo Olympics getting postponed due to the pandemic, which limited the firepower of exclusive offerings that were supposed to fuel the intrigue of the media giant\u2019s streaming platform.Netflix co-founder Marc Randolph now spends most of his time coaching early stage startups and founders.

Next year it will pull back \u201cThe Office\u201d from Netflix, which has been one of the platform\u2019s most streamed series. Beyond that, there\u2019s always the allure of packaging sports content, something other streaming options don\u2019t have.Story continuesParaphrasing former U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, Randolph classified Peacock\u2019s launch as a perfect example of a streaming service entering the streaming wars with the features it has, not the features it wanted.\u201cThey don\u2019t have mobile downloads, they don\u2019t have 4K [steaming quality] but they are going to have these things. I think it\u2019s going to take a while,\u201d Randolph said. \u201cI think it\u2019s not going to be until next year that we see Peacock coming into its own. I think it\u2019s starting off with its wings a little bit clipped.\u201dZack Guzman is the host of YFi PM as well as a senior writer and on-air reporter covering entrepreneurship, cannabis, startups, and breaking news at Yahoo Finance.
