The reason I say that is that we need the time to see if the vaccine actually works and we need to see if it\u2019s safe.\u201dDr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), stressed that rushing a vaccine could do more harm than good.\u201cThe one thing that you would not want to see with a vaccine is getting an [emergency use authorization] before you have a signal of efficacy,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cOne of the potential dangers if you prematurely let a vaccine out is that it would make it difficult, if not impossible, for the other vaccines to enroll people in their trial.\u201dPresident Trump, meanwhile, has tweeted that the FDA should \u201cfocus on speed\u201d while telegraphing his desire that a coronavirus vaccine be ready by Election Day, November 3.\u2018Keep a firewall between science and politics\u2019Experts have repeatedly refuted the idea that a safe, vetted vaccine could be ready as quickly as the president would like.\u201cWhat we don\u2019t want to do is rush things along so fast for obviously political reasons, as far as I can tell, to get it out there and then discover \u2018wait, this vaccine doesn\u2019t work like we thought it was going to work\u2019 or worse, there are safety issues,\u201d Saag said. \u201cSo Fauci is exactly right. We need to do this the right way and keep a firewall between science and politics.\u201dPresident Donald Trump looks on as FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn addresses the media during a press conference at the White Houseon August 23, 2020 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Pete Marovich/Getty Images)This isn\u2019t the first time that health officials warned about the Trump administration\u2019s influence on public health organizations.Last weekend, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorization (EUA) for convalescent plasma as a means for treating COVID-19 after Trump insinuated that the FDA was slow-walking clinical trials as part of a \u201cdeep state\u201d plot to hinder his chances at re-election.Story continuesIn a lengthy Twitter thread, FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said that the decision to issue an EUA was based solely on science. A few days later, the CDC created widespread alarm and confusion when the public health agency changed guidelines on coronavirus testing after pressure from administration officials.\u201cWe can\u2019t really have politics interfering with what science needs to do,\u201d Saag said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to work well. And it\u2019s going to endanger all of us if we keep letting this bleeding happen from the political space into the science space. So let\u2019s let everyone do their job and try to keep politics out of it.\u201dAdriana is a reporter and editor covering politics and health care policy for Yahoo Finance.
