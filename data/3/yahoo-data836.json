On Friday, most of them saw a surge in their shares. Apple and Facebook rose to records with the iPhone maker\u2019s market valuation briefly surpassing Saudi Arabian Oil Co. Amazon gained as much as 6.4%. Only Google bucked the trend, sliding 4.3%.Apple executives were quick to recognize how their strong results contrasted with an economic collapse that has caused millions of job losses, hundreds of thousands of deaths and many bankruptcies.Earlier Thursday, U.S. government officials reported that gross domestic product contracted by the most on record -- 32.9% on an annualized basis -- and 17 million Americans claimed state unemployment benefits in mid-July.\u201cWe\u2019re conscious of the fact that these results stand in stark relief during a time of real economic adversity for businesses, large and small, and certainly for families,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said on a conference call. \u201cWe do not have a zero-sum approach to prosperity, and especially in times like this, we are focused on growing the pie, making sure our success isn\u2019t just our success.\u201dStory continuesCook cut back on his usual litany of praise for his company\u2019s quarterly performance and instead devoted much of his scripted time on the call to discussing things like a contact-tracing partnership with Google, the deployment of masks, and the design of a face shield for medical workers.The numbers paint a clear picture, though. IPad and Mac sales surged on demand from people working and studying from home. The Mac had its second strongest quarter ever, while the iPad had its best June quarter in eight years, Cook noted in an interview with Bloomberg TV.Amazon posted a record quarterly profit as people avoiding physical stores shopped online. Unit sales at the largest online retailer surged 57%, the fastest pace of growth since the company began breaking out that metric.\u201cThe penetration of e-commerce is accelerating,\u201d said Hari Srinivasan, a senior analyst with Neuberger Berman. Amazon a prime beneficiary of the shift, and \u201cthe changes are here to stay,\u201d he added.Amazon executives, in the earnings release and on conference calls with analysts and the media, didn\u2019t go out of their way to tout the company\u2019s record sales and profit. Instead, they highlighted the company\u2019s hiring during the pandemic, as well as investments in employee safety.A day after testifying to Congress about Amazon\u2019s sometimes harsh treatment of small merchants, CEO Jeff Bezos noted in a statement that such sellers saw faster growth than Amazon\u2019s own retail operation.Facebook reported better-than-expected results partly because so many small and medium-sized businesses are moving online right now to survive, Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said.\u201cA lot of businesses are struggling, but at the same time businesses have to pivot online,\u201d she added. \u201cWe become a place you can set up a website, set up a digital storefront.\u201dThe company reported that it has more than 9 million advertisers, and over 180 million small businesses that use the free parts of its service, such as a Facebook or Instagram profile.CEO Mark Zuckerberg picked up where he left off at Wednesday\u2019s antitrust hearing, referring to the tech industry as an \u201dAmerican success story.\u201d But he also took aim at President Donald Trump for the second time this month.\u201cIt is incredibly disappointing because it seems like the U.S. could have avoided this current surge in cases if our government had handled this better,\u201d Zuckerberg said.Alphabet\u2019s Google was the only big tech company to report a notable impact from the pandemic on Thursday. Revenue fell for the first time as advertisers spent less. The company is heavily exposed to the travel and retail industries, which have been particularly hard hit by the crisis.Still, other parts of Google\u2019s business performed well. Sales at Google\u2019s cloud business jumped 43%, while YouTube ad revenue rose 6% as more people watched online videos at home.CEO Sundar Pichai played down concern about a regulatory crackdown on Google, which is facing an imminent antitrust case from the Justice Department.\u201cWe\u2019ve obviously been operating under scrutiny for a while,\u201d he said. \u201cWe realize, at our scale, that\u2019s appropriate.\u201d(Updates with shares in fifth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."}]}
