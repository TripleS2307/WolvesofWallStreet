George said that until the economy has shown signs that it has \u201cregained its footing,\u201d the Fed will keep its level of support.\u201cWe have done a lot,\u201d George said on the sidelines of the Jackson Hole symposium, an annual meeting of monetary policymakers from around the world that has shifted to a virtual format due to the virus.The Kansas City Fed covers all of five states (Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Wyoming) and part of two states (New Mexico and Missouri). In that region, George said coronavirus cases were initially low but noted \u201cvariation\u201d in counts over the summer.For example, Colorado reported yesterday the lowest three-day moving average positivity rate since the outbreak began. But case counts in Kansas continue to rise, with the state now reporting at least one positive case in each of the state\u2019s 105 counties.George said if economic conditions worsen, the central bank may still have some tricks up its sleeve.\u201cIf the economy takes a turn, the committee is going to have to think about what, if anything, it should be doing. And I wouldn't suggest that we won't do anything,\u201d George said.[Kansas City Fed President Esther George speaks with Yahoo Finance: Transcript]Esther George, president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, speaks with a colleague during the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium at the Jackson Lake Lodge in Grand Teton National Park near Jackson, Wyo., Friday, Aug. 22, 2014.

When the coronavirus began wreaking havoc on markets in early March, she delivered a speech warning that large-scale asset purchases and prolonged periods of low interest rates \u201ccan lead to a buildup of financial imbalances that ultimately pose risks to the real economy.\u201dSince that speech, the Fed has ballooned its balance sheet to $7 trillion and involved itself with actively backstopping corporate debt markets.\u201cThat is always a concern, and I suspect will be something we are going to have to focus on in the years ahead,\u201d George told Yahoo Finance.George said that despite those concerns, she has supported the central bank\u2019s COVID rsponse in light of the fact that \u201cthe economy is suffering a terrible shock right now.\u201dThe Jackson Hole symposium will take place August 27-28 and, for the first time, be live-streamed for anyone to watch.The FOMC\u2019s next policy-setting meeting is scheduled for September 15-16.Brian Cheung is a reporter covering the Fed, economics, and banking for Yahoo Finance.
