The analyst maintains a Neutral rating on the stock.\u201cBuilding capacity in the automotive industry is expensive and often generates low returns,\u201d said Murphy. \u201cEven if there is a future software/service/ride-hail play for TSLA (and we have our doubts), the vehicles/platform still need to be manufactured,\u201d he said.\u201cIt is important to recognize that the higher the upward spiral of TSLA's stock goes, the cheaper capital becomes to fund growth, which is then rewarded by investors with a higher stock price,\u201d he wrote.Year-to-date the stock is currently up around 425%. Shares rallied 12% on Monday following a 5-for-1 stock split.BERLIN, GERMANY - SEPTEMBER 02: Tesla head Elon Musk (Photo by Maja Hitij/Getty Images)\u2018No need for internal funding when external is plentiful\u2019Murphy says Tesla does not need internal funding \u201cwhen external is plentiful.\u201dHe points to government subsidies for consumers and low cost loans which helped Tesla in its initial phase of development. He also highlights regulatory credits that have amounted to more than $1 billion in the last 12 months. Lastly, Murphy says, \u201cResults and momentum are further stimulating low-cost equity funding as the stock rises.\u201d\u201cSimply put, TSLA is a new disruptive (auto) company that may or may not be dominant in the long-term, but that does not matter as long as it can keep funding outsized growth with almost no cost capital driving capacity expansion,\u201d he wrote.Tesla\u2019s latest 2nd quarter results announced in July beat expectations. The company posted a fourth consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability making the stock eligible to be considered for inclusion in to the S&P 500 (^GSPC). That has also helped the stock rally over the last month.Story continuesAnalysts have been racing to re-rate the stock this year.
