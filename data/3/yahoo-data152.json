Are we prepared to deal with that? And the answer is probably not.\u201dLisa Kaplan, founder of Aletha Group, was the digital director of Sen. Angus King\u2019s (I-ME) 2018 reelection campaign and developed the campaign\u2019s strategy for fighting disinformation.\u201cMy hope is that organizations are starting to ask themselves, \u2018What would we do if and when this happens to us?\u2019,\u201d said Kaplan in an interview with Yahoo Finance.While experts are hopeful this latest hack will motivate campaigns to further prepare, they note this isn\u2019t a new threat.\u201cWe've seen so many wake-up calls. Hopefully it'll be a wake-up call for the campaigns cause they are targets and they know they\u2019re targets,\u201d said Lewis. \u201cWhatever their strategy is now, they need to take a step back and ask how they make it stronger.\u201dKaplan and Lewis told Yahoo Finance Wednesday night\u2019s Twitter hack reminded them of the 2013 hack on the Associated Press that briefly moved financial markets.\u201cIt is a huge risk,\u201d said Kaplan. \u201cCampaigns need to take a very proactive approach to this \u2014 and everybody needs to have a plan for what they're going to do if and when it happens to them.\u201dScreenshot of former President Barack Obama's Twitter account during a Twitter hack on Wednesday evening.Prepare for \u2018every possible risk\u2019Mick Baccio, a security analyst at Splunk who used to run cybersecurity for former Mayor Pete Buttigieg\u2019s presidential campaign, said there is only so much campaigns can do if the social media companies themselves are targeted \u2014 but campaigns need to be prepared.Story continues\u201cGenerally when you see something in large scale like that, you look at, \u2018Hey, this is not us. This is Twitter,\u2019 and that's when all of your tabletops come into play,\u201d said Baccio in an interview with Yahoo Finance. \u201cIf X happens, what do you do? Just every possible risk or scenario that you can think of, you kind of game plan.\u201dBaccio said it\u2019s important for campaigns to have contacts at social media companies and know what steps they\u2019ll take if the companies or their accounts are compromised.\u201cThose private sector, public sector partnerships are critical just for the integrity of the election,\u201d said Baccio.Lewis said campaigns should also work with the companies to get an \u201cextra layer of protection\u201d on their accounts. Kaplan urged political campaigns to prepare for the worst, by doing more than monitoring mainstream social media platforms.\u201cBy the time it's already trending on Twitter [or Facebook], you're on the backfoot,\u201d said Kaplan. \u201cStart doing real threat investigations to understand what's happening and be able to get those advanced warning signs that a group may be organizing in the more fringe platforms on the internet.\u201dBaccio told Yahoo Finance he\u2019d like to see additional legislation or a federal agency created to deal with campaign cybersecurity.Lawmakers want answersMembers of Congress are pushing for answers about the hack. Rep. John Garamendi (D-CA) tweeted he has \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about the safety of elections after the incident.\u201cNow more than ever we have to strengthen our nation\u2019s cyber security,\u201d tweeted Garamendi.I don\u2019t have any bitcoin to offer you but I do have grave concerns about what today\u2019s hack of @Twitter means for the safety of our elections and other critical infrastructure from hostile actors. Now more than ever we have to strengthen our nation\u2019s cyber security.\u2014 John Garamendi (@RepGaramendi) July 15, 2020The top Republican on the House Oversight Committee, Rep. James Comer, requested information from Twitter on Thursday \u2014 and asked for a briefing about the hack no later than July 24. Comer wants to know about the origin of the attack, what Twitter is doing to prevent another similar incident and what additional training Twitter employees will have to do going forward.Comer said security breaches on social media could \u201cjeopardize our national security and disrupt the lives of millions of Americans.\u201dThe hack happened hours after a House Oversight Committee hearing on cybersecurity preparedness. The Chairwoman of the committee, Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) tweeted that the incident shows the need for the U.S. to streamline the government response to cyber attacks.Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) sent a letter to Twitter (TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey early Wednesday evening as the hack was unfolding, urging him to work with the FBI and the Department of Justice to secure the site. Among other questions, Hawley wanted to know if the attack threatened President Trump\u2019s account.\u201cThe accounts targeted include those for Apple, Uber, Jeff Bezos, former President Barack Obama, and even the Democratic nominee for President. The list of affected accounts is growing by the minute. Some affected accounts are alleged to have been protected by Twitter\u2019s two factor authentication,\u201d said Hawley in the letter. \u201cI am concerned that this event may represent not merely a coordinated set of separate hacking incidents but rather a successful attack on the security of Twitter itself.\u201dJessica Smith is a reporter for Yahoo Finance based in Washington, D.C.
