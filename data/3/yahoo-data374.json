An index tracking employment rose to 49.6, staying in modestly contractionary territory just below the neutral level of 50.\u201cThe bigger picture here is that the manufacturing rebound continues, though it seems no longer to be accelerating,\u201d Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in an email Thursday. \u201cThe ISM and other surveys are consistent with further decent increases in orders and output over the next few months and, at the current rate of increase, output will be back to the pre-Covid level around the time of the anniversary of the initial plunge in activity next March.\u201d\u20149:32 a.m. ET: Stocks open higher after jobless claims improve more than expectedHere were the main moves in markets as of 4:03 p.m. ET:S&P 500 (^GSPC): +25.28 points (+0.75%) to 3,388.28Dow (^DJI): +190.36 points (+0.69%) to 27,972.06Nasdaq (^IXIC): +131.96 (+1.2%) to 11,298.49Crude (CL=F): -$1.20 (-2.98%) to $39.02 a barrelGold (GC=F): +$12.40 (+0.65%) to $1,907.90 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): +3.7 bps to yield 0.714%\u20148:32 a.m. ET: Personal income falls more than expected in August, though spending holds upUS personal income fell more than expected in August, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported Thursday morning, in the agency\u2019s first report after federal enhanced unemployment benefits expired at the end of July.Personal income fell 2.7% month over month, versus a 2.5% decline expected.
