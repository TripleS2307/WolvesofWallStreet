REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/PoolThe Fed\u2019s program has extended only $2 billion in loans, of the $600 billion that the central bank says it has the capacity for. Critics have argued that the $250,000 minimum loan amount, in addition to EBITDA-based eligibility tests, make the loans inaccessible for small businesses.Democrats and Republicans on the House Financial Services Committee pressed Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on the idea of expanding the scope of its Main Street program. Mnuchin said he would support lowering the minimum loan size to $100,000, but Powell immediately added that smaller businesses broadly do not appear interested in the Fed program.But small businesses are still looking for help, creating pressure on the Fed and Congress to act quickly.

Less than half of those funds have been used so far, to stand up programs to backstop markets ranging from corporate credit to municipal bonds.Story continues\u201cI unfortunately think there\u2019s not more we can do,\u201d Mnuchin said of the unused funds.Mnuchin added that he would support reallocating $200 billion of the money originally earmarked for other purposes, a change that would require Congressional action. In addition to a new round of stimulus checks, Mnuchin said President Donald Trump would \u201cvery much support\u201d additional PPP money.But not all lawmakers were warm to the idea of replenishing the PPP. Kentucky Republican Andy Barr argued that the PPP did not help small businesses looking for smaller loans \u201cbecause their payroll is fairly limited and they have larger amounts of debt.\u201dPPP loans were forgivable, but only if workers were retained and at least 60% of the loan was used for payroll. The Main Street loans from the Fed are not forgivable due to the central bank\u2019s limitation on offering only loans, not grants.Powell and his colleagues at the Fed have highlighted on several occasions that the Fed\u2019s limitations increase the onus on Congress to take action.But Congress does not appear close to a deal on a new fiscal package. A Democratic-led House and Republican-led Senate were not able to stop the expiration of extra unemployment insurance benefits, with no clear timeline on a compromise ahead of the November election.The top Republican on the House Financial Services Committee, North Carolina\u2019s Patrick McHenry, applauded the Fed for its actions in a time when Congress \u201ccan\u2019t get its act together.\u201d\u201cI would give the Federal Reserve an A+ for its initial response and to where we are,\u201d said McHenry.Brian Cheung is a reporter covering the Fed, economics, and banking for Yahoo Finance.
