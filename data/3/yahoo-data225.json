The figures should add to the urgency being heaped on Congress and the White House to enact a new stimulus bill ahead of Election Day, but talks have largely stagnated in recent weeks.Overnight, the world was rocked by the revelation that the president and First Lady Melania Trump, who also tested positive for Covid-19, would begin the \u201cquarantine and recovery process immediately.\u201d The White House has canceled all of Trump\u2019s previously scheduled public events, which included a rally in Florida on Friday.The three major indices sold off on the news, but pared some losses as the session rolled on, after White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said Trump was experiencing just \u201cmild symptoms.\u201d The Dow fell by as many as 434 points, or 1.6%, at session lows Friday morning. The Nasdaq lagged as tech stocks gave back Thursday\u2019s advances.The risk-off mood broadened out into other asset classes as well, with crude oil prices extending Thursday\u2019s drop to plunge another 4%.\u201cMarkets (being impersonal) will focus on whether this affects the election outcome or public health policy,\u201d UBS economist Paul Donovan said in a note Friday. \u201cThe future presidential debates may not happen; these were not seen as especially significant. Those opposed to mask-wearing may revise their views, and the president's experience may impact US public health policy.\u201dOther members of the Trump administration reported negative tests for Covid-19. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Vice President Mike Pence each tested negative for the coronavirus, according to their respective spokespeople.Story continuesThe moves in equity markets were a sharp contrast to the strong advances during Thursday\u2019s regular session, when a tech-led advance powered the Nasdaq higher by 1.4%. Gains in the S&P 500 and Dow, however, had been much more muted. The two indices lost steam in afternoon trading, after discussions between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday apparently yielded no agreement on a virus-related relief proposal. Republican and Democratic lawmakers remain far apart on the dollar amount of another round of stimulus, as well as on details on sums for state and local aid.House Democrats, however, still on Thursday evening voted to advance their $2.2 trillion stimulus proposal unveiled earlier this week. However, the package is almost certain to be struck down by Senate Republican lawmakers, who have balked at the high price tag of the proposal.\u20144:01 p.m. ET: Stocks end lower as tech stocks slide, after Trump tests positive for Covid-19Here\u2019s where the three major indices settled at the end of Friday\u2019s session:S&P 500 (^GSPC): -33.07 points (-0.98%) to 3,347.73Dow (^DJI): -133.49 points (-0.48%) to 27,683.41Nasdaq (^IXIC): -251.49 points (-2.22%) to 11,075.02\u20141:02 p.m. ET: Dow turns positive as markets cut losses furtherThe three major indices pared more losses Friday afternoon and the Dow popped into slightly positive territory.Here were the main moves in markets, as of 1:03 p.m. ET:S&P 500 (^GSPC): -16.19 points (-0.48%) to 3,364.61Dow (^DJI): +1.86 points (+0.01%) to 27,818.76Nasdaq (^IXIC): -196.45 points (-1.73%) to 11,130.75Crude (CL=F): -$1.18 (-3.05%) to $37.54 a barrelGold (GC=F): -$3.30 (-0.17%) to $1,913.00 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): +2.4 bps to yield 0.701%\u201411:07 a.m. ET: Stocks cut losses, Dow sheds 100+ pointsThe three major indices held lower in intraday trading, but came off session lows after Trump\u2019s Covid-19 symptoms were reported as \u201cmild\u201d and other members of his administration reported negative test results.The S&P 500 fell 0.8% shortly after 11 a.m. ET, with the utilities, materials and industrials sectors in the green.

MichiganThe University of Michigan\u2019s final September consumer sentiment index increased more than expected, reflecting a pick-up in consumers\u2019 assessments of current conditions and outlook for the economy, according to a statement Friday.The index ticked up to a six-month high of 80.4 in the final September print from 74.1 in August. The preliminary September print had been at 78.9.\u201cWhile consumers have anticipated gains in the national economy ever since the April shutdown, the September survey recorded a significant increase in the proportion that expected a reestablishment of good times financially in the overall economy,\u201d Richard Curtin, Surveys of Consumers chief economist, said in a statement.\u201cThe recent gains are encouraging even though they were largely due to upper income households. Indeed, the data indicate that lower income households face continued income and job losses compared with the modest gains expected by upper income households,\u201d he added. \u201cWithout a renewed federal stimulus and enhanced unemployment payments, the income gap will widen.\u201d\u201410:00 a.m. ET: Factory orders rise less than expected in August as manufacturing activity slowsUS factory orders rose 0.7% in August, the Commerce Department said Friday, marking a slowdown from July\u2019s upwardly revised 6.5% gain.

Meanwhile, August\u2019s figures were revised up slightly to nearly 1.5 million (versus 1.37 million prior).All told, September\u2019s figures cement the belief that the recovery is losing steam, and adds to Wall Street\u2019s gloom in the wake of Trump contracting COVID-19. Futures are down more than 1%, pointing to a rough day when the opening bell rings at the NYSE.\u20148:20 a.m. ET: Tesla delivers record number of vehicles in Q3Tesla (TSLA) reported third-quarter deliveries of 139,300 for a record single-quarter sum and jump of 44% year-over-year.
