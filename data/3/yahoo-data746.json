Organizations like the World Health Organization and companies like Moderna (MRNA) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) are vying to be the first to develop a way to curb the spread of COVID-19.It\u2019s a process that is expected to require many months of testing and trials, but if successful (which is far from certain) the next hurdle will be to ensure that factories and labs can produce the millions of doses needed.As the National Defense Production Act policy coordinator, one of Peter Navarro\u2019s jobs at the White House will be to make that happen.Peter Navarro with President Trump at the White House in March. (Pete Marovich-Pool/Getty Images)During a Yahoo Finance Presents interview with Andy Serwer, Navarro promised, \u201cWe won't be in a situation where we have too little.\u201dHe pointed to companies like Puritan Medical Products, which the President Trump and Navarro visited last week, and General Dynamics (GD) as examples of the industry mobilizing to ramp up production within a matter of weeks.Will a vaccine be shared?A key question is what happens if a virus is produced overseas, perhaps by the World Health Organization, with which the Trump administration recently cut ties.Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, discussed this question recently with Yahoo Finance. talked to Yahoo Finance on Tuesday about this question.\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to have a situation with one country or one organization that they are or are not going to share,\u201d he said, based on his hope that enough organizations around the world will develop a vaccine with \u2018favorable responses.\u2019Navarro echoed Fauci\u2019s point Thursday noting that the U.S. is already pushing forward on smaller manufacturing contracts so \u201cif, in fact, one of the five or six vaccine developers comes up with what we need, we will have already been able to produce that.\u201dLast week, as an example, the Department of Defense announced it had contracted with another frontrunner, Novavax (NVAX), to produce 10 million doses of its still unproven vaccine candidate for military use.Story continuesNavarro, who also serves as the director of the White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, added that \u201cthe worst thing that can happen if the vaccine doesn't work is we'll have too much capacity to produce it,\u201d adding \u201cthat's where we're heading.\u201d\u2018I don't even know how you work with China on a vaccine\u2019China has its own vaccine effort underway. CanSino, which is is supported by the Chinese government, says it could have a vaccine approved by the fall, matching the most aggressive timelines of companies in the U.S.China is \u201ctreating this like a military operation,\u201d a Biotech investor told Yahoo Finance of China\u2019s effort.Earlier this week, Navarro published an op-ed saying he has no interest in working with China on a vaccine. China has been using the coronavirus crisis to \u201cadvance its strategic interests,\u201d he said, and \u201clies through its teeth.\u201d\u201cI don't even know how you work with China on a vaccine,\u201d he said.All over the World the CoronaVirus, a very bad \u201cgift\u201d from China, marches on. Not good!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 28, 2020\u2018Trump time\u2019Fauci says that he expects some of the vaccine candidates in the U.S. to enter Phase 3 trials as soon as July, with the possibility of a viable vaccine by the end of the year.Navarro didn\u2019t comment directly on timing but is confident that the manufacturing process would be swift, citing the recent turnaround of ventilators and medical swabs.Ever the showman like his boss, he said the U.S. would move \u201cin what I call Trump time.\u201dBen Werschkul is a producer for Yahoo Finance in Washington, D.C.Read more:Fauci: Sped-up production on coronavirus vaccine risky and costly \u2014 but worth itTop Trump adviser: Jerome Powell should provide the data and then \u2018keep his mouth shut\u2019\u2018I actually would be tougher\u2019: A Democrat's plan for changing the relationship with China after TrumpRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn,YouTube, and reddit."}]}
