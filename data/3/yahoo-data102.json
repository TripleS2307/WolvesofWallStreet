However, the stadium is still allowing socially distanced tailgates and only \u201cencouraging\u201d masks for those events before the game. Arrowhead is also going cashless to limit interactions between fans and staff during transactions.Fans wearing face masks watch the Kansas City Chiefs during an NFL football training camp Saturday, Aug. 22, 2020, at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Mo.
