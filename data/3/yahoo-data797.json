(Graeme Jennings/Pool via AP)Cook, however, pushed back, saying that Apple does not favor any apps and that the company applies its rules evenly across the App Store.Representatives Lucy McBath (D-GA) and Val Butler Demings (D-FL) similarly questioned Apple\u2019s App Store policies, specifically pointing to Apple\u2019s controversial move to remove parental control apps in 2019. According to The New York Times, Apple reinstated some of the apps shortly after reports were published about antitrust investigations into Silicon Valley tech giants and following the company\u2019s release of its own parental control apps.Apple, meanwhile, said it banned the apps because they were using something called Mobile Device Management, and could have been able to sell data collected using those apps to third parties. However, the Times\u2019 report said that Apple was unable to prove any of the previously banned apps had taken such steps.Story continuesApple\u2019s App Store commission and its control over apps that can appear in the store are some of the main issues behind the antitrust investigations into the company by the Department of Justice and several state attorneys general.Apple requires apps to meet specific guidelines for them to be listed in the App Store, as well as use Apple\u2019s App Store payment system. App developers that sell through the App Store pay a 30% commission to Apple. Subscriptions purchased through the store require a 30% commission for the first year and 15% for each subsequent year.That move, according to app developers like Spotify (SPOT), is unfair since Apple itself offers a competing service in Apple Music and doesn\u2019t have to pay a commission for its sales.Apple does allow so-called \u201creader\u201d apps like Spotify or Netflix (NFLX) to avoid paying commissions for subscriptions, because they don\u2019t let users sign up through the apps themselves. Apps like Spotify and Netflix can\u2019t list any call to action telling users where they can sign up for their services.Cook made sure to point out that Apple\u2019s App Store commissions are commensurate with those required by competitors like Google through its Google Play app store, but Apple also operates its operating system as a walled garden.No apps can be installed on an iPhone if they aren\u2019t available through the App Store. Apple says that\u2019s to ensure security and quality. Google, however, allows users to install apps from outside of its Play Store, though it\u2019s not something the average user would likely know how to do and requires allowing the installation of apps from third-party sources.The one instance in which Cook was tripped up was when Representative Joe Neguse (D-CO) asked whether Apple\u2019s apps have to abide by the same rules that third-party app makers must with regards to the App Store.While Cook said he believed that to be the case, Neguse pointed to the fact that while Apple forbids app makers from releasing copy-cat apps, Apple is able to copy apps submitted to its store.It was as a statement Cook was unable to square with his contention that Apple follows the same rules as third-party app makers.Overall, Apple emerged from the hearing relatively unscathed compared to his peers. But the hearing itself is just a piece of the committee\u2019s hearing, and the company still has to contend with the Department of Justice and state attorneys general investigations into the business.Got a tip?
