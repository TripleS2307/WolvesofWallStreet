Vehicle sales were RMB3,486.1 million (US$493.4 million) in the second quarter of 2020, representing an increase of 146.5% from the second quarter of 2019 and an increase of 177.6% from the first quarter of 2020. The increase in vehicle sales of the second quarter of 2020, compared to the second quarter of 2019, was mainly contributed by the sales of the ES6 which began deliveries in late June 2019. The increase in vehicle sales of the second quarter of 2020, compared to the first quarter of 2020, was due to the increase of vehicle deliveries recovered from the COVID-19 outbreak in China.Other sales in the second quarter of 2020 were RMB232.8 million (US$33.0 million), representing an increase of 147.7% from the second quarter of 2019 and an increase of 100.0% from the first quarter of 2020. The increase in other sales of the second quarter of 2020, compared to the second quarter of 2019, was mainly attributed to increased revenues derived from the home chargers installed, service package and energy package subscribed, and accessories sold, which were in line with the increased vehicle sales in the second quarter of 2020.Cost of Sales and Gross MarginCost of sales in the second quarter of 2020 was RMB3,405.8 million (US$482.1 million), representing an increase of 69.2% from the second quarter of 2019 and an increase of 121.2% from the first quarter of 2020. The increase in cost of sales compared to the second quarter of 2019 was mainly driven by the increase of delivery volume of the ES6 and the ES8 in the second quarter of 2020.Gross profit in the second quarter of 2020 was RMB313.1 million (US$44.3 million), representing an increase of RMB817.3 million from a gross loss of RMB504.2 million in the second quarter of 2019 and an increase of RMB480.6 million from a gross loss of RMB167.5 million in the first quarter of 2020. The increase of gross profit compared to the second quarter of 2019 was mainly contributed by increased vehicle sales, and incurrence of the one-off cost in relation to the Company\u2019s voluntary battery recall in the second quarter of 2019.Gross margin in the second quarter of 2020 was 8.4%, compared with negative 33.4% in the second quarter of 2019 and negative 12.2% in the first quarter of 2020. The increase of gross margin compared to the second quarter of 2019 was mainly driven by the increase of vehicle margin in the second quarter of 2020. Vehicle margin in the second quarter of 2020 was 9.7%, compared with negative 24.1% in the second quarter of 2019 and negative 7.4% in the first quarter of 2020. The increase of vehicle margin compared to the second quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020 was mainly driven by the decrease in purchase price of certain materials and lower unit manufacturing cost attributed from increased production volume of the ES6 and the ES8 in the second quarter of 2020. Besides above, the increase of vehicle margin in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the second quarter of 2019 was also attributable to the impact of the one-off cost in relation to the Company\u2019s voluntary battery recall in the second quarter of 2019.Operating ExpensesResearch and development expenses in the second quarter of 2020 were RMB545.2 million (US$77.2 million), representing a decrease of 58.1% from the second quarter of 2019 and an increase of 4.4% from the first quarter of 2020. Excluding share-based compensation expenses (non-GAAP), research and development expenses were RMB533.5 million (US$75.5 million), representing a decrease of 58.4% from the second quarter of 2019 and an increase of 3.7% from the first quarter of 2020. The decrease in research and development expenses over the second quarter of 2019 was primarily attributable to the incurrence of expenses relating to rigorous testing activities of ES6 in the second quarter of 2019 before its mass production. Research and development expenses remained relatively stable compared with the first quarter of 2020, which mainly consisted of costs incurred for recurring projects, while mass investment stage has not yet reached for new projects.Selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2020 were RMB936.8 million (US$132.6 million), representing a decrease of 34.1% from the second quarter of 2019 and an increase of 10.4% from the first quarter of 2020. Excluding share-based compensation expenses (non-GAAP), selling, general and administrative expenses were RMB904.5 million (US$128.0 million), representing a decrease of 33.1% from the second quarter of 2019 and an increase of 9.7% from the first quarter of 2020. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses over the second quarter of 2019 was primarily driven by the Company\u2019s overall cost-saving efforts and the improved operating efficiency in marketing and other supporting functions. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses over the first quarter of 2020 was primarily attributed to increased marketing and promotional activities and costs recovered from the COVID-19 outbreak in the first quarter of 2020.Loss from OperationsLoss from operations was RMB1,160.0 million (US$164.2 million) in the second quarter of 2020, representing a decrease of 64.0% from the second quarter of 2019 and a decrease of 26.1% from the first quarter of 2020. Excluding share-based compensation expenses, adjusted loss from operations (non-GAAP) was RMB1,114.7 million (US$157.8 million) in the second quarter of 2020, representing a decrease of 64.4% from the second quarter of 2019 and a decrease of 27.5% from the first quarter of 2020.Share-based Compensation ExpensesShare-based compensation expenses in the second quarter of 2020 were RMB45.3 million (US$6.4 million), representing a decrease of 50.9% from the second quarter of 2019 and an increase of 39.8% from the first quarter of 2020. The decrease in share-based compensation expenses over the second quarter of 2019 was primarily due to less options granted driven by the decline in the number of employees, and the impact of part of the share-based compensation expenses being recognized by using the accelerated method, under which the expenses decrease gradually over the vesting period. The increase in share-based compensation expenses over the first quarter of 2020 was primarily attributed to the incremental options granted in the second quarter of 2020.Net Loss and Earnings Per ShareNet loss was RMB1,176.7 million (US$166.5 million) in the second quarter of 2020, representing a decrease of 64.2% from the second quarter of 2019 and a decrease of 30.4% from the first quarter of 2020.

Excluding share-based compensation expenses and accretion on redeemable non-controlling interests to redemption value, adjusted net loss attributable to NIO\u2019s ordinary shareholders (non-GAAP) was RMB1,131.0 million (US$160.1 million).Basic and diluted net loss per ADS were both RMB1.15 (US$0.16) in the second quarter of 2020.

Based on its evaluation which considers the progress of the investments in NIO China, the Company believes that its existing working capital, the funds from the investments in NIO China and available loan facilities will be sufficient to support the Company's continuous operations and developments in the next twelve months.Business OutlookFor the third quarter of 2020, the Company expects:Deliveries of the vehicles to be between 11,000 and 11,500 vehicles, representing an increase of approximately 129.2% to 139.6% from the same quarter of 2019, and an increase of approximately 6.5% to 11.3% from the second quarter of 2020.Total revenues to be between RMB4,047.5 million (US$572.9 million) and RMB4,212.3 million (US$596.2 million), representing an increase of approximately 120.4% to 129.3% from the same quarter of 2019, and an increase of approximately 8.8% to 13.3% from the second quarter of 2020.This business outlook reflects the Company\u2019s current and preliminary view on the business situation and market condition, which is subject to change.Conference CallThe Company\u2019s management will host an earnings conference call at 8:00 AM U.S. Eastern Time on August 11, 2020 (8:00 PM Beijing/Hong Kong Time on August 11, 2020) to discuss financial results and answer questions from investors and analysts.
