But for co-CEO Reed Hastings, who co-founded Netflix in 1997, the early years are a reminder of how much tenacity it took to survive.Hastings recounts one particularly memorable \u2014 and now memorialized \u2014 anecdote in his new book, written with leadership and culture writer Erin Meyer, \u201cNo Rules Rules: Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention.\u201dIn 2000, Hastings tried to sell Netflix to Blockbuster for $50 million and was turned away by then-CEO John Antioco.In the early-aughts, Blockbuster was widely regarded as the visionary leader in home entertainment. The behemoth popularized the video rental model on a large scale. At its peak, Blockbuster had over 9,000 stores globally. Netflix had just stepped into the scene, focusing on the DVD-by-mail space, eventually building out its streaming technology platform.When asked about getting rebuffed, Hastings said, \u201cWell, now I say thank God that they didn't want to go ahead [with the deal]. But you know, at the time, they were so formidable and even later, when we went public, we were $50 million in revenue, and they were $5 billion, so a hundred times larger than us.\u201d\u201cSo for our first decade, [Blockbuster] was such a big gorilla over our future. And back to the role of luck. It was a number of things that made it possible for us to thrive, and eventually then have the chance to move into streaming,\u201d Hastings told Yahoo Finance during an episode of \u201cInfluencers with Andy Serwer,\u201d a weekly interview series with leaders in business, politics, and entertainment.Reed Hastings, co-founder and CEO of Netflix attends the inauguration of Netflix new offices in Paris, France, January 17, 2020. REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes\u201cIn 1997, it was clear that the internet was growing and getting faster, and would someday be able to do television. And that\u2019s what made me differentially confident that you could do DVD by mail for a couple years and then evolve into streaming,\u201d added Hastings.Today, Netflix has a market cap of $223.5 billion, with 193 million paid subscribers devouring its content across 190 countries. While Hastings has cited competition from its counterparts like Apple+ (AAPL), HBO Max (T), Hulu and Disney+ (DIS), along with unconventional players like TikTok and sleep, the iconic brand remains the shiny gem in the streaming arena. Over the last few years Netflix has clinched exclusive deals with the likes of Shonda Rhimes, the Obamas, and most recently, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.Story continuesMeanwhile, Blockbuster has dwindled into a nostalgic relic of the past. Today, the world\u2019s last remaining Blockbuster in Bend, Ore., has been turned into a gimmick on Airbnb. Deschutes County residents who find it \u201cimpossible to forget the feeling, smells, and sounds of a Blockbuster store\u2019s possibility-filled aisles,\u201d can pay four dollars to have a slumber party in the store.
