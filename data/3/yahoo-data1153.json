That month, open positions at the 30 most valuable start-ups in the United States fell 19%, according to Thinknum Alternative Data reported by the New York Times.The economic pain has struck even trendy sectors like artificial intelligence and co-working spaces. Starsky Robotics, a San Francisco-based driverless company that had raised more than $20 million, closed in March. Flexible office-space provider Knotel laid off half of its 400 employees, and competitor Convene laid off a fifth of its staff and furloughed half of remaining employees.Story continuesMehta said the economic headwinds may be compounded by new or young founders who lack experience managing companies in turmoil.\u201cA lot of the companies that Fast Company writes about got started in 2008, 2009, 2010,\u201d she says. \u201cSo these are founders and CEOs and leadership teams that have never been through a downturn \u2014 have never been through a crisis.\u201dFast Company Editor-in-Chief Stephanie Mehta appears on \"Influencers with Andy Serwer.\"Mehta made the remarks in an episode of Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cInfluencers with Andy Serwer,\u201d a weekly interview series with leaders in business, politics, and entertainment.Since 2018, Mehta has served as the editor-in-chief of Fast Company.
