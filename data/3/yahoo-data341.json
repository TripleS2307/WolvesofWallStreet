According to reports, he has only shown mild symptoms so far.\u201cIt is just hours into him knowing he\u2019s positive, and he was tested based on contact tracing, which meant that he was tested frequently and early,\u201d Dr. Dara Kass, an emergency medicine physician at Columbia University, said on Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade (video above). \u201cBut the fact is it\u2019s very early in his course, and whether or not he\u2019s going to develop... serious symptoms is still very much to be determined.\u201dPresident Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally at the Duluth International Airport on September 30, 2020 in Duluth, Minnesota. (Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)The news about Trump\u2019s diagnosis came only hours after it was revealed that his close adviser, Hope Hicks, had also tested positive for the virus. Hicks had been part of his campaign team that traveled with the president, largely unmasked and not adhering to social distancing.It\u2019s unclear if anyone else in the president\u2019s envoy has also tested positive. Barron Trump, the president\u2019s son, Vice President Mike Pence, and Second Lady Karen Pence tested negative.\u2018An unpredictable course\u2019While the president has reportedly only displayed cold-like symptoms so far, there are many factors that could contribute to him becoming sicker.Kass noted that the 74-year-old Trump is considered elderly, which is a high-risk demographic that\u2019s been particularly hit hard by the virus. The president is also male and medically obese, which puts him at a higher risk for acute and long-term complications.White House Deputy Chief of Staff Dan Scavino and counselor to the president Hope Hicks celebrate after U.S. President Donald Trump delivered his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, August 27, 2020. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\u201cOver 7 million Americans have had this virus and many of them have what we call long-hauler symptoms \u2014 continued symptoms of shortness of breath, of maybe blood clots or kidney damage or other foggy thinking,\u201d Kass said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of neurological complications of this virus, so we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in the acute phase, the phase that he\u2019s infected and isolated, or what the recovery would look like. And that\u2019s true for the First Lady, it\u2019s true for Hope Hicks. This virus has an unpredictable course.\u201dStory continuesAnd according to a CDC report, 35% of symptomatic patients had not returned to their normal state of health after 2-3 weeks from getting the virus. For those between the ages of 18 to 34 with no chronic conditions, 20% hadn\u2019t returned to their usual health.\u2018Could be hundreds of people\u2019 exposed to infected President TrumpTrump has been publicly skeptical about the efficacy of masks and social distancing while prioritizing the reopening state economies over stay-at-home orders.He has also continued to hold rallies attracting mass crowds while rarely wearing a mask in public. Even after Hicks tested positive, Trump and his team flew to New Jersey for a campaign fundraiser where he was in contact with dozens of people at a roundtable event.Supporters, many not wearing masks, gather for an indoor rally with U.S. President Donald Trump in Henderson, Nevada, U.S. September 13, 2020. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst TPX IMAGES OF THE DAYThis means that it\u2019s unclear how many people could have been exposed to the president while he was carrying the virus.\u201cWe don\u2019t know that it\u2019s only dozens of people,\u201d Kass said. \u201cIt could be hundreds of people because of the entire entourage that travels with the president, if they were within six of the president, unmasked for over 15 minutes, they are at risk and need to be quarantined for 14 days regardless of negative tests.\u201dThis includes figures like members of the Cabinet, senators, and even Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett (although she tested negative according to reports).\u201cWe just don\u2019t know how many people were in contact with the president or any other positive patients at this point,\u201d Kass said, adding: \u201cIt reminds us even if you are negative or until you find out you\u2019re positive, what you do in that interim period of time is what determines how many people in your life are affected by your positive diagnosis.\u201dEric Trump, Ivanka Trump, Melania Trump, Tiffany Trump and Donald Trump Jr. are seen ahead of the first presidential debate at the Case Western Reserve University and Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio on September 29, 2020.

According to reports, the Trump family and his team declined to wear masks after they were approached and asked to wear one. Hicks was among those individuals and may have been positive with the virus at the time.Kass said \u201cit is possible\u201d the debate could be a super-spreader event as a result of this, potentially exposing Biden, his team, and even debate moderator Chris Wallace.And once the president recovers, Kass hopes he goes back into the regular world following proper protocol.\u201cWith a mask on, staying distant, remembering that he has to keep protecting other people from him and himself from other people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd unfortunately, that\u2019s not how he was behaving before this.\u201dAdriana Belmonte is a reporter and editor covering politics and health care policy for Yahoo Finance.
