Just get another bank account \u2014 or three", "body": "If you have an online savings account, chances are you\u2019ve received a lot of emails in the past two years telling you your rates are being cut.Around two years ago, many online savings banks like Ally (ALLY), American Express (AXP), Barclays (BCS), Goldman Sachs\u2019s Marcus (GS), CIT (CIT), Citi (C), Synchrony (SYF), and more were offering interest rates well over 2.00% for savings accounts.Read more: How to save money for short-, mid-, and long-term goalsBack then, interest rates were higher and online banks competed readily for deposits \u2014 as did many robo-advisors like Betterment, Wealthfront, and even the investing app, Robinhood.An interesting aspect of lower rates is that the order has also changed. The bank that offered the best in 2018 may be down the list today. For example, CIT was the most generous back then, but now Citi pays out the highest, with 0.90% APY.If you\u2019re looking to maximize your interest so you\u2019re earning as much as possible on your savings or emergency fund, it can pay to be proactive and move your money.A woman looks at Marcus, a new savings and loans app recently launched by Goldman Sachs in New York, U.S., January 10, 2020. REUTERS/Mike SegarToday, it\u2019s very easy to set up an account with an online savings bank, and according to Greg McBride, Bankrate\u2019s chief financial analyst, there\u2019s no downside to having a bunch of accounts like there is with credit cards \u2014 \u201cunless you consider keeping track of them a downside,\u201d he said. Setting up an account doesn\u2019t hurt your credit or make enemies with a bank.That means you could easily set up multiple accounts with various online savings banks and simply transfer money to the one that pays the most. Interbank transfers are generally done via ACH methods, which are easy to do through banks\u2019 websites and are free, taking a couple days to clear.However, for most people, the upside to switching to a different high-yield account isn\u2019t particularly high. The difference of 0.80% to 0.90% is far less than the difference between having a traditional savings account (they pay around 0.09% APY on average, according to Bankrate) and any of the high-yield online savings accounts in question.Story continuesFor example, if you have $5,000 in cash, you\u2019ll only make $5 per year by going to Discover from Citizens Access (0.70% from 0.60%).So while people might get annoyed every time the bank notifies that the rates have fallen, the difference isn\u2019t much.\u2014Ethan Wolff-Mann is a writer at Yahoo Finance focusing on consumer issues, personal finance, retail, airlines, and more.
