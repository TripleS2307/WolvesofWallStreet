Over a quarter of that reserve ($22.9 billion) was added just over the last quarter, illustrating the increasingly pessimistic expectations for the volume of loans that will become non-performing.Bank of America (BAC), which rounds out the big four U.S. banks, will report its earnings before the market bell on Thursday.At the nation\u2019s largest bank, executives cautioned that their credit models still face uncertainty around the path of the virus and the lack of clarity on further government stimulus.\u201cWe've put more meaningful weight on the downside scenario this quarter,\u201d JPMorgan Chase CFO Jennifer Piepszak said. \u201cAnd so therefore, we're prepared and have reserved for something worse than the base case.\u201dJPMorgan Chase has already seen the ratio of nonperforming loans relative to total loans rise by 31 basis points year-over-year to 0.82%.But Wells Fargo CFO John Shrewsberry told reporters Tuesday that the amount of delinquent or non-performing assets for the current quarter may be understating the fact that many lenders have offered temporary deferrals on loan payments.\u201cIt\u2019ll be two or three quarters out before they hit their cyclical high points,\u201d Shrewsberry said.Murky outlookStory continuesThe main question: did the big banks set aside too much or too little in reserves?An accounting change known as Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) may give reason to interpreting the reserve figures as more conservative. The large banks had been phasing in the new CECL standards well before COVID-19, which broadly requires banks to recognize expected losses as an allowance.\u201cGiven CECL covers the life of the loan, if our assumptions are realized, we wouldn't expect meaningful additional reserve builds going forward,\u201d JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Piepszak told analysts.But RBC Capital Markets analyst Gerard Cassidy told Yahoo Finance Tuesday that \u201cin all candor, none of [the banks] really know\u201d if their provisions will be enough. Predicting the path of the virus is getting more difficult as pockets of the country continue to face difficulty in controlling the spread of COVID-19.\u201cThat\u2019s why the stocks trade the way they do: super cheap relative to the market on a price to book value basis,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cBut everybody\u2019s just uncertain on what the outlook is going to be on the banks over the next six months.\u201dIf the economy can bounce back quickly, the banks will be able to breathe easily knowing that it over-provisioned the damage to its loan portfolios. But if a lack of control forces more shutdowns, business closures, and layoffs, then it may need more buffer.JPMorgan\u2019s Jamie Dimon is prepared for the worse.\u201cIt's just going to be murky,\u201d Dimon said Tuesday.Brian Cheung is a reporter covering the Fed, economics, and banking for Yahoo Finance.
