The blue-chip index has now climbed about 50% from its March low.[Click here to read what\u2019s moving markets heading into Thursday, August 13]Leadership in the S&P 500 flipped back to the technology and health-care sectors, unwinding a rotation into cyclicals that had begun last week. Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) led gains in the Dow, and the Nasdaq outperformed.Shares of Moderna (MRNA) held onto overnight gains, after the company announced a deal to supply the US government with 100 million doses of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate currently in late-stage human trials. Meanwhile, Tesla\u2019s stock (TSLA) rose about 6% after the company announced a five-for-one stock split, with the stock having closed at well over $1,300 per share earlier Tuesday.Stocks\u2019 drop on Tuesday \u2013 the first for the S&P 500 and Dow in eight sessions \u2013 came as prospects for a near-term virus relief package from Congress dimmed. Primary negotiators including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have not met since Friday to discuss a new package, with lawmakers still deeply divided on the amount of aid to be unleashed to state and local governments.Other national developments also added to a risk-off mood Tuesday afternoon. The Big Ten Conference and Pac-12 each announced that they would be postponing their fall sports seasons as concerns over the ongoing coronavirus pandemic abounded, following days of speculation over the fate of one of the big revenue drivers for major universities.\u201cHaving college football in the fall is a sign of normalcy returning,\u201d Jim Bianco, Bianco Research President and CEO, told Yahoo Finance during \u201cThe Final Round\u201d on Tuesday.The season\u2019s postponement \u201cis an indication to everybody in those neighborhoods, or those states, that things have not returned to normal yet,\u201d Bianco said. \u201cThe big one in college football is the SEC, from Florida to Arkansas, all the way to South Carolina and Clemson \u2013 they haven\u2019t said anything. But I think if they were to delay to the spring as well, that could actually bleed into the election, too. You\u2019d be telling everybody in that important place for voting, it ain\u2019t ready yet. It ain\u2019t right yet.\u201dStory continuesElsewhere, earnings season continues Wednesday with a relatively light slate of companies set to report, including Lyft (LYFT), Tencent (0700.HK) and Cisco (CSCO).\u20144:03 p.m. ET: Stocks close higher after S&P 500 briefly touches record highHere were the main moves in markets as of 4:03 p.m. ET:S&P 500 (^GSPC): +46.64 (+1.40%) to 3,380.33Dow (^DJI): +289.64 (+1.05%) to 27,976.55Nasdaq (^IXIC): +229.42 (+2.13%) to 11,012.24Crude (CL=F): +$0.96 (+2.31%) to $42.57 a barrelGold (GC=F): -$17.60 (-0.90%) to $1,928.70 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): +1.2 bps to yield 0.6700%\u20143:15 p.m. ET: S&P 500 rallies above February record highThe S&P 500 extended gains with less than an hour left of trading, rising more than 1.5% to above 3,386.15, or the level of its February 19 record closing high.This brought the index\u2019s gain since its March 23 closing low to more than 50%.\u20142:03 p.m. ET: Tech regains lead in the major indices; Nasdaq advances 2%Each of the three major indices rose, and the Nasdaq outperformed and paced toward its first advance in four sessions.

Bank stocks lagged.The Dow added more than 200 points, led by shares of Microsoft and Apple.\u201411:57 a.m. ET: \u2018Right now the bond market really isn\u2019t showing me signs that this equity rally cannot continue\u2019: RiverFront Global Fixed Income Co-CIOUS Treasuries have been in a holding pattern, with longer-duration bonds yielding well under 1% for the better part of the year so far. The recent anchor on yields has come in part as negotiations in Washington on further fiscal stimulus and economic support hang in balance, said Kevin Nicholson, RiverFront Investment Group Global Fixed Income Co-CIO.\u201cThe bond market has been interesting because we\u2019ve been hovering close to the lows for the year as far as yields are concerned, and that is really because I think that they\u2019re looking for Washington to actually get a deal done,\u201d he said during Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cThe First Trade\u201d on Wednesday. \u201cAnd because they\u2019ve been not negotiating well with one another over the last couple of weeks, we\u2019ve seen the kind of risk-off in the bond market, because I think that they\u2019re afraid if we don\u2019t get people back to work, we\u2019re going to see the economy slow down.\u201dThat cautiousness, however, hasn\u2019t translated across the bond market as a flashing red signal for equities, which to date have continued to march higher despite lingering economic weakness.\u201cI like to look at high-yield CDS, the high-yield credit default swaps market \u2013 what you\u2019re seeing is spreads are coming down,\u201d Nicholson said. \u201cThe cost to insure is coming down. So that is actually a risk on indicator for equities. And so right now the bond market really isn\u2019t showing me signs that this equity rally cannot continue.\u201dAs for his firm\u2019s own recent trades, Nicholson said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been focused on one- to five-year corporate bonds because that\u2019s what the Fed was buying in their program in their bond buying program, but also when we look at the treasury market, we have some long duration there on the long end of the curve as far as treasuries are concerned. Overall we\u2019re still underweight fixed income in the portfolios.\u201d\u201410:13 a.m. ET: Fed\u2019s Rosengren says unchecked coronavirus pandemic in some states \u2018likely to prolong the economic downturn\u2019Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren said Wednesday that fiscal and monetary stimulus, while critical to supporting the economy, \u201ccannot fully offset the economic drain caused by the public health crisis.\u201d\u201cLimited or inconsistent efforts by states to control the virus based on public health guidance are not only placing citizens at unnecessary risk of severe illness and possible death \u2013 but are also likely to prolong the economic downturn,\u201d Rosengren said in prepared remarks to the South Shore Chamber of Commerce.Rosengren also re-upped his defense of the Fed\u2019s Main Street Lending Program, which has set aside hundreds of billions of dollars for loans to small- and mid-sized businesses hit by the pandemic but seen slow adoption so far among these businesses.\u201cShould the fall bring a resurgence of the virus as many epidemiological models predict, this program may become even more essential,\u201d he said.\u2014\u20149:36 a.m. ET: Stocks open higher, Dow adds 200+ pointsHere were the main moves in markets as of 9:36 a.m. ET:S&P 500 (^GSPC): +32.21 points (+0.97%) to 3,365.90Dow (^DJI): +264.02 points (+0.95%) to 27,950.93Nasdaq (^IXIC): +124.42 points (+1.15%) to 10,908.07Crude (CL=F): +$0.81 (+1.95%) to $42.42 a barrelGold (GC=F): +$5.30 (+0.27%) to $1,951.60 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): +1.3 bps to yield 0.671%\u2014\u20148:30 a.m. ET: Consumer prices rise more than expected in July as energy prices advance; food prices fall for the first time in more than a yearAn index tracking changes in consumer prices jumped more than expected in July, pointing to firming inflationary trends as energy prices extended their march higher.The Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.6% in July to match June\u2019s pace of increase.
