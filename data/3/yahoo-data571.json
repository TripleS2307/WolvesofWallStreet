The current minimum wage is $12 per hour for businesses with fewer than 26 employees, and $13 for those with more.Barring an intervention by officials, the minimum wage in several states is set to increase by $1 or less on July 1 \u2013 including Illinois, which will raise its minimum wage from $9.25 to $10, Nevada from $8.25 to $9, and Oregon from $11.25 to $12.While state officials in California, Massachusetts, Illinois and Michigan are resisting corporate pressure, Virginia\u2019s General Assembly did vote in April to postpone a planned minimum wage hike to $9.50 from $7.25 by four months from January to May 2021.But according to EPI, the coronavirus recession has not changed the case for raising the minimum wage, rather it has highlighted its importance.\u201cIf anything, current conditions make it even more important for governments to strengthen pay standards, especially those that help low-income households\u2019\u201d wrote EPI\u2019s Senior Economic Analyst David Cooper. \u201cFrom a general macroeconomic perspective, raising the minimum wage in a period of depressed consumer demand is smart policy.\u201dRaising wages for low-wage workers, the portion of the workforce that will spend a larger share of their income, boosts overall consumer demand.

Raising the minimum wage would help solve the demand problem more effectively than other recession response measures.\u201cBusiness-oriented relief measures all can help firms weather a downturn, but they\u2019re not going to drive additional spending in the same way that a minimum wage hike does,\u201d wrote Cooper.The most effective policy response would be to allow minimum wage increases to continue as planned in order to boost consumer demand, while also offering small businesses further support such as tax deferrals, loans, and rent subsidies that could help them survive the coronavirus pandemic, according to EPI.More from Sibile:Master P on Aunt Jemima, Uncle Ben\u2019s: \u2018Those are not real people\u2019How JPMorgan Chase is making banking \u2018cool\u2019 for black teenagersKareem Abdul-Jabbar on how Bruce Lee beat the system, fought racismKareem Abdul-Jabbar on George Floyd protests: Black Americans have been playing catch-up economically since the Civil WarKareem Abdul-Jabbar: \u2018The NFL got on the right side of history\u2019Find live stock market quotes and the latest business and finance news"}]}
