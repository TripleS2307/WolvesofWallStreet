Some 600,000 passengers went through airport security checkpoints Monday. Passenger traffic was down 79% year-over-year for the week ending June 26. That was a slight improvement from the previous week which saw traffic down 81% compared to the same period in 2019.Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth, in a recent note to clients, warned the recent surge in coronavirus infections could threaten the recovery in airline passenger loads. \u201cIt remains to be seen if recent upticks in cases in select states could slow or even reverse momentum (absent potential holiday distortions) as economies continue to gradually reopen\u201d Syth wrote.United Airlines, Boeing, 787, Dreamliner, Parked at the gate, Auckland International Airport, New Zealand, 7 January 2020Turbulence ahead for the airlinesUnited says it plans to fly 40% of its overall schedule in August compared to 2019, saying, \u201ccustomers are slowly returning to flying with a preference for leisure destinations\u201d to see friends and family.Delta Air Lines (DAL) CEO Ed Bastian cited the same trend when he told Yahoo Finance that the airline added 100 flights back to its daily schedule in June. \u201cYou start to see how the revenue is climbing by staying very disciplined on cost, capping load factors and adding flights back as demand returns,\u201d he said.But Bastian warns the recent rise in coronavirus cases nationwide may slow Delta\u2019s plan to add flights past August. \u201cWhile it\u2019s encouraging to see flights returning... we likely remain at least two years away from a return to normal,\u201d he said during a virtual town hall last week with employees.Story continuesUnited appears more optimistic saying it will add close to 600 daily flights to more than 200 airports across the United States this month and next. United also says demand for international travel is improving.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen increasing demand for leisure travel and have added options to places like Cancun and reinstated service to Tahiti,\u201d said Patrick Quayle, United\u2019s vice president of international network and alliances.The airline plans to resume direct flights from Chicago and New York to Brussels, Frankfurt, Munich and Zurich. But Tuesday\u2019s decision by the European Union to deny entrance to U.S. citizens could slow United\u2019s strategy to fly 25% of its Atlantic schedule in August. United says it adjusted its schedule with that in mind and points out the U.S. remains closed to travelers from Europe. The airline expects border restrictions to ease and travelers to return.\u201cDemand is coming back slowly and we\u2019re building in enough capacity to stay ahead of the number of people traveling,\u201d Gupta said.Adam Shapiro is co-anchor of Yahoo Finance\u2019s On the Move.'The corporate tax rate \u2014 I\u2019m actually OK at 28%': Gary CohnDelta CEO trying to avoid furloughs 'any way we possibly can' as airlines recoverJ&J exec: Our coronavirus vaccine is aiming for a 70% success rate in trialsRisk firm: 'American is most at risk' of coronavirus default among US airlinesSouthwest warns that revenue could drop as much as 95% in MayDelta shores up liquidity as coronavirus pummels demand, warns of smaller airlineFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit"}]}
