Congress passed enough aid to bridge most businesses and workers through the end of July, as governors and mayors tested trial-and-error ways of reopening their economies while subduing the virus.Some of the damage companies were hoping to forestall is now becoming permanent. Several large companies have started announcing four- and five-digit layoffs, as they adjust to a long-term drop in demand. Casino operator MGM has permanently laid off 18,000 workers who were on temporary furlough. That\u2019s one-fourth of its total workforce. MGM has been able to reopen its casinos, but travelers to Las Vegas and other resort areas simply aren\u2019t showing up in the numbers they used to. After Sept. 30, MGM\u2019s laid-off workers will lose company-provided health insurance and other benefits.American Airlines, barely airborne, is preparing to lay off 19,000 workers on October 1. In a letter to employees, CEO Doug Parker pointed out that an aid package for airlines Congress passed in March assumed the coronavirus pandemic would be under control by September. \u201cThat is obviously not the case,\u201d he said.Delta, for its part, is planning to lay off more than 1,900 pilots. \u201cWe are six months into this pandemic and only 25% of our revenues have been recovered,\u201d a top executive explained to employees recently. \u201cUnfortunately, we see few catalysts over the next six months to meaningfully change this trajectory.\"Coca-Cola, struggling with lost sales from closed restaurants, said this week it\u2019s cutting 4,000 jobs through buyouts and layoffs. Salesforce said on August 26 it\u2019s cutting 1,000 jobs. Thousands of smaller companies and other organizations are throwing in the towel and starting to slash staff permanently. This, of course, comes on top of the 13 million jobs that have been eliminated since February, raising the unemployment rate from 3.5% to 10.2%.More large layoff announcements are probably coming. Trump is touting an economic recovery, but if big companies with access to all necessary financing can\u2019t keep payrolls intact, the hole might be getting deeper rather than shallower. This week\u2019s Trump-o-meter reads SAD, the lowest rating.Story continuesTrumpometerAt this week\u2019s Republican convention, there was barely any acknowledgment of the coronavirus pandemic or the deep recession it has caused. Trump said he has \u201cdone more for the African-American community than any president since Abraham Lincoln,\u201d even though the unemployment rate for Black Americans is a stratospheric 14.6%. White House economist Larry Kudlow ticked off five economic booms\u2014stocks, housing, auto sales, manufacturing and consumer spending\u2014without mentioning that most of those things remain far below pre-virus levels. Kudlow also referred to the pandemic in the past tense, as if it\u2019s over and everybody\u2019s fine now.Trump obviously needs to persuade voters the economy is healing and they should give him another four years to see the convalescence through. But the economy may not be healing. Congress can\u2019t muster another stimulus bill, and the White House isn\u2019t generating any heat under Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Recent consumer confidence numbers remain depressed. More than a million workers continue to file initial unemployment claims each week. The monthly job numbers come on Sept. 4, and they\u2019ll reveal whether we\u2019re going forward or back. Mounting layoffs may already tell us.Rick Newman is the author of four books, including \u201cRebounders: How Winners Pivot from Setback to Success.\u201d Follow him on Twitter: @rickjnewman.
