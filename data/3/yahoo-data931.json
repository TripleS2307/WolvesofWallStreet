(AP) \u2014 Joe Biden named California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate on Tuesday, making history by selecting the first Black woman to compete on a major party\u2019s presidential ticket and acknowledging the vital role Black voters will play in his bid to defeat President Donald Trump.In choosing Harris, Biden is embracing a former rival from the Democratic primary who is familiar with the unique rigor of a national campaign. The 55-year-old first-term senator, who is also of South Asian descent, is one of the party\u2019s most prominent figures. She quickly became a top contender for the No. 2 spot after her own White House campaign ended.She will appear with Biden for the first time as his running mate at an event Wednesday near his home in Wilmington, Delaware.In announcing the pick, Biden called Harris a \u201cfearless fighter for the little guy, and one of the country's finest public servants.\u201d She said Biden would \u201cunify the American people\" and \u201cbuild an America that lives up to our ideals.\u201dHarris joins Biden at a moment of unprecedented national crisis. The coronavirus pandemic has claimed the lives of more than 160,000 people in the U.S., far more than the toll experienced in other countries. Business closures and disruptions resulting from the pandemic have caused severe economic problems. Unrest, meanwhile, has emerged across the country as Americans protest racism and police brutality.Trump\u2019s uneven handling of the crises has given Biden an opening, and he enters the fall campaign in strong position against the president. In adding Harris to the ticket, he can point to her relatively centrist record on issues such as health care and her background in law enforcement in the nation\u2019s largest state.The president told reporters Tuesday he was \u201ca little surprised\u201d that Biden picked Harris, pointing to their debate stage disputes during the primary. Trump, who had donated to her previous campaigns, argued she was \u201cabout the most liberal person in the U.S. Senate.\u201dStory continues\u201cI would have thought that Biden would have tried to stay away from that a little bit,\u201d he said.Harris\u2019s record as California attorney general and district attorney in San Francisco was heavily scrutinized during the Democratic primary and turned away some liberals and younger Black voters who saw her as out of step on issues of racism in the legal system and police brutality. She declared herself a \u201cprogressive prosecutor\u201d who backs law enforcement reforms.Biden, who spent eight years as President Barack Obama\u2019s vice president, has spent months weighing who would fill that same role in his White House. He pledged in March to select a woman as his vice president, easing frustration among Democrats that the presidential race would center on two white men in their 70s.Biden\u2019s search was expansive, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a leading progressive; Florida Rep. Val Demings, whose impeachment criticism of Trump won party plaudits; California Rep. Karen Bass, who leads the Congressional Black Caucus; former Obama national security adviser Susan Rice; and Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, whose passionate response to unrest in her city garnered national attention.A woman has never served as president or vice president in the United States. Hillary Clinton was the Democratic presidential nominee in 2016. Two women have been nominated as running mates on major party tickets: Democrat Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 and Republican Sarah Palin in 2008. Their parties lost in the general election.The vice presidential pick carries increased significance this year. If elected, Biden would be 78 when inaugurated in January, the oldest man to ever assume the presidency. He\u2019s spoken of himself as a transitional figure and hasn\u2019t fully committed to seeking a second term in 2024.Harris, born in 1964 to a Jamaican father and Indian mother, spent much of her formative years in Berkeley, California. She has often spoken of the deep bond she shared with her mother, whom she has called her single biggest influence.Harris won her first election in 2003 when she became San Francisco\u2019s district attorney. In that post, she created a reentry program for low-level drug offenders and cracked down on student truancy.She was elected California\u2019s attorney general in 2010, the first woman and Black person to hold the job, and focused on issues including the foreclosure crisis. She declined to defend the state\u2019s Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage and was later overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court.After being elected to the Senate in 2016, she quickly gained attention for her assertive questioning of Trump administration officials during congressional hearings.Harris launched her presidential campaign in early 2019 with the slogan \u201cKamala Harris For the People,\u201d a reference to her courtroom work. She was one of the highest-profile contenders in a crowded Democratic primary and attracted 20,000 people to her first campaign rally in Oakland.But the early promise of her campaign eventually faded. Her law enforcement background prompted skepticism from some progressives, and she struggled to land on a consistent message that resonated with voters. Facing fundraising problems, she abruptly withdrew from the race in December 2019, two months before the first votes of the primary were cast.One standout moment of her presidential campaign came at the expense of Biden. During a debate, she said Biden made \u201cvery hurtful\u201d comments about his past work with segregationist senators and slammed his opposition to busing as schools began to integrate in the 1970s.\u201cThere was a little girl in California who was a part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that little girl was me.\u201dShaken by the attack, Biden called her comments \u201ca mischaracterization of my position.\u201dThe exchange resurfaced recently with a report that one of Biden\u2019s closest friends and a co-chair of his vice presidential vetting committee, former Connecticut Sen. Chris Dodd, still harbors concerns about the debate and that Harris hadn\u2019t expressed regret. The comments attributed to Dodd and first reported by Politico drew condemnation, especially from influential Democratic women who said Harris was being held to a standard that wouldn\u2019t apply to a man running for president.Some Biden confidants said Harris\u2019 debate attack did irritate the former vice president, who had a friendly relationship with her. Harris was also close with Biden\u2019s late son, Beau, who served as Delaware attorney general while she held the same post in California.But Biden and Harris have since returned to a warm relationship.\u201cJoe has empathy, he has a proven track record of leadership and more than ever before we need a president of the United States who understands who the people are, sees them where they are, and has a genuine desire to help and knows how to fight to get us where we need to be,\u201d Harris said at an event for Biden earlier this summer.At the same event, she bluntly assailed Trump, labeling him a \u201cdrug pusher\u201d for his promotion of the unproven and much-questioned malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for the coronavirus. After Trump tweeted \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts\u201d in response to protests about the death of George Floyd, a Black man in police custody, Harris said his remarks \u201cyet again show what racism looks like.\u201dHarris has taken a tougher stand on policing since Floyd\u2019s killing. She co-sponsored legislation in June that would ban police from using chokeholds and no-knock warrants, set a national use-of-force standard and create a national police misconduct registry, among other things. It would also reform the qualified immunity system that shields officers from liability.The list in the legislation included practices Harris did not vocally fight to reform while leading California\u2019s Department of Justice. And while she now wants independent investigations of police shootings, she didn\u2019t support a 2015 California bill that would have required her office to take on such cases.\u201cWe made progress, but clearly we are not at the place yet as a country where we need to be and California is no exception,\u201d she told The Associated Press recently. The national focus on racial injustice now, she said, shows \u201cthere\u2019s no reason that we have to continue to wait.\u201d___Ronayne reported from Sacramento, California.
