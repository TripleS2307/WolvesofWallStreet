It\u2019s the ninth time mortgage rates set a record low this year \u2014 and some experts think it won\u2019t be the last time.But rates are not as low as borrowers might expect because overworked lenders are keeping mortgage rates higher to try to slow the onslaught of mortgage and refinance applications, according to experts. Once lenders catch up, mortgage rates are expected to fall further.\u201cIt\u2019s not that they [lenders] don\u2019t want to drop rates. It\u2019s that they don\u2019t have the capacity to fulfill that mortgage request right now, on the refis [refinance applications] especially,\u201d Jeff Taylor, managing partner at Digital Risk, a Florida-based financial mortgage analytics company, told Yahoo Finance The Final Round.During the coronavirus pandemic, there has been a frenzy of refinancing and new mortgage application activity. Lenders are projected to dole out a record $3.9 trillion this year, and new home sales are projected to increase 14% this year compared to 2019, according to a new Fannie Mae forecast.\u201cWe\u2019re heading towards a $3 trillion residential mortgage market. That\u2019s the second biggest in the last 25 years, only behind 2003\u2026 Interest rates have lowered so much\u2026 And I see that market only getting hotter as the rest of this year goes on and all the way through 2021,\u201d said Taylor.The mortgage application process should take 30 to 45 days, but applicants are waiting an average of 45 to 120 days, according to Snapdocs, a San Francisco-based digital mortgage closing company.\u201cLow interest rates are driving a surge in purchase and refinance applications, and many lenders are getting crushed by the demand. Some are even throttling business by keeping interest rates at a level where they can ensure that they\u2019re able to fulfill the business they\u2019re getting. Lenders are starting to think that they won\u2019t be able to close new loans for six months, due to the incredibly high demand,\u201d said Snapdocs in a statement.Story continuesMost mortgage companies have tried to bring on more staff to deal with demand. Nonbank mortgage bankers\u2019 and brokers\u2019 payrolls were up 9% in July from last year, according to the Bureau of Labor statistics. Mr. Cooper, a Texas-based mortgage lender, is hiring 2,000 new employees, the company announced this month, Detroit-based lender Quicken Loans hired 4,000 new employees during the pandemic, and United Shore plans to hire a total of almost 1,500.\u201cThis kind of explosion in volume, you have to expand your staff, I think. There\u2019s really no way around it without burning out all your people,\u201d said Sheri Nedley, senior vice president of capital markets and operations at Florida-based The Mortgage Firm in a Snapdocs webinar last week.Some lenders like The Mortgage Firm and Wisconsin-based Waterstone Mortgage are adding technology to increase efficiency, offering customers online applications, digital closing and automated communication updates. Meanwhile, digital lenders and lending tech companies like eOriginal and New York-based Better.com have reported explosive demand during the pandemic.\u201cSometimes, change doesn\u2019t happen unless it is absolutely necessary. This is going to be the big push into digital mortgage closings,\u201d said John Moffatt, director of mortgage operations at Better.com, a New York-based digital mortgage lender had 200% application growth in March alone.Sarah Paynter is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
