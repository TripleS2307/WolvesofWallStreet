It won\u2019t be enough to trigger a recovery.\u201cAlmost nothing the federal government can do from an economic standpoint is going to make it feel like we\u2019re progressing into a recovery,\u201d Shai Akabas, director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, says on the latest episode of the Yahoo Finance Electionomics podcast. \u201cAt best, unemployment is going to stay in the high single-digits, if not the double-digits, through November.\u201dMost economists think another stimulus bill is necessary, to keep the unemployed above water, maintain a lifeline to struggling businesses, and help states and cities running way short on tax revenue. The problem is that no amount of stimulus spending will fully reopen businesses and coax consumers out of their homes as long as the coronavirus is rampant.The picture looked brighter in early June, when virus hotspots like Washington state and the Northeast were getting the virus under control, and it hadn\u2019t yet spread throughout the south and west. But a surge of cases in Florida, Texas, Arizona, California and other states has driven the coronavirus death toll over 1,000 per day and forced some areas to reimpose lockdowns. Consumers are reluctant to go out and it\u2019s becoming increasingly apparent there may not be an economic recovery until there\u2019s a vaccine for the virus.[Check out other episodes of the Electionomics podcast.]Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, center, and President Donald Trump's Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, right, walks into the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of Calif., on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, July 29, 2020, for a meeting with Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer of N.Y. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)Democrats and Republicans are negotiating now over how much aid business, workers, states and cities should get. The CARES Act, passed in March, provided $600 per week in supplemental unemployment insurance to every worker able to claim benefits through their state. That expires this week. Democrats want to reinstate the $600 weekly benefit through next January. Republicans say that\u2019s too high, because it\u2019s more than many workers were earning at their jobs in the first place and it could be an incentive to collect benefits instead going back to work. They favor a $200 weekly stipend for a shorter period of time.Story continuesAkabas thinks Republicans are right about the disincentive to work. \u201cAbout 20% of people are getting paid twice as much through unemployment as they were through their jobs,\u201d he says. \u201cTwo-thirds are getting paid more than prior wages. That\u2019s going to make a difference in terms of people returning to the labor force.\u201d In its own research, the Bipartisan Policy Center finds that a $400 weekly supplement is the optimal amount, while recommending that it be extended only through September and then reevaluated based on the situation at the time.Congress also seems likely to approve another $1,200 direct payment to most Americans, since Republicans and Democrats agree on that. There are still major disagreements on how much aid should go to states, cities and health-care systems, and whether Congress should shield businesses from liability if they reopen and workers or customers contract the virus.New York City, Chicago, Florida, and southern California were major hotspots. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance)All of this extraordinary spending is pushing the national debt to astronomical levels. The gap between spending and revenue in June alone was $864 billion\u2014nearly as large as the deficit for all of 2019. The Congressional Budget Office projects the 2020 deficit to be $3.7 trillion, and that\u2019s without the current stimulus bill Congress is negotiating now. That national debt\u2014the total amount Uncle Sam owes\u2014is now $26.5 trillion, which is larger than the size of the entire U.S. economy.The national debt is \u201cunfathomably large,\u201d Akabas says. \u201cWhen we get to the other side, there\u2019s going to be a very large problem waiting for us.\u201d The other side hasn\u2019t come into view, however, as coronavirus darkens the outlook. For now, the best Congress can do is nurse the damaged economy until the virus relents or humanity defeat it.Rick Newman is the author of four books, including \u201cRebounders: How Winners Pivot from Setback to Success.\u201d Follow him on Twitter: @rickjnewman.
