The banks\u2019 wealthiest clients had access to a personalized application process that ensured their applications were processed first. Other applicants had to use poor-performing electronic portals, faced significant processing delays, and sometimes needed to find another lender to consider their application,\u201d wrote the lawmakers.The House established the special panel to oversee coronavirus relief measures, including the roughly $2 trillion CARES Act, and make sure taxpayer dollars are being spent efficiently. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tapped Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D-SC) to lead the subcommittee.A page from the PPP loan application that people have to fill out for financial support due to the continuing outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is pictured on a desk in New York U.S., May 7, 2020. REUTERS/Lucas JacksonThe Democratic members are asking the banks to provide documents and information, including guidance from SBA and Treasury regarding PPP requirements, internal communication and communication with SBA and Treasury about the prioritization or exclusion of applicants and internal policies and training materials regarding procedures for processing or expediting PPP loans.The lawmakers also want a list of all the PPP applications each bank received and details on how the institutions made sure loans went to underserved and rural markets. The panel is asking banks to turn over the information and brief Congressional staff by June 29.Story continuesRep. Steve Scalise (R-LA), the top Republican on the subcommittee, accused the Democratic members of trying to hurt President Trump during an election year.\u201cWe already know that financial institutions were able to process applications from existing clients more quickly because of requirements to vet new clients under existing law. In fact, the banking industry warned Congress this would happen before the PPP even started processing applications,\u201d said Scalise in a statement.\u201cThe indisputable fact is that PPP is working for American businesses,\u201d he added.In a statement to Yahoo Finance, Truist said its PPP applications \u201cwere handled through a single application portal made available to clients on a first-come, first access basis, without any preference given to larger or more affluent clients.\u201dTruist said will provide the information to lawmakers \u2014and noted 92% of its PPP loans went to companies with fewer than 50 employees.Wells Fargo (WFC) told Yahoo Finance as of May 31, 80% of its loans went to companies with fewer than 10 employees and more than half of the loans were for $25,000 or less.\u201cWells Fargo continues to work as quickly as possible to prepare and submit Paycheck Protection Program applications from our small business customers to the U.S. Small Business Administration,\u201d said a Wells Fargo spokesperson in an email.In the letter to Mnuchin and Carranza, the lawmakers also urged the administration to release the names of all PPP borrowers.\u201cContrary to Secretary Mnuchin\u2019s recent testimony, there is nothing \u2018proprietary\u2019 or \u2018confidential\u2019 about a business receiving millions of dollars appropriated by Congress, and taxpayers deserve to know how their money is being spent,\u201d the lawmakers wrote.In a Congressional hearing last week, Mnuchin signaled he would not release the names \u2014 though in a tweet on Monday he said he would be talking to the Senate Small Business Committee and others to \u201cstrike the appropriate balance for proper oversight of #ppploans and appropriate protection of small business information.\u201dJessica Smith is a reporter for Yahoo Finance based in Washington, D.C.
