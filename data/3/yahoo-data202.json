So we are really, at this point, running all our sheet machines at full capacity\u2026 around the clock.\u201dPupils sitting behind partition boards made of plexiglass attend a class at a primary school, during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, in Den Bosch, Netherlands, May 8, 2020.

That would be a lot of places such as classrooms, hallways, offices, book stores, and reception areas.Plaskolite, an Ohio-based company, has 10 factories across the country and is currently facing a 30-week backlog.\u201cOur lead times are extended substantially, partly because of our other conditional customers \u2014 as they come back online, we need to be able to serve them as well, and not throw the baby out with the bath water,\u201d said Schroeder, the Plaskolite CEO.Some of the orders placed by schools include requests for plexiglass sheets placed on mounts so that they can be rearranged if needed, as well as custom-made sheets to be placed inside a school bus.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen more demand and interest from K-12 [schools],\u201d Schroeder said, adding that there\u2019s been a mix of orders from both private and public schools from New York to Los Angeles.\u201cIt has been straight across the country\u2026 [but with] certainty more interest win urban environments,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a lot of work going into\u2026 having kids that go back to school in the fall.\u201dThe cost of these sheets varies according to the products \u2014 whether the customer is ordering acrylic or polycarbonate. A pound of either could run from $4 to $6.(PHOTO: PLASKOLITE)Acrylic is generally a stronger product that doesn\u2019t crack or break easily, Plaskolite noted, and estimates that the cost of a typical 4\u2019 by 8\u2019 sheet with 1/4\u201d plastic weighs around 40 pounds.Schroeder said that the average size ordered was around 2,500 sheets. If a school ordered 2,500 sheets, that\u2019d be roughly $100,000.Staff install a Plexiglass pane on the teacher's table during preparations for reopening the temporarily-closed Schloss-Schule elementary school on April 21, 2020 in Heppenheim, Germany.
