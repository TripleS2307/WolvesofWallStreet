Matt James, the best friend of \u201cBachelorette\u201d fan favorite Tyler Cameron, received the coveted gig after originally being cast as a contestant in Clare Crawley\u2019s upcoming season (Crawley\u2019s season has since been postponed due to the coronavirus.)Prior to the announcement, an online petition, which called for more diversity in the franchise, quickly circulated on social media, garnering over 85,000 signatures as of June 12th.In over 40 seasons of both \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d and its sister series \u201cThe Bachelorette,\u201d the only other person of color to be cast in the lead role was Rachel Lindsay. She took over the Bachelorette title in 2017.Matt James is the new Bachelor! For the first time in the franchise's 18-year history, the longtime reality TV dating show has a black leading man.Another major move this week included the cancellation of long-time reality TV show \u201cCops\u201d (VIAC), along with A&E\u2019s \u201cLive PD\u201d after the network pulled episodes off the air last week.The 33rd season of \u201cCops\u201d was originally scheduled to premiere on Monday, but no episodes had aired since June 1st amid the protests \u2014 fueling further questions about how law enforcement is depicted in pop culture.In a similar vein, streamer HBO Max (T) decided to remove the 1939 Civil War epic \u201cGone with the Wind\u201d from its content library, following mounting scrutiny over its portrayal of black people and slavery.Prior to the film\u2019s removal, \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d screenwriter John Ridley published a passionate op-ed in the L.A. Times that hit out at the classic for glorifying the antebellum South, and \u201cpauses only to perpetuate some of the most painful stereotypes of people of color.\u201dGone With The Wind, poster, left from left: Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh on 1950s.

Others have argued the steps are necessary to help further the objectives of racial reconciliation.Meanwhile, popular country music group Lady Antebellum formally changed its band name as a result of ongoing civil unrest \u2014 dropping the \u2018Antebellum\u2019 portion of their name entirely.Popular country group Lady Antebellum formally changed its band name as a result of ongoing civil unrestHowever, the group \u2014 who said they will now go by \u2018Lady A\u2019 \u2014 is now facing backlash after Seattle blues singer Anita White said she\u2019s been operating under the stage name \u2018Lady A\u2019 for the past 20 years.Oscars, Grammys also make changesThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is taking steps to becoming more culturally inclusive.\u201cSelma\u201d director Ava Duvernay \u2014 a longtime advocate of black filmmakers and people of color \u2014 was one of six new faces to be elected to the Academy\u2019s Board of Governors, which hit historic milestones this week for both women and people of color.The 54-person board now includes 26 women and 12 people of color \u2014 up from 25 and 11, respectively.The Academy\u2019s Board of Governors hit historic milestones this week for both women and people of color.The industry\u2019s actions come at a time when major players have been strongly criticized for lack of diversity and representation.For example, the only person of color to be nominated for an Academy Award this past Oscar season was Cynthia Erivo for her role as Harriet Tubman. This comes despite the Academy revamping its membership guidelines in order to attract more diverse voters following the #OscarsSoWhite controversies back in 2015 and 2016.Ironically, Duvernay and her film were at the center of those controversies, after the movie did not receive nominations for Best Director or Best Actor.\u201cSelma\u201d director Ava Duvernay was one of six new faces to be elected to the Academy\u2019s Board of GovernorsMeanwhile, another popular award show \u2014 the Grammys \u2014 will be renaming its controversial \u2018urban\u2019 category in an effort to advance a \u201ccompletely new, and very transparent and transformed Recording Academy,\u201d interim president and CEO Harvey Mason Jr. told Variety.The category, which will be renamed to \u2018Best Progressive R&B Album,\u2019 had previously been criticized by rapper Tyler the Creator, who said the use of the word was a way for the Academy to avoid including black artists in other categories and genres.Alexandra is a Producer & Entertainment Correspondent at Yahoo Finance.
