Now that relief is set to expire this week, the near future for the industry is little improved, and now its workers are desperate for another $25 billion in government help.Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, and American Airlines all have plans to lay off or furlough tens of thousands of airline employees this week if Congress doesn\u2019t agree on another relief package.Air travel has yet to return to even half of the pre-pandemic daily levels, and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) in July pushed back its target to 2024 for when air travel will return to pre-pandemic levels.Much has been made about whether Americans are ready to travel again and feel safe doing so, but industry representatives say the issue isn\u2019t passenger comfort level or pleasure travel: it\u2019s the dearth of business travel. (Business passengers typically comprise 75% of airline profits.)Over the Labor Day weekend, airlines on average saw 50% passenger capacity from one year prior, which was actually an improvement over the past few months. But they only saw 25% of the revenue from one year prior, due to blocked-off seats, slashed ticket prices, and lack of business travelers.\u201cEven as leisure travel might pick up a little bit, we don\u2019t see that business travel,\u201d says Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t see that business travel because people don\u2019t have a place to go to, these businesses have canceled all of their conventions. I have to tell you, I think that is more the issue than the safety issue. It\u2019s really more about the demand because of the other impacts of coronavirus and people not having those business meetings, not having something to go to: to a casino, to restaurants, to a resort. All of those things are going to have to return for the airline industry to return.\u201dUNITED STATES - SEPTEMBER 9: The Association of Flight Attendants and fellow aviation workers protest outside the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, Sept. 9, 2020. The flight attendants urged Congress to pass a COVID-19 relief package and extend the Payroll Support Program. (Photo By Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)The hotel industry, which has also suffered severe layoffs and faces prolonged pain, is saying the same thing: lack of business travel is the real problem.Story continuesAccording to the American Hotel and Lodging Association (AHLA) at the end of August, 40% of U.S. hotel employees are still not working, the industry is down 4.3 million jobs since February, and 65% of U.S. hotels remain at or below 50% occupancy, which for many hotels is below their break-even point.\u201cThis summer, leisure travel was OK, it certainly wasn\u2019t great, nothing close to what last year was, but I think it was as good as we could have expected for leisure travel,\u201d says AHLA president Chip Nelson. \u201cThe problem is there\u2019s no business travel, and there\u2019s absolutely no meetings, conventions, and conferences. Because of that, we\u2019re looking at about three quarters of hoteliers saying if there\u2019s no additional fiscal stimulus from Congress, then they\u2019re going to have lay more people off.\u201dThe AHLA implemented an industrywide \u201cSafe Stay\u201d cleaning protocol to make travelers feel more comfortable, but business travelers don\u2019t have a business purpose to travel, which makes their comfort level irrelevant.Nelson adds that in cities like Orlando and Las Vegas, \u201cIf they don\u2019t get convention business, they can\u2019t survive. But it\u2019s not just places like that. Chicago, New York City, these are places that thrive on the convention business.\u201dAs companies continue to have employees work from home and convert in-person conferences to virtual events, airlines and hotels will continue to suffer, and both industries want more government aid. Of course, that is not without controversy, as there are a range of service industries (think: restaurants) that are also suffering, and view further aid to airlines as an unwarranted government bailout.\u2014Daniel Roberts is an editor-at-large at Yahoo Finance.
