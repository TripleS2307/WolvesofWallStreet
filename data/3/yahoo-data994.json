And what does it represent in the heart, minds and wallets of the customer? What\u2019s their real operating strategy. The magic of Macy\u2019s was a hollow claim, and the polaris strategy that they hatched during the pandemic, it doesn\u2019t have much there,\u201d Cohen, the former CEO of Sears Canada and long-term department store executive said on Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade.Cohen \u2014 now a professor at Columbia Business School \u2014said he isn\u2019t sure if Macy\u2019s (M) has a place in the future of retail. \u201cSo after they closed hundreds of stores and refocused their efforts, what exactly does it take to the marketplace? I don\u2019t have a good answer for that,\u201d Cohen added.A Macy\u2019s spokeswoman didn\u2019t return Yahoo Finance\u2019s request for comment on Cohen\u2019s statements.Cohen\u2019s comments are not completely out of left field, coming as Macy\u2019s stock has crashed 52% year-to-date as stores have closed amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Macy\u2019s was struggling mightily ahead of the health crisis despite an effort to modernize key departments and slash costs via vast store closures. Sources have suggested to Yahoo Finance that Macy\u2019s latest overhaul, where it would close 125 stores and layoff thousands \u2014 put in place in February by CEO Jeff Gennette \u2014has led to execution missteps across the organization.But ultimately the COVID-19 outbreak has thrust Macy\u2019s into a fresh state of tumult.Macy\u2019s first quarter sales plunged by about $2.5 billion versus a year ago. The company notched a $969 operating loss compared to a $203 million profit last year. New Macy\u2019s CFO Felicia Williams told investors at a conference earlier this month sales may not normalize until 2021 or even 2022.Photo by: John Nacion/STAR MAX/IPx 2020 5/18/20 A view of Macy's Department Store during the coronavirus pandemic on May 18, 2020 in New York City. COVID-19 has spread to most countries around the world, claiming over 316,000 lives with over 4.8 million infections reported. All Macy's stores in New Hampshire reopen.To shore up its finances and avoid a trip through bankruptcy like long-time rival J.C. Penney, Macy\u2019s said this month it has secured $4.5 billion in fresh financing. The financing will help Macy\u2019s fund operations, buy new inventory and repay debt coming due this year and next.Story continuesKeep in mind Macy\u2019s balance sheet was already in weak shape prior to the latest debt raise. The company ended the first quarter with a colossal $5.6 billion in debt, more than three times its cash balance.\u201cMacy\u2019s top-line profile remains constrained by declining brick-and-mortar sales across the bulk of its full-line stores, with increased promotions and growing digital sales pressuring gross margin. Larger picture and multi-year, discretionary dollars continue to shift toward convenience (Amazon) and Value (off-price), with lower visibility in the U.S. wholesale environment,\u201d JPMorgan retail analyst Matthew Boss wrote in a recent note to clients. Boss has a Sell rating on Macy\u2019s stock \u2014 he removed his price target (a rare move for a sell-side analyst) on April 8.Out of the 16 sell-side analysts that cover Macy\u2019s, six rate the stock a Sell, nine see it as a Hold and one rates it a Buy.Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
