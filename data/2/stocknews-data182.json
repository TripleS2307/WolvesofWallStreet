Out of the S&P 500 members, about 83% beat consensus ESP estimates in the second quarter, while only a handful of sectors actually benefited from the digital transformation and record-low interest rate environment. Despite economic challenges, a business model suited to the pandemic has enabled some companies to deliver robust financial performance, beating all expectations. Consensus estimates are important in gauging a company\u2019s future earnings potential. And this is typically an important determinant of a stock\u2019s price movement.
