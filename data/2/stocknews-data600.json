This is an important time for traders, investors, and analysts because they use this information to gauge whether a company\u2019s stock price is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued. Therefore, a stock\u2019s volatility often ensues after earnings are released. This has been a particularly interesting earnings season because of the coronavirus pandemic. Traders, investors, and analysts have been understandably concerned over the impact of Covid-19 on corporate financials. Most of the companies reporting have been adding their commentary and response plans about the crisis to their earnings release and adjusting their guidance. Though we are at the tail-end of earnings season, a number of large companies will be reporting this week. Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO), Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT), NetEase Inc.
