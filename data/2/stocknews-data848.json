Since then, it\u2019s been quite volatile \u2013 trending higher in April and May, and lower in June and July. As you can see in the chart below, there is a level of support (red) that has formed at $44: Chart of GMED provided by TradingView The $44 support level is also the \u201cneckline\u201d for this head and shoulder pattern. A head and shoulders pattern is a chart formation that technical analysts use to locate areas/prices at which increased momentum to the upside or downside should occur. In this case, the first shoulder (blue) in GMED was in April/May, the head was in May/June, and the second shoulder is now forming in July. If GMED breaks below the neckline/support level of $44, there is a good chance that we will see a breakdown in the stock. Therefore, a trader could short GMED under $44 and expect to see momentum to the downside. Have a good trading day! Good luck!
