If the neckline of this pattern is crossed, I expect QCOM to have a breakdown. QCOM develops and licenses wireless technology and designs chips for smartphones. It is one of the largest manufacturers of wireless chipset based on baseband technology. Due to the 5G rollout, the company is benefiting from investments made towards building a mobile licensing program. Take a look at the 1-year chart of QCOM below with added notations: 9 \"BUY THE DIP\" Growth Stocks For 2020 Chart of QCOM provided by TradingView Over the past two months, QCOM has created a major level of support at $110 (green). That line is also the \u201cneckline\u201d for the stock\u2019s head and shoulders (H&S) reversal pattern. Above the neckline you can see the H&S pattern (red) has been completed. Confirmation of the head and shoulders pattern would occur if QCOM were to break the neckline. Therefore a trader could enter a short on a break below $110 with the expectation of seeing the stock continue lower. Want to See My Favorite Stock Trades Today?
