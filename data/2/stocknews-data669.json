No\u2026my intention is not to brag. Rather, I want to focus on what went right with these investments in the hopes of helping us all find more big winners in the future. And the 2 Stocks Are\u2026 9 \"BUY THE DIP\" Growth Stocks For 2020Amazon bought @ $8.58 for a gain to date of 37,196%. Priceline (now Booking Holdings) bought @ $14.62 and up 11,439% in total. (Was looking much better before the Coronavirus clipped the wings of all travel stocks\u2026but still not too shabby) It looks so obvious now. But what\u2019s so funny is that back then these stocks were tumbling lower. Especially Amazon which many experts said would NEVER make a profit given the low margin business and competition from others. Oh how wrong they were! Let\u2019s dig in further to figure out what each has in common. Most obvious is that it was the early days of the internet and these were two pioneers of ecommerce. So riding a big wave of innovation is certainly are part of the winning equation. Another similarity is that they were the early leaders in their respective categories. And often that early market share lead tells you who will dominate in the long run with lesser players falling by the wayside. This is where investing legends like Lynch, Cramer and Buffett agree. Meaning to concentrate your investments in the top industry players because quality and excellence are business advantages that can stay with a firm for many, many years. Both AMZN and BKNG invested heavily in R&D to keep innovating. Sometimes that led to underwhelming quarterly earnings. But in the long run it kept them a step ahead of the competition. Amazon more so than Booking in this case. The last point that stands out is that I didn\u2019t buy them at peak valuations. I bought them after a big pullback. This is where growth and value combine to find the best long term winners. Where to Find the Next Big Winners? I would like to say it\u2019s easy\u2026but it\u2019s not. Meaning far too many investors believe that the solution is just to look for stocks enjoying the biggest year over year growth rates. However, academic research clearly shows that these are some of the least profitable stocks. Why? Too often the lofty expectations are not met and the stocks implode. What is required is in-depth research into these growth areas like 5G, Blockchain, Medical Cannabis, Internet of Things, Cancer Drugs etc. And on top of that is a disciplined approach to the stock picking as not to chase overpriced stocks that are the next big losers.
