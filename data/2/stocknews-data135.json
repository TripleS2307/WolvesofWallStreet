However, limited entertainment choices, stimulus check cash, and the brokerage industry going to zero commissions all helped bring newbie traders into the market. The conventional wisdom has always been that most individuals who engage in active day trading ultimately lose money \u2014 signs of a market top. And while that may prove true \u2014 we\u2019ve certainly seen activity similar to the dot.com days such as chat rooms, disregard for valuations, and irrational price moves \u2014 one still needs to recognize this is now part of the trading landscape and it can influence prices. For myself, I find the best way to deal with the new chat room phenomena such as Reddit and r/WallStreetbets, which have a preponderance of speculation in small-cap and penny stock names, is to simply avoid them in spite of their big price swing lure \u2014 which could theoretically deliver big profits. A recent example of just how nonsensical and irrational that part of the trading world has become is SPI Energy\u2019s recent movement. They\u2019re a Hong Kong-based company that hopped on the electric vehicle bandwagon by announcing Wednesday that it was opening a Silicon Valley EV subsidiary called EdisonFuture.

The stock surged from around $1 to a high of $42 (4,200%) before settling at $22. Equally absurd is that as it became evident that it was simply a press release, the stock continued to swing between $10 and $30 over the past two days. It doesn\u2019t matter if the company\u2019s prospects haven\u2019t changed, as it\u2019s now a trading sardine on people\u2019s radar. 7 \"SAFE HAVEN\" Dividend Stocks for Turbulent TimesBut, what\u2019s harder to ignore is that retail traders have become a force in mainstream names from \u201cApple (AAPL)\u201d to \u201cTesla (TSLA),\u201d especially with options activity. As I wrote two weeks ago, the aggregation of these small traders can largely influence the overall market. I believe that rampant call buying in a handful of tech names led to the late-August meltup and the subsequent unwind we\u2019re now experiencing. Small options trades (10 contracts or less) now account for 12% of total options volume \u2014 more than double from prior years. And large institutional traders are now taking notice and trying to figure out a way to profit from this activity. As a Bloomberg article explains, they\u2019re using big data-crunching programs to find an edge. Alternative data has been a buzzword for years, and demand has exploded in 2020.

They\u2019re also plugging data into programs to discover what amateur stock traders are doing, and jumping on board. For example, r/WallStreetbets has over 1.5 million users along with several influential aka unofficial moderators, that on any given day may target certain names and specific options, such as AAPL 110 calls, for followers to target as buys. The big options market-making firms, such as Citadel and Susquehanna, want this information because they\u2019ll be facilitating order flow and need to hedge, and also to use as newfound pockets for profiteering.

My personal trading style isn\u2019t focused on unusual trading activity or trying to jump on short term momentum. It\u2019s now a dynamic force in the trading landscape that one must be aware of. Even if it\u2019s just to avoid being run over. [Last Chance] PROFIT off this Exclusive $19 Trial Offer to the Options 360 Service!
