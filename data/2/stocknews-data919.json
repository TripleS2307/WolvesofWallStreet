REITs usually pay a majority of their earnings as dividends which could generate a steady income for shareholders. As this industry is highly dependent on debt, the ongoing low interest-rate environment has been helping participants channel the majority of revenues to the bottom line, as interest expenses are minimal. While the entire REIT sector should perform well, since there are no expectations of the Fed hiking rates anytime soon, the REITs Data Centers sector is particularly well-positioned to outperform. This group has soared during these troubled times as the Coronavirus outbreak has resulted in increased demand for data centers and falling interest rates. 7 \"SAFE HAVEN\" Dividend Stocks for Turbulent TimesJust like the majority of industries, REIT stocks as a whole declined during the initial phases of the pandemic.
