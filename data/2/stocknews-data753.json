As things began to reopen, leisure stocks rebounded. The Invesco Dynamic Leisure and Entertainment ETF (PEJ) is up 20% over the last three months, compared with the SPDR 500\u2019s (SPY) 15% gain. While many investors were right to be concerned with the growth prospects of many leisure stocks during the pandemic, a segment of the leisure sector has performed well. These stocks are part of solitary leisure, meaning you can enjoy yourself without taking part in traditional entertainment. For example, there are now more people adding pools in their backyards or going on boats than before the pandemic. 7 Best ETFs for the NEXT Bull MarketHere are four leisure stocks that are seeing gains during the pandemic: Pool Corporation (POOL) POOL is the world\u2019s largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies and equipment. The ongoing healthcare crisis did not affect POOL\u2019s business in the second quarter. POOL\u2019s net revenues rose 14% year-over-year to $1.28 billion in the quarter.

POOL\u2019s president and CEO said, \u201cThe second quarter of 2020 presented a unique opportunity for our business as families continued to search for safe, at-home leisure activities, which drove earlier pool openings and increased demand for a variety of products.\u201d As industry demand is expected to remain healthy, POOL\u2019s dominance in construction and remodeling should help it thrive in the upcoming quarters.
