While the stocks in the index have a long track record of outperformance, the overall index is underperforming the other major indexes \u2014 the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite \u2014 so far this year. The DJIA\u2019s almost flat year-to-date return compares to the Nasdaq Composite\u2019s 31.2% return and the S&P 500\u2019s 8.7% gain. The skyrocketing performance of some of the tech stocks have helped the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit record highs in August. But the DJIA components, primarily major industrial and financial stocks, haven\u2019t generated the same interest, as these industries have not capitalized on the pandemic as some of the major tech players. However, the DJIA has displayed a solid recovery since the market crash in mid-March and is close to showing a positive return year-to-date. If you want to benefit from the index\u2019s revival, there are a number of stocks to choose from based on fundamental strength. But given the predictions of continued market and economic uncertainties, it would be a good idea to consider stocks that offer solid dividend income along with strong fundamentals. If the index fails to continue its recovery, then dividend stocks can at least help you generate a steady income. Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ), Pfizer, Inc. (PFE), and 3M Company (MMM) are three high dividend-paying DJIA stocks with solid fundamentals. 9 \"BUY THE DIP\" Growth Stocks For 2020Verizon Communications Inc.
