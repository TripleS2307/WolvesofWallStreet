Economists still expect a significant contraction of the global economy this year which could translate into a further market correction over the near term. Moreover, with two months to go before the US presidential election, market volatility might increase. While investing in dividend stocks is a sound investment strategy, there are not too many options currently available. In the second-quarter of 2020, the number of companies cutting dividends increased 931% year-over-year to 639. So, stocks that are still able to pay dividends and are expected to sustain them due to their fundamental strength, could be good additions to your portfolio. Rio Tinto Group (RIO), CubeSmart (CUBE), Stag Industrial, Inc. (STAG), and B&G Foods, Inc. (BGS) are four such stocks that could be a steady source of income for you due to their exceptional dividend yields and ability to sustain dividend payments. 7 \"SAFE HAVEN\" Dividend Stocks for Turbulent TimesRio Tinto Group (RIO) RIO engages in finding, mining, and processing mineral resources worldwide; with iron ore being the dominant commodity.
