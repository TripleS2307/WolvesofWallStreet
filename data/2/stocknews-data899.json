The demand for petroleum products started decreasing in February 2020 due to the lockdown measures taken by major oil consuming countries and crude futures plummeted to record lows in April. However, oil prices recovered significantly in the quarter ended June, marking their best quarterly performance in the past three decades. And, according to a recent CNBC report, this dramatic recovery convinced Goldman Sachs (GS) analysts to expect global oil demand to return to pre-pandemic levels by 2022. While remote operations, shortened supply chains and regionalization of businesses will keep the demand low in 2020, the sector should start rebounding in 2021. The analysts at the US investment bank expect global oil demand to decline by 8% in 2020 but rebound 8% in 2021. 9 \"BUY THE DIP\" Growth Stocks For 2020Oil prices are oftentimes driven by geo-politics and global events but demand also plays an important role. According to the latest forecast of the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), WTI crude oil would trade at $45.70 per barrel and Brent crude oil would trade at $49.70 per barrel in 2021.
