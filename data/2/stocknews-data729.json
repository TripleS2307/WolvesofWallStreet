U.S. initial jobless claims increased for the first time since March, which raised worries that the rally may soon be coming to an end. Technology stocks were dragged down by Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), and other chipmakers. One good news piece last week was that Oxford University and AstraZeneca (AZN) announced that their joint vaccine candidate produced healthy levels of antibodies and T-Cells. In other positive news, some stocks soared during a week of mostly negative news. Four stocks, in particular, were up over 10%.
