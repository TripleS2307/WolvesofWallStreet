Volatility is back, and with it, some discounted stocks with generous yields that we can snag. We\u2019ll talk about big dividends up to 20% today. An S&P 500 index fund, as usual, won\u2019t pay you enough income to retire. You have to buy the pricey basket and hope it\u2019ll keep levitating higher. A purchase of the popular index today and you\u2019ll barely squeeze out $18,000 in dividends by this time next year. That\u2019s not much but it\u2019s downright lavish compared with the $6,700 you\u2019d eke out of a 10-year T-note. 9 \"BUY THE DIP\" Growth Stocks For 2020Fortunately, if you look in the right corners of the market, you can take a nest egg half that size and generate anywhere between $46,000 and $100,000 annually in cold, card cash. But you can\u2019t just blindly chase yields and hope for the best. Dividend cuts can cripple your retirement plans, as investors in the likes of Boeing (BA), Ford (F) and Marriott (MAR) experienced earlier this year. The good news is, stocks often provide some early warning signals. Let\u2019s look at how Wall Street tipped its hands before recent dividend cuts by BP (BP) and Wells Fargo (WFC). In BP\u2019s case, Wall Street kept failing to buy a massive dip in shares\u2014a move so noticeable I mentioned it in July. BP\u2019s Resurgence Fizzled Out While the Market Marched On The same goes for Wells Fargo, which kept trending flat to lower even as bank stocks slowly began to recover. No One Believed Wells Fargo Was Coming Off the Mat Let me introduce you to five simply breathtaking dividend payers delivering between 9.2% and 20% on current prices, spanning the gamut, from REITs to MLPs to even a \u201cdisgraced\u201d blue chip as we search for dividend diamonds in the rough. Preferred Apartment Communities (APTS) Dividend Yield: 11.1% Let\u2019s start with Preferred Apartment Communities (APTS)\u2014a real estate investment trust (REIT) that, just by looking at its name, you know has been knocked around by COVID-19. Preferred Apartment Communities boasts 101 properties in 15 states, primarily in the southeast U.S. It primarily invests in multifamily properties, but also Class A office buildings and grocery-anchored shopping centers. Eight of those properties are student housing, but the pandemic has thrown that real estate industry into question; APTS reportedly is near a deal to unload those properties on private equity firm TPG for $480 million. At current prices, APTS is yielding more than 11% \u2026 but investors are buying into a complicated story, for better and for worse. On the upside, the company is more operationally sound than you\u2019d think. While shares are off 50% in large part because of rent-collection fears early on during the coronavirus outbreak, more recent collection stats are more encouraging. The company reported Q2 recurring rental revenues of 99% for both its multi-housing and office portfolios, and 92% for its grocery-anchored retail. But the financial situation is murkier than that performance would indicate. The 11.1% yield is based on Preferred Apartment Communities\u2019 reduced dividend. Preferred Apartments\u2019 Price, Payout Go Hand in Hand APTS cut the payout by 33% in May, after it had raised it annually since initiating the payout in 2011. Yes, APTS had to adjust for a downturn in funds from operations (FFO), but it also needed to ensure it could keep paying dividends on its large lot of preferreds. During Q2, the REIT paid out $8.6 million in regular dividends \u2026 but $35.6 million in preferred distributions. The new, lower dividend is more sustainable while still attractive at double digits. And APTS will be a natural beneficiary of a more robust economic recovery. But it could be a slow, frustrating wait. Analysts expect even 2022 FFO will be 40% lower than what the REIT earned last year. Prospect Capital (PSEC) Dividend Yield: 14.4% Prospect Capital (PSEC) is a business development company (BDC) that provides capital for middle-market companies. It primarily deals in first- and second-lien senior loans and mezzanine debt, but it will also use equity. At the moment, PSEC\u2019s portfolio boasts 121 investments across 39 industries. So you\u2019re getting a diversified private-equity-esque investment\u2014one with a sky-high yield (paid monthly!) to boot. But that dividend comes with two important asterisks. BDCs are among the income world\u2019s heaviest hitters. This is one of just two asset classes averaging double-digit yields, so understand that while Prospect Capital\u2019s (PSEC) 14%-plus yield might seem other-worldly, it\u2019s merely considered above-average within its peer group. More importantly, PSEC\u2019s dividend is, to put it kindly, erratic. Prospect Capital Is Not Shy About Dividend Cuts Any potential buyer of PSEC has to know that the company has a history of aggressive dividends that the business hasn\u2019t been able to back up. So you need abundant proof that Prospect Capital is in the midst of a dependable upswing to feel comfortable in locking in this yield. PSEC simply isn\u2019t there yet. Second-quarter net interest income (NII) of 16 cents per share was down 16% both year-over-year and quarter-over-year, and its net asset value (NAV) per share, while up a couple percent from Q1 2020, is still off 9% from last year. Moreover, the BDC has paid out 100% of its NII in dividends, which is a troubling figure considering the firm\u2019s dividend history. Energy Transfer LP (ET) Distribution Yield: 20.0% Energy Transfer LP (ET) is one of America\u2019s larger midstream energy firms \u2013 a roughly $17 billion outfit that\u2019s responsible for some 90,000 miles of national energy infrastructure in 38 states. Last year, 30% of natural gas and crude oil that moved across the U.S. did so on the firm\u2019s pipelines. ET units, off 52% year-to-date, have given up much of what was a sizable rebound off the lows amid dwindling momentum in crude and natural gas prices. Energy Transfer, like other pipeline companies, doesn\u2019t make its money by selling oil at a certain price, but instead is a \u201ctoll taker\u201d that collects as resources make their way through its infrastructure. Nonetheless, ET and other master limited partnerships (MLPs) have suffered just like their exploration-and-production brethren given cripplingly low demand, which translates into less need for their services. So what comes next for demand? The Energy Information Administration is forecasting an 8.3 million barrel-per-day decline from 2019 to 93.1 million in 2020, but a 6.5 million b/d increase in 2021. But that estimate, made in September, is half a million barrels lower than it was in August. Translation: The more sluggish the country\u2019s economic recovery, the slower ET will return to normalcy. That would seem to mean trouble for Energy Transfer\u2019s wildly high distribution, but the MLP is grinding it out. The company has preserved cash by reducing its capital growth plans by 15%, to $3.4 billion, across two different cuts. The upshot? ET announced in July that it would keep its August payout level at 30.5 cents per unit, and that distributable cash flow (DCF, an important MLP metric that outlines cash that can be redistributed to unitholders) was 1.54x what it needed to cover the distribution. I can\u2019t recommend ET for investors looking for a reliable long-term source of income. Commodities are too volatile, MLPs are a tax headache, and what you gain in yield with ET, you lose in heartburn from the unit price whipping around and wondering whether the next oil crash will be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back. But short-term speculators might be able to make something out of this downtrodden energy play. ET Has Yielded ~20% Three Stints in the Past Four Years Exxon Mobil (XOM) Dividend Yield: 9.2% For the past few months, every time Exxon Mobil (XOM) has triggered one of my yield signals, I\u2019ve done a double-take. It\u2019s just nothing you would have imagined from what for so long was one of Wall Street\u2019s premier integrated energy majors. We\u2019re in Uncharted Territory Exxon has suffered through an excruciating year: Shares are off 46% in 2020. Exxon announced $33 billion in planned capital expenditures in March, only to turn around in April and reduce that figure by 30%. It lost $610 million in Q1, then $1.1 billion in Q2. Exxon kept the payout level in April; it traditionally raises its dividend during the month, so its status as a Dividend Aristocrat is in doubt. XOM, which had been a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average since 1928, was booted in August. The next domino to fall might be the dividend, which even Wall Street\u2019s analysts are discussing as a real possibility. Counterintuitively, a dividend cut could end up being a buy signal, as it\u2019s one of the best things Exxon could do for its long-term sustainability. XOM has failed to cover its dividend with free cash flow since 2019. Exxon has been moving heaven and earth to protect its payout, not just cutting capital expenditures, but nipping and tucking anywhere it can. XOM even went so far as to suspend 401(k) matches before touching the dividend. If oil prices continue to wallow, Exxon will have to keep borrowing to keep the payout intact. And believe it or not, that is an option, at least in the near-term. Exxon\u2019s leverage isn\u2019t as high as many of its global peers, so it could borrow to sustain the dividend until energy prices recover and keep one of its few remaining favored statuses. But doing so would dig an even larger hole for XOM to climb out of, and the longer it cuts back on capex, the more it\u2019s jeopardizing its future growth potential. Want More Great Investing Ideas?
