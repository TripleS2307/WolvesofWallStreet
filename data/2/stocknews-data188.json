The order allowed private sector entities to execute a commercial transaction, responsible for maintaining and operating the network. Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL), and Walmart (WMT) were potential bidders for TikTok\u2019s U.S. business. ORCL won the bid and it could take up to a 12.5% stake in TikTok\u2019s parent company. ORCL struck the deal as it is confident in its ability to deliver a highly secure environment to TikTok and ensure data privacy to TikTok\u2019s American users, and users throughout the world. Last Saturday, Trump approved the deal.
