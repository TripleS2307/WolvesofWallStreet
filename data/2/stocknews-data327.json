While analysts are yet to come to an agreement on whether this is an early sign of a market correction, the market is expected to remain highly volatile due to the upcoming election.

That along with the record-low interest rate environment is a strong reason why this could be an appropriate time for dividend investing. Global dividends are anticipated to have fallen 17% in the second quarter, the worst drop since 2009. More than 750 companies, including over 60 members of the S&P 500, have slashed or suspended their payouts due to the pandemic.
