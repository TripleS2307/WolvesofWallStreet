(PENN) is a diversified entertainment company that owns and operates several race tracks and casinos across the country. It recently expanded into sports media and betting by acquiring a 36% stake in Barstool digital media for $163 million in January 2020. Barstool\u2019s app was the #1 sports betting app in the Apple store following its launch, due to the app\u2019s ease of use and ubiquity of Barstool on social media. Currently just available in Pennsylvania, Barstool is soon expected to be available in all states. PENN has gained more than 130% since the app\u2019s launch, and more than 180% year-to-date. PENN is well-positioned to gain significantly in the upcoming months despite its impressive gains so far, with the kick-off of the NFL season and launch of Barstool Sportsbook. This, combined with several other factors, has helped the stock earn a \u201cBuy\u201d rating in our proprietary rating system. 7 Best ETFs for the NEXT Bull Market Here\u2019s how our proprietary POWR Ratings system evaluates PENN: Trade Grade: A PENN is currently trading above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages of $48.76 and $30.48 respectively, indicating a golden-cross bullishness. It has gained 118.1% in the past three months, which reflects a short-term uptrend in the stock. PENN recently entered into a strategic partnership with Sportsradar, which allows it to use official NFL data on its sports betting platforms. This allows the company to display real-time scores and in-game wagering options to 66 million barstool fans and 20 million casino customers. PENN has launched its debut Barstool Sportbook app in Pennsylvania on September 18th and plans to expand its reach across the country. Buy & Hold Grade: B In terms of proximity to the 52-week high, which is a key factor that our Buy & Hold Grade takes into account, PENN is well-positioned. It is currently trading just 9.3% below its 52-week high of $76.62. PENN has gained 210.6% in the past three years, which can be attributed to its solid revenue growth. Net revenue increased at a CAGR of 10.5% over the past three years, while total assets grew at a CAGR of 42.3% over the same period. PENN\u2019s impressive performance in the past few years was backed by surplus cash flows and a thriving economy, which increased the popularity of casinos and online sports.
