GDP contracted 32.9% in the April-June quarter, indicating the onset of a recession. With the health care crisis affecting the usual way businesses operate, the unemployment rate stood at 10.2% at the end of July 2020, according to the U.S. Bureau of labor Statistics. However, the stock market has continued to outperform the economy since the beginning of the pandemic, raising questions about the sustainability of this rally. Along with the concerns over the market\u2019s ability to keep moving higher when there is not significant improvement on the economic front yet, a low interest rate environment makes it reasonable to bet on stocks that pay high dividends.
