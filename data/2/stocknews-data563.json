ROIC is used to assess a company\u2019s efficiency at allocating capital to profitability. In other words, it measures how much profit a company can generate for every dollar invested in the company. The higher the figure, the more profit a company makes. ROIC is calculated by dividing net operating profit after taxes by invested capital. Investors can use ROIC to evaluate how attractive an industry is, or compare companies within an industry. Efficiency tells us how competitive the company is in its industry. For instance, if a company has a high ROIC, it most likely has an economic moat. An economic moat refers to a business\u2019 ability to sustain its competitive advantage. That means a company sells products that are not only liked by consumers but also in high demand. ROIC can also be used to evaluate corporate management. If a company has a high ROIC, it means management is doing an excellent job at allocating capital. A company is creating value as long as it\u2019s ROIC is higher than 2%. The 2% is the bare minimum, though. Levels above 10% are considered good, and over 15% reflect a company with a sustainable advantage. To find very strong companies, I limited my selection to stocks with an ROIC of over 20%. Here are four companies that fit the bill: Apple (AAPL), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Masco (MAS), and Lam Research (LRCX). 7 Best ETFs for the NEXT Bull MarketApple (AAPL) AAPL designs a wide variety of consumer electronic devices, but the iPhone makes up most of the company\u2019s total revenue. The company\u2019s portfolio also includes the App Store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, and wearable devices such as the Apple Watch and AirPods. AAPl currently has an ROIC of 29.4%. Its ROIC has, for the most part, stayed above 20% for the last 30 years. The company, which reported earnings last month, showed continued momentum in the services segment. This was driven by strong performance in the App Store, Apple Music, and video and cloud services. AAPL has more than 550 million paid subscribers across all of its services products. The iPhone also recovered due to strong demand for the iPhone SE in May and June. The company\u2019s wearable segment is expected to drive revenues through the end of 2020. On Monday, the company announced a 4-for-1 stock split, which will take effect on August 31. This will be Apple\u2019s fifth stock split since the company went public.

The drug is approved in the United States, EU, Japan, and more countries to treat neovascular age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema (DME), and macular edema. Due to aging trends in the U.S., this drug should continue to drive revenue for REGN. The company is also working on expanding the drug\u2019s label for other conditions. The company reported earnings last week with an EPS of $7.16 and revenue of $1.95 billion. These were both positive surprises over analyst estimates of $5.59 and $1.74 billion.
