From a complete lockdown to social distancing norms, reduced business operations have led to a $120 billion loss in sales in the first three months of the pandemic, according to the National Restaurant Association (NRA). However, in order to support the recovery of this sector, the NRA has requested low-interest loans and subsidies, as well as reduced taxes from central and state governments. This, combined with an efficient delivery system and drive-thru service, can help the industry recover from pandemic-led losses. However, fast food restaurants have fared well during this pandemic, as these food chains already have a well-established delivery and drive-thru system. Fast food consumption has relatively increased over the past couple of months, as people are substituting dining in restaurants with take away from fast food chains. As coronavirus is not food-borne, eating take-out has become popular across the country. Companies such as McDonald\u2019s Corporation (MCD), Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG), Domino\u2019s Pizza, Inc. (DPZ), and Dunkin\u2019 Brands Group, Inc. (DNKN) have generated profits in the last reported quarters, despite weakness in the industry. Many of them have also expanded their business by opening new franchise restaurants across the country and internationally. As the risk of catching the virus is increasing with each day, the popularity and thereby revenue and earnings of these companies are expected to increase over the upcoming months. 7 Best ETFs for the NEXT Bull MarketMcDonald\u2019s Corporation (MCD) MCD is one of the most popular fast-food joints in the world, operating through the following segments \u2014 United States, International Lead markets, High Growth markets, foundational markets, and corporate.
