This is an opportune time to learn more about how a company performed over the previous quarter. The number of positive earnings surprises outnumbered the number of negative earnings surprises on both Monday and Tuesday. That is a positive sign in light of the coronavirus pandemic and challenging economic environment. There were quite a few earnings, in particular, yesterday that just blew away earnings estimates, percentage-wise. Some of these stocks are rated at least a Buy in our POWR Ratings system. Four in particular caught my eye. All four of these stocks posted an earnings surprise of 80% or more. Here are the four best earnings surprises from yesterday. 7 \"SAFE HAVEN\" Dividend Stocks for Turbulent TimesiRobot (IRBT) IRBT is a US-based consumer robot company. It designs and builds robots that assist consumers with activities that can be carried out both inside and outside the home. This can include cleaning, mapping and navigation, and human-robot interaction solutions. IRBT\u2019s most well-known products are the Roomba and Braava house-cleaning devices. The company derives its revenue primarily from its product sales. The company posted earnings of $1.06, which was a 268% surprise over the average estimate of $0.29. IRBT also saw revenue increase 8% year over year to $279.9 million for the quarter. The company\u2019s robots, including Roomba i7 Series and s9 Series and Braava Jet M Series, saw 43% sales growth. The company has been able to boost demand and sales through television ad campaigns. Despite this impressive earnings beat, the stock is trading down today on news that its Roomba autonomous vacuums could be hit with trade tariffs in the second half of 2020. IRBT is rated a Buy by our momentum-based POWR Ratings system. It holds grades of A in Trade Grade and Industry Rank and B for Buy & Hold Grade and Peer Grade. The company is the #23 ranked company in the Home Improvement & Goods industry. Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) ISRG develops, produces, and markets a robotic system, called the da Vinci surgical system to assist minimally invasive surgery. The system reduces the trauma associated with open surgery. The company has sold more than 5,500 da Vinci systems to hospitals worldwide.

The company posted earnings of $1.11 per share, which was a surprise of 97.86% over the average analyst estimate of $0.56. Earnings were driven by better than expected procedure volume and system placements. ISRG saw revenue for the quarter of $852 million. While these figures beat analysts\u2019 expectations, they were well below their figures last year as sales fell 22% year over year due to the pandemic affecting elective procedures. The stock is trading up almost 4% today on the news of this strong quarter. ISRG has a strong report card of four As and 1 B. By that, I mean that four scores of our POWR Ratings system are an A for the stock, and one is a B. The company is also the #1 ranked stock in the Medical \u2013 Devices & Equipment industry.
