However, it also created an opportunity for companies that offer entertainment to people from the comfort of their couch. Companies involved in streaming online video content or producing video games have actually grown in the past 5-months despite the challenging economic environment that exists. One way to find companies outperforming the market is to compare performance to a market benchmark such as the S&P 500. Netflix Inc. (NFLX), NetEase Inc. (NTES), and Gravity Co Ltd (GRVY) are three companies outperforming the S&P 500 so far for the year. 7 \"SAFE HAVEN\" Dividend Stocks for Turbulent TimesNetflix Inc.

The company added 10.1 million paid memberships in the quarter as compared to 2.7 million a year ago. Although growth has slowed down after economies around the world reopened, NFLX\u2019s ability to churn out exciting content verticals could result in positive customer sentiment. The streaming powerhouse recently secured 160 Emmy nominations, which is a tally for the history books. According to our POWR Ratings system, NFLX has an \u201cA\u201d in Industry Rank and a \u201cB\u201d in Trade Grade. It ranks #24 out of 54 stocks in the Internet group. NetEase Inc.
