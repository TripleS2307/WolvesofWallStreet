Several stocks have been upgraded to \u201cBuy\u201d or \u201cStrong Buy\u201d ratings. Our POWR Ratings system is an exclusive momentum-based stock-rating system that grades stocks based on several metrics. Though the stock market has been quite unpredictable of late, this is not a time to go all-cash and wait until another correction occurs. Instead, this is an opportune time to pick up shares of quality companies. Below, I look at four stocks recently upgraded to an \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d rating by our POWR Ratings system: Check Point Software (CHKP), Paylocity(PCTY), Sibanye Stillwater Limited (SBSW), and Herbalife Nutrition (HLF). In other words, they are \u201cStrong Buys\u201d or \u201cBuys.\u201d 7 Best ETFs for the NEXT Bull MarketCheck Point Software (CHKP) CHKP offerings include IT, software, and computer hardware services and products. The company\u2019s initial product, the FireWall-1, was designed with groundbreaking inspection technology, setting the stage for additional offerings to an ever-growing client base. In short, CHKP bolsters IT security with network and data protection tools. These services are becoming even more critical as employees work remotely due to the spread of COVID-19. The POWR Ratings show CHKP has \u201cA\u201d grades in each component, but its Industry Rank. CHKP is ranked first out of 23 stocks in the Software \u2013 Security industry. CHKP has a three-month price return of 12%, a six-month price return of 35%, and a five-year price return of 52%. Analysts have set a price target of $126.72 for the stock. CHKP has a fairly low forward P/E ratio of 18.59, considering it is an emerging force in the high-tech space. CHKP executives are shrewdly transitioning to a subscription-based service. The company raked in nearly $160 million from security subscriptions this past quarter, representing a 10% increase on a year-over-year basis. CHKP\u2019s subscription service is likely to prove even more successful in the long-run as more companies shift to the cloud in response to the pandemic. Paylocity (PCTY) Cloud-based payroll services and software solutions are gaining more momentum as the pandemic plays out. PCTY provides such solutions, primarily for medium-sized businesses. All in all, PCTY served 20,000 clients in 2019. PCTY\u2019s overarching goal is to facilitate strategic decision-making, boost human resource efficiency, and make a meaningful impact on clients\u2019 bottom lines. The POWR Ratings show PCTY has \u201cA\u201d grades in each POWR component, but its Industry Rank, which has a grade of \u201cB.\u201d The company is rated a \u2018Buy\u201d in the POWR Ratings system. PCTY is ranked 6th of more than 90 stocks in the Software \u2013 Application industry. Furthermore, PCTY has returned 79% over six months, 53% across the past year, and an incredible 215% over three years. Out of the nine analysts who have studied PCTY, five recommend buying the stock, and four recommend holding. PCTY has moved right back up to its pre-COVID trading price of $150, following a drop down to $70. PCTY recurring/other revenue boomed 25% on a year-over-year basis. The company anticipates sales will grow by about 20% on a year-over-year basis. Sibanye Stillwater Limited (SBSW) A considerable sum of money has moved into precious metals mining companies as the economy entered a deep trough. SBSW is one such company. SBSW has an expansive portfolio of gold and platinum operations and projects. The company is rated a \u201cBuy\u201d by our POWR Ratings system. SBSW has \u201cA\u201d grades in the Trade Grade and Peer Grade components and a \u201cB\u201d Buy & Hold Grade. The company is ranked first out of 16 publicly traded companies in the Miners \u2013 Diversified industry. SBSW has a three-month price return of 63%, a six-month price return of 241%, and a year-to-date return of 26%. It appears as though SBSW is undervalued as its forward P/E ratio is a mere 6.1. Herbalife Nutrition (HLF) It was not long ago when investors shunned HLF as a supposed pyramid scheme. However, HLF products are proving quite successful, and the stock is moving upward. HLF\u2019s health-oriented offerings will prove even more popular in the aftermath of the lengthy quarantine in which most people added a few pounds. The company is rated a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d by our POWR Ratings system. HLF has \u201cA\u201d grades in the Trade Grade and Buy & Hold Grade POWR components, a \u201cB\u201d Peer Grade, and a #1 ranking out of 14 stocks in the Medical \u2013 Consumer Goods industry. HLF has a three-month price return of 12%, a six-month price return of 76%, and a five-year price return of 75%. Analysts have set a price target of $62.25, which means they believe the stock has more room to grow. If HLF reaches $62, it will have spiked by more than 25%. The stock has a forward P/E ratio of 14, litigation woes in the rear view mirror, and plenty of buzz surrounding its health products.
