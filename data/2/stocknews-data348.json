As Labor Day week looms, some seasonal quantitative data suggests retail stock Under Armor Inc (NYSE:UAA) might be worth a closer look. Earlier this week, we profiled the 25 best stocks to own during Labor Day week. Yesterday, we narrowed the focus to look at the 25 best-performing stocks on the S&P 500 during Labor Day week. Stocks had to have at least eight years\u2019 worth of returns to make the list, which was cultivated by Schaeffer\u2019s Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White. Under Armour stock has generated the third healthiest average returns, at 2.8%, and has ended the week higher 80% of the time. It\u2019s also worth noting that UAA is the only stock in the personal goods sector to show up on the list. The athleisure retailer has taken a 50% haircut in 2020, but has managed to tack on 10% this quarter. A move higher and of similar magnitude would have Under Armour stock knocking on the door of the $11 level for the first time in three weeks. Since early July, UAA\u2019s 80-day moving average has emerged as a floor, an area that coincides with the round $10 level. 7 Best ETFs for the NEXT Bull Market A short squeeze could keep the wind at the equity\u2019s back. Short interest fell by 18.5% in the two most recent reporting periods. However, the 19.18 million shares sold short still account for a healthy 10.2% of UAA\u2019s total available float. The options pits are predominantly focused on calls, despite limited absolute volume. In the past 10 days, 4,717 calls have exchanged hands on the International Securities Exchange (ISE), Cboe Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX), compared to just 401 puts. The resultant call/put volume ratio of 11.76 sits two percentage points from an annual high, suggesting a healthier-than-usual appetite for bullish bets of late. Call options are certainly an intriguing route, considering the implied volatilities call options are near parity with their put counterparts. This is per Under Armour\u2019s 30-day implied volatility (IV) skew of 2.3%, which registers in the low 13th percentile of its 12-month range. Keeping track of the week\u2019s stock market activity is no easy feat.
