Imagine what a 9.5% dividend could mean. Take a $300,000 portfolio and you\u2019ve suddenly got $2,375 in passive monthly income. A million bucks? You\u2019re talking about almost $8,000 a month\u2014miles ahead of the $1,500 a month you\u2019d get if you just put it in an S&P 500 index fund. Here\u2019s the kicker: the investments in this five-fund portfolio, all closed-end funds (CEFs), invest in the same companies that make up the S&P 500. 9 \"BUY THE DIP\" Growth Stocks For 2020CEFs: Your Ticket to \u201cSleep Well at Night\u201d 7%+ Dividends CEFs have been around for over a century, and they work a bit like a mutual fund or ETF, with two big exceptions. One is that, as the name says, they\u2019re closed, so when the fund issues shares for the first time, that\u2019s pretty much it; new shares aren\u2019t issued to new investors. Instead, you can only buy shares from previous investors. This means your ownership of the assets within the fund is locked in; there\u2019s no dilution, and there\u2019s much less volatility than you get with some other high-yield assets, like business development companies (BDCs) or mortgage REITs. CEF prices tend to trend in a straighter line, with less volatility. That\u2019s not even the best part. This is: CEFs take conventional assets\u2014think blue-chip stocks like Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT)\u2014and make them big yielders. They do this because fund managers are constantly buying and selling assets in their large (sometimes multi-billion-dollar) portfolios, and as one asset is sold for a profit, they can use some of those profits to buy something else and put money aside in the form of dividends to shareholders. This strategy is sustainable. As I mentioned, some CEFs have been around for nearly a century, and many of the younger ones have seen their portfolios grow in recent years, pointing to a bright future. 5 CEFs Primed for Big Yields (and Upside) Now let\u2019s get into it\u2014how can you use CEFs to build a diversified portfolio with big, sustainable dividends? Take a look at the table below. Symbol Name Asset Class Yield on Price Long-Term CAGR NAV Minus Market Price, YTD GAB Gabelli Equity Trust US Stocks 12.0% 12.2% -0.9% ASG Liberty All-Star Growth US Stocks 7.3% 15.6% -2.3% PTY PIMCO Corporate & Income Opportunities Corporate Bonds 10.2% 10.8% 2.8% JRS Nuveen Real Estate Income US Real Estate 9.8% 7.5% 5.8% GUT Gabelli Utility Trust Utilities 8.0% 9.1% -15.7% These five CEFs come from different fund managers and have different strategies, so we get exposure to utilities, US stocks, real estate and corporate bonds. An equal investment in each of these funds gets us to that 9.5% average yield. Put these together and you\u2019ve got a great variety of high-quality assets. GAB looks for hidden value, so it holds stocks like Rollins (ROL), Mastercard (MA) and Honeywell (HON); ASG\u2019s focus on big-cap growth gives you Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOG), Autodesk (ADSK), Chegg (CHGG) and Illumina (ILMN). Meanwhile, PTY will get you a variety of corporate bonds from S&P 500 companies and beyond; JRS makes you the landlord (without the work!) of hundreds of offices, apartment buildings and other properties around the country; and GUT gives you a piece of the utility companies people depend on\u2014and will continue to, crisis or no. Growing Your Wealth and Your Income This portfolio does more than that, too. Because these funds are all top performers, averaging 11% annualized returns over the long term and either matching or beating their index, they\u2019ll grow your investment to stratospheric heights. A Few Years to a Million If you put just $300,000 in these funds and reinvest your dividends, you\u2019d have a million dollars a little more than a decade later and over $2 million in 20 years. Throw an extra $1,500 per month into this portfolio over a 20-year timeframe and you\u2019d have over $3 million while getting to seven figures even sooner. Little Investment for a Big Reward That\u2019s a pretty small amount to put away in a short period of time! But at the end you\u2019d have a portfolio that yields a whopping $25,479 per month.
