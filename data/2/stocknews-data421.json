However, economic data shows this is not the case. Industrial production is bouncing back, and even more so in Asian and European countries that are ahead of the US in curbing the virus. We can also see this in how oil demand has dropped less than expected. Additionally, industries that are connected to the industrial sector like trucking and rails are near 52-week highs. Dow Theory tells us that this is a harbinger of strength in industrial stocks. U.S. Industrial production has been showing signs of improvement in the past three months. Industrial production plunged 12.5% in April but eventually recovered the lost ground with gains of 1.4%, 5.7%, and 3% in May, June, and July, respectively. The recovery is also evident from the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund\u2019s (XLI) 17.7% gain in the past three months. 7 Best ETFs for the NEXT Bull MarketPlug Power Inc.
