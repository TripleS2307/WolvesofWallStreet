However, over the years, the number of smokers seems to be declining with new generations becoming more health conscious. Consequently, the industry has been evolving by selling new-age products \u2014 such as IQOS, e-vapor, smokeless tobacco and nicotine pouches \u2014 which are alternatives to cigarettes and have less health risks. And these new-age products that tobacco companies are adding to their portfolio, have been gaining popularity among customers, helping the companies stay afloat. Moreover, some of the tobacco stocks pay generous dividends which help them draw significant attention from income investors. Philip Morris International Inc. (PM) and Altria Group, Inc.

(PM) The FDA authorized the marketing of IQOS, which is PM\u2019s electrically heated tobacco system, as a Modified Risk Tobacco Product in July.

PM has gained about 39.5% since it hit its 52-week low of $56.01 in March.

(MO) On the FDA authorization of IQOS tobacco heating system, CEO of MO Billy Gifford said, \u201cWe\u2019re delighted that the FDA authorized IQOS to be marketed as a modified-risk tobacco product. This authorization gives PM USA an opportunity to communicate additional benefits of switching to IQOS and this decision is an important step for adult smokers. Our 10-year vision is to responsibly lead the transition of adult smokers to a non-combustible future. IQOS is a key part of that future as we develop our portfolio of FDA-authorized, non-combustible products and actively switch adult smokers to them.\u201d On July 27th 2020, MO declared a dividend of $0.86 per share indicating a new annual dividend of $3.44 per share, which indicates a 2.4% increase from its previous annualized dividend.
