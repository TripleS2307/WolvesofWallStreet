This is evident from the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF\u2019s (XLK) 67.3% return since its March low, compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 52.8% gain. With the uncertainty surrounding the upcoming presidential election, fiscal stimulus talks, and continued increase in coronavirus cases, the market is expected to remain quite volatile this month. Moreover, on October 6th, the House Antitrust Subcommittee issued a report, mentioning the wrongdoing and anticompetitive behavior of Facebook (FB) Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL) in detail. The report is demanding action to change antitrust laws. However, the report failed to lower investor enthusiasm for tech companies. Keeping that in mind, investment in strong technology companies such as Twitter, Inc. (TWTR), Spotify Technology S.A. Ordinary (SPOT), Twilio Inc. (TWLO), Pinterest, Inc. (PINS) and GrubHub Inc. (GRUB) could add a boost to your portfolio amid the pandemic. 9 \"BUY THE DIP\" Growth Stocks For 2020Twitter, Inc. (TWTR) In recent years, if news triggered billions dollar moves in the stock market, it likely came from the little blue bird. I am talking about TWTR, which operates as a platform for public self-expression and real time conversation in the United States and internationally. It has become even easier to follow a particular stock on Twitter. Although a free platform for the users, its major sources of revenues are advertising and data licensing. For the fiscal quarter that ended June 30, 2020, the Average Monetizable Daily Active Usage (mDAU) for TWTR grew 34% year-over-year to $186 million. The company\u2019s EPS is expected to increase 184% next year. Also, the market expects TWTR\u2019s revenue to increase 2.4% next quarter and 23.7% in the next year. The stock has gained 107.2% since hitting its low of $20 in mid-March. TWTR is exploring options on how to make the platform better and how misinformation labels can be more direct and obvious. TWTR should exhibit strength as it nears its next earnings release for the quarter that ended on September 30, 2020. How does TWTR stack up for the POWR Ratings? A for Trade Grade A for Buy & Hold Grade A for Peer Grade B for Industry Rank A for Overall POWR Rating The stock is also ranked #3 out of 57 stocks in the Internet industry. Spotify Technology S.A. Ordinary Shares (SPOT) Founded in 2006, SPOT provides audio streaming services in the United States, the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, and internationally.

For the quarter that ended June 30, 2020, SPOT\u2019s total revenue grew 13% year-over-year, while its premium revenue grew 17% year-over-year. Unlike its competitors, it only monetizes profits from its audio streaming services. At the end of the second quarter, SPOT boasted a monthly active user base of 299 million, which grew 29% year-over-year. It has the highest subscribers in Europe at 39%, followed by North America at 29%. The stock gained 111.3% since hitting its 52-week low in mid-March.

(PINS) With a pinboard-style photo-sharing website operation, PINS is a visual discovery engine for finding ideas like recipes, home and style inspiration, and more. Found in 2008, it went public in April 2019. Before PINS came into being, CEO Ben Silbermann had ventured into transforming every cell phone into a clothing retail outlet with an app called Tote, which was launched by 2010. However, the technology of that time limited its growth and eventually, PINS came into existence and quite successfully so. For the quarter that ended June 30, 2020, PINS reported Global Monthly Active Users of 416 million, which grew 39% year-over-year. The company\u2019s revenue grew 4% year-over-year to $272 million. The stock has gained 297% since hitting its 52-week low of $10.10 in mid-March. PINS\u2019 EPS is expected to increase 100% in the current quarter, 633.3% next year, and at a rate of 139% over the next five years. The market expects PIN\u2019s revenue to increase 34.6% in the current quarter, 26.9% in the current financial year, and 34.5% next year. In fact, PINS\u2019 earnings surprise history looks impressive with the company missing the consensus estimate in just one of the trailing four quarters. PINS\u2019s strong fundamentals are reflected in its POWR Ratings. It has a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating with an \u201cA\u201d in Trade Grade, Peer Grade, Buy & Hold Grade, and \u201cB\u201d in Industry Rank. GrubHub Inc.
