There are several indicators of ongoing weakness in the economy, such as rising unemployment, weaker manufacturing data, subdued consumer confidence, and a weakness in the US dollar as compared to other currencies. Making investment decisions during a recession can be head-scratching and counterintuitive, however, they may prove to be rewarding as well. Companies that are resilient during a recession most likely perform better than the rest of the market when the economy starts recovering. Usually, companies providing essential products or services with an inelastic demand are considered recession proof. Consumers buy products and services that these companies offer even if they are forced to reduce their discretionary spending. So, it can be a good idea to invest in certain \u201crecession-proof\u201d stocks to provide some capital appreciation, or at the very least help protect your net worth during these uncertain times. 9 \"BUY THE DIP\" Growth Stocks For 2020Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), 3M Company (MMM), and Dollar General Corporation (DG) have performed well so far this year and are well positioned to show strength even if the recession deepens.
