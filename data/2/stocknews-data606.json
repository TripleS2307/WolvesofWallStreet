They have created significant wealth over the years and a few such stocks as Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) have touched trillion-dollar valuations as well. Even during the ongoing pandemic tech stocks have continued to soar higher, touching record highs and are largely immune to the current recessionary environment. Another stock that has generated market-beating returns is China\u2019s technology heavyweight Alibaba (BABA). The company went public back in November 2014 and has since returned over 170% to investors. In comparison, broader indexes such as the S&P 500 and Dow Jones have gained 68% and 61% respectively since Alibaba\u2019s IPO. BABA stock is currently valued at a market cap of $682 billion and might very well be the next trillion-dollar company on the New York Stock Exchange. Alibaba is currently the six largest publicly listed company in the U.S., trailing social media giant Facebook which is valued at $765 billion. 7 Best ETFs for the NEXT Bull MarketSo why am I bullish on BABA stock and why do I think it can continue to generate outsized gains in 2020 and beyond?

The AliExpress platform is available in 17 other languages. 1688.com: Analysys forecasts 1688.com to be China\u2019s leading integrated domestic wholesale marketplace by revenue.

Alibaba Cloud is China\u2019s largest and the world\u2019s largest public cloud provider. Ant Group: This is Alibaba\u2019s digital payments vertical and the number of annual active users served by Ant Group (including nine e-wallet partners) touched 1.3 billion in the 12-months prior to March 2020. A growing and expanding addressable market We can see that Alibaba is one of the largest e-commerce and online companies in the world. Its business vertical comprises of core commerce, cloud computing, retail, and digital media. In the last two decades, the company has benefitted from the evolution of China\u2019s digital landscape as well as an increase in the purchasing power of its populace. China\u2019s growth story of its rising middle class and the shift towards online shopping will continue to drive Alibaba\u2019s top-line figures higher. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will, in fact, accelerate the shift towards e-commerce and allow Alibaba\u2019s digital infrastructure to gain significant traction amid an uncertain macro environment. In fiscal 2020, Alibaba surpassed $1 trillion in gross merchandise volume which was an important milestone given China\u2019s total annual retail sales for consumer goods is about $6 trillion. In the next decade, China\u2019s GDP is forecast to grow by at least 5% annually while its internet and cloud computing markets are forecast to grow by 10% and 16% respectively. Alibaba continues to focus on investing in growth and in a recent shareholder letter it said, \u201cOur next goal is to serve more than 1 billion consumers in China and facilitate more than RMB10 trillion of consumption on our platforms in the next five years as we continue on the path of globalization.\u201d It added, \u201cOur longer-term goals are to serve 2 billion consumers globally, create 100 million jobs and provide the necessary infrastructure to support 10 million small businesses to become profitable on our platforms by 2036.\u201d BABA stock is trading at an attractive valuation BABA stock is trading at a forward price to sales multiple of 7.1x while its forward price to earnings multiple is 29x. These valuations are extremely attractive given the company\u2019s expected revenue and earnings growth. According to estimates from Yahoo! Finance, BABA is forecast to increase sales by 31.1% to $95.4 billion in fiscal 2021 and by 26% year-over-year to $120.06 billion in 2022. Comparatively, its earnings growth is forecast at 15% for 2021 and 28% in 2022. Analysts tracking BABA stock have a 12-month average target price of $284.23 which is about 13% higher than the current trading price. The verdict Alibaba stock will be volatile given the current tensions between China and the U.S. BABA stock slumped over 5% last Friday as President Donald Trump said apps including TikTok and WeChat will be banned by the end of September. However, Alibaba\u2019s rapidly expanding market, profitable businesses, low valuation, and rising margins make it an enticing bet for long-term investors. BABA stock needs to gain 47% to touch a valuation of $1 trillion in market cap. There is a good chance Alibaba will reach this milestone before the end of 2021.
