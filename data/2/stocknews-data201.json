Despite second-quarter GDP dropping by 33%, the stock market quickly recovered its losses. Most of the market\u2019s gains were concentrated in tech as it was the most resilient and many companies actually saw an increase in sales. At one point, the Nasdaq was almost 20% above its pre-coronavirus levels. However, in September, we got a much-needed correction with the Nasdaq dropping by nearly 15%. While there were concerns that a bubble was forming in tech, recent earnings reports validate much of the gains in stock prices. As the tech industry is set to grow substantially in the future, investors should use the market dip to add exposure to technology.
