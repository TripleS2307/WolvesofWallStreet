(SPCE) is surging on Wall St. bank recommendations. Virgin Galactic\u2019s commercial space tourism services are closer to becoming reality. The coronavirus-related expansion of the wealth gap may expand the firm\u2019s customer list. Everything that rises, falls \u2013 unless it breaks out of gravity\u2019s reach. This may be the case for Virgin Galactic as shares of SPCE shares have leapt by more than 25% since it\u2019s closing price last Friday. This meteoric rise is due to Bank of America\u2019s Ron Epstein joining a lengthening list of buy recommendations on Monday. Epstein initiated coverage of SPCE with a \u201cBuy\u201d rating and a $35 price target. He said, \u201cNo company in our coverage universe has anywhere near comparable growth potential.\u201d That triggered Virgin\u2019s fourth-largest leap on record. SPCE Stock Forecast 9 \"BUY THE DIP\" Growth Stocks For 20201) Bank recommendations: Susquehanna also rated SPCE a \u201cBuy\u201d on Monday, making a total of 8 Wall St. banks that have a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the stock. 2) Leading position: Sir Richard Branson\u2019s company is nearing its inaugural flight \u2013 sending the man himself to the edge of space. Virgin Galactic has completed 27 out of 29 milestones and sending Branson on a rocket is planned for the first quarter of 2021. The next space tourism flights are due shortly afterward. The British billionaire has two significant rivals \u2013 Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. Musk is the owner of Tesla and SpaceX, yet the latter firm is busy launching rockets and its founder seems more interested in reaching Mars. Bezos owns Amazon, yet his space firm Blue Origin is significantly behind Branson\u2019s efforts. Virgin\u2019s lead in the space tourism field will likely help it launch its service first \u2013 potentially making it synonymous with the industry. 3) Coronavirus effect: The global pandemic \u2013 which has recently surpassed one million confirmed deaths \u2013 may also boost Virgin Galactic and its stock price. The firm has already sold tickets at prices ranging from $200,000 to $250,000, a sum that very few can afford. The coronavirus has devastated the lives of those with lower incomes but has boosted living standards of those able to work from home. Net savings for those with higher incomes have leapt, as they continued working and were unable to spend. Rising house prices \u2013 a side effect of the pandemic and government support \u2013 also raised the net worth of those already doing well. That, in turn, increases the pool of potential customers able to purchase flights beyond the skies. Overall, the mix of upbeat bank recommendations, the proximity to launching its first flight, and the effects of the pandemic make SPCE appealing. At its current price of around $20, Virgin Galactic\u2019s share is still far from the peak above $25 recorded in the summer and less than half of the 52-week high of $42.49. 2020 Elections: How stocks, gold, and the dollar could move in four scenarios, nightmare one included SPCE shares were trading at $20.85 per share on Tuesday afternoon, up $0.34 (+1.66%). Year-to-date, SPCE has gained 80.52%, versus a 4.77% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period."}]}
