That\u2019s because a key resistance level has formed on the stock\u2019s chart. PSNL is a provider of advanced genomic sequencing and analytics solutions to support the development of personalized cancer vaccines and other next-generation cancer immunotherapies. The company received some good news last week as the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Million Veteran Program exercised its option to extend PSNL\u2019s existing contract through September 2021 and issued a new order worth up to $31 million. Take a look at the 1-year chart of PSNL below with added notations: 7 \"SAFE HAVEN\" Dividend Stocks for Turbulent Times Chart of PSNL provided by TradingView PSNL has been trending higher ever since its March bottom. However, the stock eventually stalled, as PSNL has now hit the same resistance at $25 (red) on two separate occasions. The $25 area is also a 52-week high for the stock. A solid close above that mark should lead to another leg higher for the PSNL. Therefore a trader could buy the stock on a breakout above that level with a stop order placed under it, to serve as protection. Want to See My Favorite Stock Trades Today?
