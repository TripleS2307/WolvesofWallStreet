The platform leverages technology to encourage everyone to participate and rose to fame primarily by offering commission-free trades, no account minimums, and an easy-to-use mobile app. With people spending more time at home and many sports being shut down, Robinhood found an audience with young and first-time investors. While Robinhood doesn\u2019t force users to trade and the platform can be used responsibly, critics say it gamifies investing. Robinhood publishes a list of the 100 most popular stocks on its platform based on how many users own the stock. For a stock to be listed on Robinhood\u2019s 100 list, it usually has created some type of buzz in the market. Sometimes these stocks may not be the best investments long-term. While not all stocks listed on Robinhood are fundamentally sound, there are definitely some stocks that possess both popular sentiment and underlying financial strength. Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA), NIO Inc. (NIO), and Activision Blizzard, Inc (ATVI) are four such Robinhood-listed stocks that still have upside left. 7 Best ETFs for the NEXT Bull MarketAmazon.com, Inc.
