However, in terms of year-to-date price performance, BYND is the clear winner with 155.8% gains versus CAG\u2019s 8.8%. Also, BYND\u2019s six-month gains of 178.4% are significantly higher than CAG\u2019s 19%. But which stock is the better buy now?

CAG also reported a profitable fiscal first quarter ended June 2020 with a 12.1% year-over-year increase in net sales to $2.70 billion. This growth can be attributed to the 15% year-over-year rise in organic net sales. EPS increased 86.1% from the year-ago value to $0.67.
