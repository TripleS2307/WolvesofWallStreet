While lockdown and social distancing norms pushed many businesses to the verge of bankruptcy, the stock market continued to rally. The S&P 500 index gained more than 55% since hitting its low on 23rd March to reach a fresh all-time high of $3,481.07 on August 26th. On the other hand, the U.S. economy shrank at an annual rate of 33% in the quarter ended June. This erratic behavior of the benchmark for the broader stock market can be attributed to the pandemic-perfect business model of the companies having highest weightage in the index. The winning tech giants, Apple, Inc. (AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet, Inc. (GOOGL), Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) and Facebook (FB), have a combined weightage of approximately 23.5% in the S&P 500 index. These companies have gained significant momentum over the past few months as the demand for advanced and user-friendly technology have increased due to the increasing reliance on the digital mode of living, learning and working. Though the United States is slowly recovering from the pandemic, analysts predict the \u201cnew normal\u201d to continue for the foreseeable future with no definitive assurance from the vaccine developers. 7 Best ETFs for the NEXT Bull MarketThe momentum for these tech giants is expected to continue with the upcoming 5G boom.

Since then, it has gained more than 150% to hit its 52-week high in August, as investor confidence was restored when APPL announced its fiscal third quarter results.

With the demand for personal computers on the rise, AAPL also rolled out updated versions of its Macbook for a better user experience. It also launched a radio music service called Apple Music Radio on August 18th. AAPL\u2019s EPS is expected to grow at 12.5% per annum over the next five years. Moreover, AAPL beat the consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, which is impressive. How does AAPL stack up for the POWR Ratings?

As a result, GOOGL\u2019s share of the U.S. digital ad market is expected to fall 220 basis points to 29.4% in 2020. However, GOOGL\u2019s cloud services have steadily gained popularity during this time, with Google Meet emerging as a strong contender to Zoom.
