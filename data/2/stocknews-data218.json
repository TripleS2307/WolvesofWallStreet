While the more conventional ETFs will pay you 3% if you\u2019re lucky, high-yield closed-end funds can pay out a lot more. With an average yield of 7.2%, according to data from my CEF Insider service, CEFs pay much more than the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF (SDY), which yields a meager 2.7%! 9 \"BUY THE DIP\" Growth Stocks For 2020Source: CEF Insider There are some off-the-beaten path ETFs that do have big yields, like the Global X SuperDividend ETF (SDIV), which pays a shocking 12.3% dividend as I write this. But don\u2019t be fooled; these high-yield ETFs are sometimes wolves in sheep\u2019s clothing. While SDIV\u2019s income stream looks impressive, a deeper dive shows real cause for concern. The fund focuses almost exclusively on dividend yield when choosing stocks to buy, which is why its performance has been poor. In fact, we can use three similarly high-yielding CEFs to show where SDIV falls short. For this example, I have taken the PIMCO Income Strategy Fund (PFL), Guggenheim Strategic Opportunities Fund (GOF) and Clough Global Opportunities Fund (GLO). These funds are all high yielders, with payouts of 11.5% on average, a bit less than SDIV, but very much in the ballpark. And all of these funds have crushed SDIV. CEFs the Clear Winner Let\u2019s put this chart in perspective. If you invested $100,000 in these three CEFs in 2011, when SDIV held its IPO, you\u2019d now have $204,590, including the $1,961 monthly income stream from these funds. But with SDIV, you\u2019d have $87,010\u2014less than you started with! And your income stream would be just $906.33, less than half of the CEF portfolio alternative. (As you\u2019ll see below, SDIV\u2019s dividend payout has been less than stable.) Why the big difference? Because total returns are vital to take into account. The total return is the combined capital gains and income you get from an investment. A fund that loses your money while giving you an income stream, like SDIV has done, cannot compound. I think you\u2019ll agree that this is no way to create wealth. CEFs, fortunately, deliver both capital gains and income streams. There are literally hundreds of CEFs that deliver both and have been delivering both for a decade or longer. But why can\u2019t SDIV re-create this kind of performance? Why are CEFs different? The answer boils down to regulation and incentives\u2014and it\u2019s a story worth digging into. Why CEFs Beat High-Yield ETFs CEFs are regulated by the Investment Company Act of 1940, which sets limits of what these funds can do. One of the things the law does not require is daily reporting of portfolio changes. As a result, CEF managers can actively manage their funds without their competitors seeing what they\u2019re doing. ETFs are different. They\u2019re required to report their holdings every day, so buy and sells are immediately known. This is why there are so few actively managed ETFs; anyone could look at their portfolio and copy their strategy immediately. As a result, ETFs tend to be managed by a bunch of rules that dictate what can and cannot be sold, according to an algorithm or some broad idea. In SDIV\u2019s case, the idea is simply to invest in high-yielding stocks around the world. It\u2019s a simple strategy that does not account for changes in the economy. CEFs, on the other hand, can (and do) adapt to market changes: every non-energy equity CEF tracked by CEF Insider has outperformed SDIV since that fund\u2019s inception for obvious reasons: the equity CEFs have management that can (and does) react to market changes. SDIV does not. This also means that most equity CEFs invest in well-known, top-performing companies. Would it surprise you to learn that Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) are some of the most popular holdings in CEFs? But SDIV, because of its mandate, doesn\u2019t own any of these firms. Similarly, a couple of tech CEFs recorded strong gains in 2020 by buying and selling Tesla (TSLA) as that company\u2019s stock jumped and plunged this year. Again, that\u2019s something SDIV can\u2019t do. These are just the start. Thanks to their structure and freedom, CEFs can give you a diversified portfolio of many assets\u2014tech stocks, real estate, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, preferred stocks\u2014that shelters you from a decline in any one asset class while giving you stable income all the while. Very few CEFs cut their dividends during the COVID-19 selloff in March, and more are beginning to increase their payouts now that the market is recovering. Meanwhile, SDIV\u2019s payouts are dropping because it cannot adapt to the pandemic. SDIV\u2019s Dividend Wilts The bottom line? For high yields that stay high, CEFs are clearly a far better choice than ETFs. Want More Great Investing Ideas?
