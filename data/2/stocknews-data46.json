Let\u2019s find out. 9 \"BUY THE DIP\" Growth Stocks For 2020Latest Movements FB is one of the best-performing stocks during the pandemic due to the increasing popularity of social media. It owns WhatsApp and Instagram, making it the biggest social media company in the world. FB invested $5.70 billion in India\u2019s Reliance Jio in April, which allowed the company to increase its market reach in the second largest internet user market. FB recently rolled out its business suite, allowing companies to advertise seamlessly on its platform. It is also planning on rolling ads limit on individual pages to reduce the cost of advertising while improving its performance, through integrated machine learning and personalization options. SNAP developed new camera and augmented reality experiences for developers, creators, and snapchat users in June. It also partnered with Headspace to develop a new series of features to promote the mental and emotional wellbeing of its users. SNAP also developed a new product called \u201chappening Now\u201d to deliver the latest news to its users. Furthermore, Disney, ESPN, ViacomCBS, MTV, NBA, NBC, and NFL expanded their commitments to deliver more content to Snapchat Discover. SNAP also developed several products across its Snap Kit, Snap Games, and Bitmoji systems to engage its user base. Recent Financial Results FB reported an 11% year-over-year increase in its revenues to $18.69 billion in the second quarter ended June 2020. Both net income and EPS improved 98% from the same period last year to $5.18 billion and $1.80, respectively. Its daily active users increased by 12% year-over-year to 2.70 billion. SNAP\u2019s revenue and daily active users both increased 17% year-over-year to $454 million and 238 million, respectively, in the second quarter ended June 2020. Thus, FB has an edge over SNAP here.

SNAP is an advantageous position here. However, given FB\u2019s market valuation and user base, its relatively lower revenue growth could result in higher earnings compared to SNAP.
