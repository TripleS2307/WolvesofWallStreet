They generally have a market cap of over $200 billion. Most companies that reach this level have a reliable brand name and operate in different countries around the world. The current rally we\u2019ve been experiencing has been primarily driven by mega-cap stocks. The Vanguard Mega Cap ETF (MGC), which tracks the MSCI US Large Cap 300 Index, a benchmark index consisting of America\u2019s largest companies, is up almost 10% year-to-date, compared with a 6.5% gain for the S&P 500. As I wrote in a previous article, I believe the stock market is currently a bubble. Many investors feel that mega-cap stocks are driving this bubble up, as the FAAMG stocks, Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) currently represent more than 20% of the S&P 500. 7 Best ETFs for the NEXT Bull MarketWhile many mega-cap companies are overvalued based on numerous valuation metrics, some of them deserve these high valuations. I evaluate stocks based on several factors, such as past and future growth, profitability, financial health, and short and medium-term momentum. I ran my proprietary screen for mega-cap stocks, and the results yielded four well-known companies that are also rated a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d by our exclusive POWR Ratings system: Adobe (ADBE), Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT), and NVIDIA (NVDA). Adobe (ADBE) ADBE provides content creation, document management, and digital marketing and advertising software and services to creative professionals and marketers. The company operates with three segments: digital media content creation, digital experience for marketing solutions, and publishing for legacy products.

Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Adobe Experience Cloud are primarily driving sales growth. In the fiscal first quarter, total Digital Media Annualized recurring revenue, a key cloud performance measure, grew to $8.73 billion. The company is also seeing increasing subscription revenues and momentum in its mobile apps. ADBE has a three-year average sales growth rate of 22.6% and a forward EBITDA growth rate of 30%.

Overall, ADBE has excellent long-term growth potential due to its competitive advantage, the global growth of creative professionals, and the corporate transition to cloud products. Facebook (FB) FB is the world\u2019s largest online social network, with 2.5 billion monthly active users. The company\u2019s portfolio consists of the Facebook app, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. Users can engage with one another by exchanging messages and sharing news events, photos, and videos. These engagements can create an addictive fear of missing out, bringing users back to the platform repeatedly. Advertising revenue represents more than 90% of the company\u2019s total revenue, half of which comes from the U.S. and Canada. The company is continuing to see an increase in online and mobile advertising spending and is looking to increase revenue through video advertising. Video has become very popular on its platforms and is the most lucrative form of digital advertising. Instagram also serves as a moneymaker for the company due to its ad platform. FB is also looking to monetize Messenger and WhatsApp further. The stock has a three-year sales growth rate of 31.2% and projects a 23.9% growth rate next year. The company has a return on equity and an ROIC over 21%. It also has a current ratio of 6.0, which means it has plenty of liquidity to pay off debt.

The company has tremendous long-term revenue and EPS growth potential due to the shift from traditional advertising to digital.

The company has a dominant position in the desktop PC market, with its operating systems being used in most PCs worldwide, especially in the enterprise market where MSFT generates most of its revenue. As computing is undergoing changes where companies are switching to the \u201cbring-your-own-device\u201d model, MSFT has been launching new Surface devices that may encourage enterprises to stick with Windows. The company has also become a significant player in cloud computing. Its Azure product has increased availability in 58 regions globally. MSFT is also expanding its Microsoft Teams subscriber base by adding new capabilities that enable users to work from home during the coronavirus crisis. MSFT has a three average sales growth rate of 16.7% and an EPS three-year growth rate of 23.5%. Forecasts for next year include a 16.7% jump in revenue and 13.6% growth for EPS.

The firm\u2019s chips are used in a variety of end markets, including high-end PCs for gaming, data centers, and automotive infotainment systems.

Revenue came in at $3.87 billion, a 50% increase from the same quarter last year.

The company has seen steady growth in gaming due to increased demand in GeForce desktops and notebook GPUs.
