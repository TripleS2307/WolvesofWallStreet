The goal is to find which stocks have been the best \u2014 and worst \u2014 for premium buyers. The SVS is a very useful tool for premium sellers too, as \u201cthe worst\u201d for a premium buyer can be construed as \u201cthe best\u201d for a premium seller. Using our robust historical database, we conduct extensive research on each underlying equity and determine which of those underlying equities\u2019 options have historically had underpriced or overpriced options. We rank each equity\u2019s options relative to the others in our universe, with scores ranging from zero to 100. For more information on how to use these scores, please review instructions following the scorecard. Below is a deeper dive into three stocks that showed up on our comprised list; payments processing specialist Square Inc (NYSE:SQ), clean energy stock Enphase Energy Inc (NASDAQ:ENPH), and food delivery service GrubHub Inc (NYSE:GRUB). 7 Best ETFs for the NEXT Bull MarketWhat\u2019s the uniting thread between these three unique stocks? Right now SQ, ENPH, and GRUB all boast SVS\u2019 of 98, 100, and 96, respectively. In simpler terms, all three stocks have tended to exceed option traders\u2019 volatility expectations during the past year, a good thing for option buyers. At last check, SQ was up 3.4% to trade at $127.75, a chip-shot from its July 9 record high of $133.81. The shares have almost quadrupled off their March 18 lows of $32.33, and have more than doubled in 2020. During this channel of higher highs, the ascending equity\u2019s 20-day moving average has stepped up as admirable support. A short squeeze could be fueling these gains. Short interest fell 13.8% in the two most recent reporting periods, yet still accounts for a healthy 8.2% of SQ\u2019s total available float. The security could also benefit from a shift in analyst sentiment, as 22 of the 35 in coverage still rate it a \u201chold\u201d or worse. Switching over to ENPH, the California-based solar energy name was last seen up 3.6% at $59.32. Like Square, Enphase stock has also more than doubled in 2020, but remains way off its May 19 record high of $70.36. Enphase shorts are headed for the exits, down 5.7% in the two most recent reporting periods. Yet that 11.63 million shares sold short still take up 10.1% of ENPH\u2019s total available float, so a continued exodus of bearish bets could keep the wind at the equity\u2019s back. And lastly there\u2019s GrubHub stock, which at last check was up 1.4% at $71.06. GRUB is up 109% in the last nine months, with its 30-day moving average containing the last month\u2019s consolidation on the charts. Now looks like a good time to get in on GrubHub with options, too. Despite its July 30 earnings report, GRUB\u2019s Schaeffer\u2019s Volatility Index (SVI) of 50% ranks in the 10th percentile of its annual range. This suggests options players have been pricing in relatively low volatility expectations of late. SQ shares rose $1.12 (+0.87%) in after-hours trading Thursday. Year-to-date, SQ has gained 106.41%, versus a 1.69% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period."}]}
