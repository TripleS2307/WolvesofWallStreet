Over the past couple of days, the index has broken out of the top-end of the range. Many skeptics believe the breakout is a trap that will lead to a brutal reversal. Others see it as the beginning of a trending move that will challenge the previous, all-time highs set in February before the coronavirus crisis. This earnings season will be a major factor in deciding the fate of this breakout. It\u2019s either going to validate the market\u2019s optimism or show that fundamentals are inconsistent with the bullish price action. 9 \"BUY THE DIP\" Growth Stocks For 2020The most anticipated earnings will be for tech stocks as this sector is responsible for much of the market\u2019s recent gains. While the S&P 500 is 4% below its all-time high, the Nasdaq is 10% above its previous high.
