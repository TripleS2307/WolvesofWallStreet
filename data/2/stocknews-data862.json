The Nasdaq, the tech-heavy index, is actually not only at 52-week highs but also trading at all-time highs. So it\u2019s not surprising that NXPI has doubled in price since hitting its 52 week low just a few months ago. As you can see in the chart below, NXPI has formed a clear trendline of support (blue) as shares have been rising. Take a look at the 1-year chart of NXPI below with my added notations: Chart of NXPI provided by TradingView Any 2 points can start a trend line but the more times the stock tests the trendline, the more relevant it becomes. In this case NXPI has traded near or at it\u2019s trend line 6 times. There are 2 ways to use a trendline to trade. The first is \u201cbuy the dip.\u201d If you think the stock is strong and it has a pullback, you could buy the stock near the trendline. In this scenario, we believe there is a good chance the stock will bounce off the trendline and you\u2019ll see a profitable trade. The second way to make a trade using a trendline of support, is to wait patiently for the stock to break it\u2019s trendline support to the downside. If/when it does, initiate a short position with the assumption that there will be a breakdown. Have a good trading day! Good luck!
