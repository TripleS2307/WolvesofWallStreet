Apple\u2019s (AAPL) franchise in smartphones and personal computers and tablets is unrivaled. At the end of last week, MSFT and APPL had a combined market cap of an incredible $3.142 trillion. Each company is a member of the exclusive club with a value of over $1.5 trillion. When it comes to computers, the first names that come to mind are Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, the founders of the two companies. The shares of both companies fell dramatically with the rest of the stock market in March. Fears over the global pandemic gripped markets across all asset classes caused a temporary spike to the downside in the shares. At the end of last week, MSFT shares were almost 57% above the March low after making a new record high. AAPL shares were over 75% higher after reaching an all-time peak in June. 9 \"BUY THE DIP\" Growth Stocks For 2020Coronavirus has presented a challenge for many companies across all business sectors.

The two tech franchises continue to be an integral part of most investment portfolios. Tweaking the business to stay ahead- Closing retail outlets The global pandemic will change the business world. Retail stores were already showing signs of a steady decline. During the annual holiday season, sales on \u201cBlack Friday,\u201d the day after Thanksgiving, have declined compared to on cyber Monday. The popularity and ease of shopping online have changed retail businesses forever. Meanwhile, social distancing and stay at home guidelines during the global pandemic has only hastened the demise of retail and bolstered the rise of e-commerce. Last week, Microsoft announced that it was closing all of its physical stores and transforming just four flagship establishments into \u201cexperience centers\u201d to cause consumers to seek support over the phone or via online links. Apple could be moving in the same direction as Microsoft. Last week, the company closed 28% of its retail outlets in the US because of new outbreaks and hotspots for coronavirus. The temporary closures include fifteen stores in California, ten in Texas, five of Georgia\u2019s six locations, four of five stores in Nevada, and two in Florida. Apple has a total of 271 stores across the US, and the company said \u201cWe look forward to resuming full operations as soon as it\u2019s safe to do so,\u201d but the shutdowns since February and March did not stop the company from continuing to sell its products, and the shares are at a record level. I would not be surprised to see Apple\u2019s Genius Support to move online as the business transforms. Lower overheads may translate to lower product prices for consumers as well as higher earnings for the two technology giants. Meanwhile, both MSFT and AAPL are both in a position to acquire smaller technology companies to expand their suite of products and services. The tech sector leaders should continue to thrive in the post-COVID 19 environment as they transform their business to reflect the changes in human behavior. Technology has risen above the global pandemic on so many levels.
