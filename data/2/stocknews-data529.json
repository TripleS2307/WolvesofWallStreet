Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies (WAB) is a provider of value-added, technology-based products and services for the rail industry. It provides its products and services through two main business segments, the Freight and Transit. The company\u2019s merger with GE transportation is one component driving revenue. The merger increased WAB\u2019s freight services capabilities and capacity. Take a look at the 1-year chart of WAB below with added notations: 7 Best ETFs for the NEXT Bull Market Chart of WAB provided by TradingView After selling off from February into March, WAB rallied back up to hit a high of $72.50 in June and then sold off again. Since bottoming around $55, the stock has rallied back up to the $72.50 resistance (red) and now appears to have formed a cup (green) and handle pattern. A cup and handle is a bullish continuation pattern that marks a consolidation period followed by a breakout. As its name implies, there are two parts to the pattern: the cup and the handle. The cup forms after an advance and looks like a bowl or \u201crounding bottom\u201d. As the cup is completed, a trading range develops on the right hand side and the handle is formed. A subsequent breakout from the handle\u2019s trading range, and through the resistance created by the cup, usually signals a continuation of the prior advance. Therefore, a trader could buy WAB if/when the $72.50 resistance level is broken, in anticipation of a breakout. Want to Discover More Great Trades?
