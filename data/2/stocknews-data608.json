Amidst the doom and gloom, Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR) and Trulieve (OTC:TCNNF) shined as both stocks rose for the week. Here are some highlights from the cannabis industry in the past five days: 9 \"BUY THE DIP\" Growth Stocks For 2020IIPR Posts Strong Earnings IIPR reported strong Q2 earnings on Wednesday. Despite a challenging environment for cannabis, IIPR clearly has been weathering the storm. The company reported revenue of $24.3 million, which was a 183% increase. Its net income for the quarter was $13 million, a 322% increase from the prior year. IIPR has performed well, while other companies in the industry have struggled, due to the coronavirus pandemic. The company is also able to provide struggling cannabis companies with capital through their acquisition and sale-leaseback agreement. This should bode well for the long term as it will be able to acquire more properties at potentially discounted valuations. ACB Continues to Lose Steam As the cannabis sector remains in a downtrend, Aurora Cannabis (ACB) continues to lose steam and is heading back to single digits. Earlier in the week, ACB briefly dropped below $10 before recovering.
