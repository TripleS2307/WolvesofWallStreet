The plummeting demand for solar energy in both residential and commercial properties led to widespread job losses, especially in the United States. With the gradual recovery of the global economy as businesses adjust their work environment under the \u201cnew normal,\u201d the solar industry started recovering as well. In fact, since the overall market crash in March, solar stocks performed better than the rest of the clean energy sector as well as some of the technology players. This is evident from Invesco Solar ETF\u2019s (TAN) gain of almost 90% since mid-March compared to the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite\u2019s gain of about 40% over the same time period. In addition to announcing several partnership agreements and expansion projects, most of the solar companies reported impressive financials for the second quarter. 7 Best ETFs for the NEXT Bull MarketWith rising stock prices and sound financials, investing in Enphase Energy, Inc.
