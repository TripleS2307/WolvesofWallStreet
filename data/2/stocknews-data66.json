While the stock market skyrocketed in mid to late March thanks to the pandemic-led tech boom, the rally took a pause as looming uncertainties related to the upcoming presidential election, an arrival of a coronavirus vaccine, and rising geopolitical tensions. So, a more defensive strategy to play the market is to bet on dividend stocks that have the potential to maintain or increase their dividend payments. While many companies reduced or suspended their dividend payments this year, and many are considering following the same path, some companies still stand tall in terms of their dividend payments. The ability to increasingly return capital to shareholders indicates strength in their business models, which could help their stocks outperform the rest of the market. Stocks like Procter & Gamble Company (PG), Abbott Laboratories (ABT), Lowe\u2019s Companies, Inc. (LOW), and Target Corporation (TGT) haven\u2019t just been paying steady dividends, but have also increased their dividends over the last five years.
