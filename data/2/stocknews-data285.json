(CRM) is a well-known stock in the tech industry. On May 22nd, CRM was named the #1 customer experience and relationship management provider and global leader by International Data Corporation and Worldwide Semiannual Software Tracker. It has the highest market share with 19.5%, according to Gartner, Inc. After a massive gain since the market crash in March, CRM witnessed a pullback due to the recent tech sell-off. The stock lost 16.5% in one week. While many investors are worried about a tech-stock bubble, which could lead to a dotcom 2.0 crisis, the majority of Wall Street analysts have classified the recent tech sell-off as a healthy market correction. The market showed signs of recovery on September 9th, as Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and S&P 500 gained slightly. As the market wiped off a portion of CRM\u2019s gain, it could be a good time to enter the stock. CRM is currently rated \u201cBuy\u201d in our proprietary ratings system. CRM gained more than 50% year-to-date. It delivered strong financials in the fiscal second quarter ended July 2020 as the cloud computing industry gained prominence under the work-and-learn- from home normal. 7 \"SAFE HAVEN\" Dividend Stocks for Turbulent TimesHere\u2019s how our proprietary POWR Ratings system evaluates CRM: Trade Grade: A CRM is currently trading way above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages of $210.31 and $178.83, respectively. The golden-cross price performance indicates bullishness. Moreover, CRM gained more than 43% in the last three months, signaling a solid short-term uptrend in the stock. CRM\u2019s impressive performance in the last reported quarter positively influenced its Trade grade. Its revenues increased 29% year-over-year to $5.15 billion in the fiscal second quarter.

CRM\u2019s long-term gains can be attributed to the soaring tech industry and the expectation for the 5G boom.

As the social-distancing norm has forced all activities online, the demand for cloud computing systems to sustain virtual working and learning environments has increased. Despite the current tech sell-off, the industry is expected to bounce back in no time. Also, the ongoing race for 5G should fuel the growth of companies operating in this industry. Overall POWR Rating: B (Buy) Overall, CRM is rated \u201cBuy\u201d under our POWR Ratings system, taking into account the strong price performance, short-and-long-term bullishness, impressive financial reports, and favorable analyst sentiment.
