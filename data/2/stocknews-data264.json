Another summer has come and gone. It\u2019s been a challenging year. Lockdowns\u2026 fake news\u2026 civic unrest\u2026 9 \"BUY THE DIP\" Growth Stocks For 2020And a market that thinks it\u2019s a pogo stick \u2014 up and down\u2026 up and down\u2026 Right now, it\u2019s at the \u2018down\u2019 part of that cycle. Lucky for us, we recently took a bevy of bearish positions in small-cap stocks. All had been underperforming the market as well as their sector peers. As of this writing, all five are in the black. (Our Put options have gained in value as the underlying stocks lost value with the market selloff.) Last week, the market continued the weakness that began with the September 3 selloff. All major indices lost ground. Here they are, ranked from best to worst: Technology took it on the chin. The Nasdaq Composite lost more than 4%. On Thursday, my friend and colleague Costas Bocelli wrote about \u201cthe Nas\u201d. He pointed out that it had plunged -10% between September 3 and September 8. That decline came just as the tech-heavy average had broken yet another all-time high. And it marked the quickest correction (loss of 10% or greater) from an all-time high in the history of the Nasdaq. Looking at the \u201cinternal market\u201d, we\u2019re seeing short-term weakness all around. The Nasdaq\u2019s Bullish Percent Index (BPI) chart has flipped into a column of Os. That means the indicator is considered weak in the short term. What\u2019s more, the chart also just went on a \u201cSell signal\u201d (the red arrow). That means the indicator is considered weak in the longer term. The Bullish Percent Index charts for the S&P 500 Index, the Russel 2000 (RUT) and the S&P 600 (SML) are all in O-columns right now. Here\u2019s the S&P\u2026 Like the Nasdaq, the S&P was recently far into \u201coverbought\u201d territory (the region of the chart up above the 70 level). A pullback was inevitable. The chart is still on a \u201cBuy signal\u201d. That means the S&P is considered strong in the longer term. If the current O-column gets as low as the box marked by that red arrow, then the S&P will go on a Sell signal. The RUT shows a similar set up. The chart is in Os (weak over the short term) but still on a Buy signal (strong over the longer-term). If the chart fills in just two more boxes (the red arrow) it will go on a Sell signal. Same with the SML\u2026 The only major BPI that\u2019s still showing strength over the short term \u2014 still in a column of Xs \u2014 is the New York Stock Exchange BPI: The NYSE BPI shows us the percentage of stocks trading on the NYSE that are currently on point-and-figure Buy signals on their respective price charts. The purple rectangle at the top right tells us that 56.83% of NYSE stocks meet that condition. Follow the red highlighted bar from the far right-hand side of the chart across to the left-hand side. It begins at an empty box immediately to the right of the current (highlighted) column. You can see that it ends at the \u201956 box\u2019 \u2014 or \u201c56%\u201d. If this chart falls to 56%, that box (and the two above it) will fill with Os and the NYSE BPI will have \u201cflipped\u201d. Supply will be in control. We\u2019re not there yet \u2014 but we\u2019re close. Will we get there? The odds say \u201cyes\u201d. But \u201cMister Market\u201d says: \u201cThat\u2019s for me to know and you to find out.\u201d (For a lot more on the NYSE BPI, you should visit our BPI Portal. We update the page whenever the chart makes an important move.) What\u2019s not in doubt is that Supply has taken control of most market sectors. Below are some snapshots of the market broken down into 45 sectors. (Image courtesy of our Premium data service, Sector Prophets Pro.) The blue boxes show sectors whose BPI charts are in X-columns (meaning that Demand is in control of that sector)\u2026 And the red boxes show sectors whose BPI charts are in O-columns (meaning that Supply is in control). Just two weeks ago, on August 28, Demand (the bulls) controlled 30 sectors \u2014 67%, or two-thirds of the market. The bears controlled just 15. Here\u2019s a snapshot of the market as of Friday\u2019s close: In two weeks\u2019 time, we saw the bears rear up and seize 22 more sectors. They now control 72% of the market. As always, we\u2019re not going to try to predict what the market will do. All we can do is see clearly where we are. The market was just wildly overbought. The S&P and Nasdaq were putting in new highs. We expected a pullback, and we got it. What\u2019s more, the market had recently been historically oversold \u2014 washed out. Here\u2019s the BPI of the S&P again\u2026 I\u2019ve drawn a second red arrow showing the March 23 market bottom. As you can see, the chart got as low as 4%. Anything below 30% is considered oversold. If the market were a blues singer, it\u2019d be saying: \u201cI\u2019m so far down it looks like up to me\u201d. When the market is that oversold, all the scared or uncommitted investors head for the hills. They\u2019re not all that eager to come back in right away. A lot of that timid money is still on the sidelines. It\u2019s available to push prices higher when the market rallies. So, despite the recent tech-wreck/pullback\u2026 the market should still find it easier to rally higher again. Of course, that doesn\u2019t mean it will. For the moment, we\u2019ll enjoy watching our bearish plays gun higher. And we\u2019ll keep our eyes peeled for more signs of weakness\u2026 Or new signs of returning strength. Then we\u2019ll act accordingly. Have a great week! Want More Great Investing Ideas?
