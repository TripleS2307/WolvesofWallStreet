However, with the market now more than 13% off of its highs, it\u2019s a good time to begin preparing shopping lists if this market correction does send the Nasdaq-100 down closer to its 200-day moving average. While we\u2019ve seen considerable damage to many of the tech names, there are a couple of names holding up quite well, suggesting that funds are likely accumulating them. These stocks also have explosive earnings growth, which adds to their attractiveness when coupled with their relative strength in the past two weeks. 7 \"SAFE HAVEN\" Dividend Stocks for Turbulent Times(Source: TC2000.com) While Nvidia (NVDA) and Crowdstrike (CRWD) have little in common, with the latter being the leader in Software-Security and the former being a juggernaut in the Semiconductor space, the two do share one crucial trait: relative strength. Although the Nasdaq-100 and S&P-500 (SPY) have slid beneath their 50-day moving averages on heavy volume, CRWD and NVDA have barely budged and haven\u2019t even tested their 50-day moving averages. This underlying strength suggests that institutions are likely accumulating these two names, as they\u2019re standing head and shoulders above their peers from a relative strength standpoint. Let\u2019s take a closer look at why institutions might be sitting on the bid for these two tech heavyweights: (Source: Company Presentation) Crowdstrike develops security solutions in the US, and its AI-powered Falcon Platform can block threats better than most other offerings in the market currently. The reason for this is that the company\u2019s cloud-scale AI gets smarter as it consumes more data, with 3 trillion events streamed to the Threat Graph per week. Crowdstrike\u2019s customer growth of 91% year-over-year and position with 49 of the Fortune 100 and 11 of the top 20 banks is a testament to its superiority and recognition as the leading tool in the marketplace currently. While many would argue that it\u2019s too late to hop aboard with CRWD already having significant penetration in the market, the company believes that its TAM could be upwards of $30 billion. With trailing-twelve-month revenue of just $700~ million, there is still a significant runway here. (Source: TC2000.com) While the above earnings trend leaves a lot to be desired as there are no earnings yet, it\u2019s important to note that net losses per share have narrowed for the past three years, and CRWD is expected to have positive earnings this year finally. This is a very positive development for the bull camp, as the bears have been citing for two years now that a lack of profitability was a concern while ignoring the company\u2019s triple-digit sales growth. As shown above, annul EPS estimates are sitting at $0.08 in FY2021 and are expected to grow to $0.30 in FY2022. Assuming the company can meet these estimates, this would translate to 275% growth year-over-year, one of the highest earnings growth rates in the market. Besides, growth funds often wait for annual EPS to be on the table before taking on significant positions, so this transition to profitability should be a tailwind. Given that the stock continues to hold up well during this correction and its leading role in the Software Security space, I would view any dips below $123.00 as buying opportunities. (Source: Company Presentation) Moving over to Nvidia, it\u2019s been an exciting year for investors, with the stock up over 90% year-to-date, massively outperforming the QQQ. The company continues to grow through acquisition and use of its position of power to its advantage, with the purchase of ARM last week for $40 billion, and the massive Mellanox acquisition last year. There are few things more bullish for a stock than growing through acquisition. It suggests that we have management that is hungry to grow market share when opportunities arise, rather than other mega-caps that sometimes get complacent and take on a caretaker approach when they reach critical mass. The recent ARM Holdings deal puts Nvidia in a position to dominate the chip industry further. Besides, the company should also benefit from cross-selling its computing products to existing ARM customers. (Source: YCharts.com, Author\u2019s Chart) If we look at the company\u2019s earnings trend above, few mega-caps can hold a candle to Nvidia\u2019s growth, with annual EPS increasing from $0.74 in FY2014 to estimates for $9.16 in FY2021. This translates to a 43% compound annual EPS growth rate, well above the average for even mid-cap growth stocks. However, growth isn\u2019t expected to stop here. Based on FY2022 estimates, NVDA is forecast to continue seeing double-digit annual EPS growth, with estimates sitting at $11.25. It\u2019s worth noting that these estimates have not included the benefit of the ARM Holdings deal, which is still subject to regulatory approvals. Assuming NVDA can close the deal, I would expect FY2023 annual EPS estimates to jump closer to $13.40 based on much higher revenues cross-selling to ARM customers, and the company\u2019s current revenue base. It isn\u2019t easy to find any mega-caps out there gobbling up companies left and right and growing annual EPS at double-digit growth rates, but NVDA is one of them. Fortunately, the stock has now reset its overbought condition in early September, sliding from near $600 to below $480 currently. While there\u2019s no guarantee that this correction is over just yet, I would expect any pullbacks closer to the stock\u2019s 150-day moving average at $420.00 to provide an exceptional buying opportunity. Therefore, while I don\u2019t think it\u2019s time to get aggressive on NVDA just yet, another 10% drop here to $429.00 would make the stock quite attractive from a valuation basis. I recently sold my position at $580.00 as the stock was getting ahead of itself, but I would consider jumping back in if this weakness continues. During a market correction, it\u2019s essential to focus on quality, and NVDA and CRWD are the definitions of high-quality. Both companies are leaders in their respective industries, they continue to gobble up market share, and they both have powerful earnings growth rates heading into FY2022. Therefore, I believe investors should keep both stocks at the top of their shopping lists. While I\u2019m not in a rush to buy either name just yet, I believe these are two stocks investors should keep a close eye on we do start to see some real panic in the market in the coming weeks.
