Further, earnings have also outperformed compared to expectations especially for the mega-cap tech stocks which comprise a large portion of the S&P 500. These factors in combination with the Fed\u2019s aggressive interventions and the federal government\u2019s fiscal largesse have resulted in a V-shaped rebound for stocks. Last week, the S&P 500 made new all-time highs. However it was a mixed week as small-caps sold-off and more economically-sensitive areas like financials and travel stocks were weak as well. Stocks that are leaders in industries with long-term growth potential outperformed. Examples of these industries are electric cars, crypto, e-commerce, and cannabis. So, it\u2019s not surprising that Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), Overstock.com, Inc. (OSTK), and GrowGeneration Corp. (GRWG) are among the stocks that gained more than 20% last week. 7 \"SAFE HAVEN\" Dividend Stocks for Turbulent TimesTesla, Inc.

TSLA reported strong second-quarter results. EPS for the quarter came in $2.18, delivering an earning\u2019s surprise of 7167%.
