The tech-heavy Nasdaq has sunk close to 10% through Friday since September 2nd, after gaining more than 70% since its March low. Rather than an indication of another market crash, this correction is seen as the return of a highly overvalued market to fair levels. Stocks in the technology sector have mainly borne the brunt of this correction. However, instead of taking this correction as a sign of weakness in the tech sector, this may provide a good opportunity for investors to enter the sector at more reasonable prices. Technology stocks have been driving the US stock market since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, and there is no reason they shouldn\u2019t do the same going forward.
