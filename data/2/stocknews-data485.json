As of this month, his estimated net worth is $78.9 billion. That\u2019s larger than the market cap of 400 companies in the S&P 500. Over the past forty years, his company Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) has outperformed the S&P 500, 81,327% to 2,657%. Many investors like to follow his lead and invest in companies he purchases. Another strategy that has also proven to yield positive results is investing in stocks using his strategies. According to Validea, a strategy that follows Buffett\u2019s ideals has returned 269% since 2003. It outperformed the market by 51.0%. Validea uses an investment strategy outlined in the book Buffettology, written by Buffett\u2019s ex-daughter-in-law, Mary Buffet. It\u2019s a book I own myself and have read many times. Unfortunately, Mr. Buffet has yet to write about his investing strategy, so this is the closest we can get to peek inside the mind of one of the greatest investors of all time. I set up a stock screen based on the criteria laid out in the book. The screener looks for stocks that have a 10-year track record of generally increasing EPS, long-term debt not more than five times annual earnings, average ROE over the past ten years of at least 15%, average ROIC over the last ten years of at least 12%, and finally, an earnings yield higher than the long term Treasury yield. I then filtered the results by stocks that are rated a Strong Buy in our POWER Ratings system to find stocks trending upwards: Williams-Sonoma (WSM), Tractor Supply Co (TSCO), and Cadence Design Systems (CDNS). 7 \"SAFE HAVEN\" Dividend Stocks for Turbulent TimesWilliams-Sonoma (WSM) WSM, which has a wide retail and direct-to-consumer presence, is a leader in the $117 billion home furnishings industry.
