However, some stocks have not performed up to expectations and are continuing to lag. Investors should pay attention to stocks that underperform when the broad market is strong as it\u2019s often an indication of poor fundamentals. Our exclusive POWR Ratings upgrade and downgrade stocks on a daily basis after reviewing a wide array of factors and can help identify these laggards. The latest POWR Ratings results show the following stocks have been downgraded to either a Strong Sell or Sell rating: Urban Outfitters (URBN), American Woodmark Corporation (AMWD), Asure Software (ASUR), Sotherly Hotels (SOHO) and Support.com (SPRT). 7 \"SAFE HAVEN\" Dividend Stocks for Turbulent TimesUrban Outfitters (URBN) It was not long ago when URBN had some of the trendiest clothing around.

Out of the 13 analysts who have performed an in-depth review of URBN, eight recommend holding, one recommends selling and only four recommend buying. American Woodmark Corporation (AMWD) This is not the best time to be in the kitchen cabinet and vanity markets. Few people have the discretionary income necessary to perform kitchen remodeling.

The stock is slotted in at #47 of 66 Home Improvement & Goods companies. AMWD has a year-to-date price return just under -30%. Though the company\u2019s \u201919 price return was solid, its three-year price return is a dismal -25%. Asure Software (ASUR) You would think internet-based workforce management services that empower companies to better manage offices including payroll and human resources functions would prove quite profitable during the pandemic. However, as revealed by the POWR Ratings, ASUR\u2019s services are not proving that lucrative. ASUR has a D Grade in all POWR Components.

The stock dipped down below $5, inched up to $6 and has stagnated from there. ASUR has a negative price return in each period of time going back three years but for the lone glimmer of hope in 2019. The company\u2019s year-to-date price return is -27%. ASUR has a three-year price return of -56%. Sotherly Hotels (SOHO) You could not pick a worse time in human history to own upscale hotels.

Support.com (SPRT) It was not long ago when the bulls were quite boisterous about SPRT. This provider of software for automating tech challenges has fallen on hard times due to increased competition in the category. The POWR Ratings show SPRT has Ds in all POWR Components but for its Industry Rank. SPRT is ranked 74 out of 82 stocks in the Software \u2013 Application category. Many companies are making lots of money in software but SPRT\u2019s products have failed to catch on with customers. SPRT had a -55% price drop in \u201919. The company also has a three-year decline of -40%.
