(PEP) and Coca-Cola Company (KO) remain well-off their pre-coronavirus levels. Naturally, the decline in dining and events has led the demand for soda to decline. While the revenue in the CDS segment is down 19.3% year-over-year in the United States, the market is expected to witness a CAGR of 6.2% between 2020 and 2025. So, both PEP and KO should witness significant growth in the years ahead especially as economies return to normal in the coming years. Both stocks have generated significant returns over the past five years. While PEP returned 73.2% over this period, KO gained 43.7%. In terms of year-to-date return or performance, PEP is a clear winner with a 5.3% return versus KO\u2019s loss of 8.8%. But which of these non-alcoholic beverage giants is the better buy now? Let\u2019s find out. 9 \"BUY THE DIP\" Growth Stocks For 2020Business Structure and Latest Movements With a market share of over $190 billion, PEP is one of the largest soft drink manufacturing companies in the world. The company\u2019s product portfolio includes a wide range of foods and beverages with 23 brands in more than 200 countries around the world. PEP is also known for its snacks subsidiary Frito Lays, which is one of the most popular chips manufacturers across the globe. Recently, PEP and Vail Resorts have announced an expansion of their longstanding partnership to 18 additional Vail Resorts locations across North America, totaling 33 total resorts globally, to advance sustainability. PEP has also teamed up with Red Lobster to leverage its iconic food and beverage brands and create a variety of new menu items, starting with the DEW Garita, the first official MTN DEW cocktail. On the other hand, KO is a total beverage company that manufactures and markets various nonalcoholic beverages worldwide. The company offers over 500 brands in more than 200 countries and territories. The 134-year old company is constantly transforming its portfolio by reducing sugar in their drinks and bringing innovative new products to market as people are turning away from high-sugar beverages. The company recently expanded its presence in the hot-beverage market through its acquisition of Costa, a leading coffee company in the United Kingdom. The beverage giant is hoping a coffee-spiked Coke will restart sales growth in January 2021, as the company is introducing Coca-Cola with coffee in the thirsty U.S. market. KO has also entered into an exclusive agreement with Molson Coors Beverage Company (TAP) to manufacture, market, and distribute Topo Chico Hard Seltzer \u2014 an alcoholic beverage \u2014 in the United States. Latest Financial Results and Outlook PEP\u2019s organic revenue for the fiscal third quarter ended June 2020 increased 4.2% year-over-year, reflecting continued strength in its global snacks and food business and a significant improvement in the global beverage business. Core constant currency EPS increased 9% year-over-year. The company expects full-year organic revenue to grow 4% and core EPS to decline by 0.5% to $5.50 year-over-year. Also, the company expects the cash return to shareholders to be approximately $7.5 billion for the full year. KO\u2019s organic revenue for the second quarter ended in June 2020 declined 26%. This was primarily driven by pressure in away-from-home channels, which represent approximately half of the company\u2019s revenues. Non-GAAP EPS declined 33% year-over-year to $0.42. Non-GAAP free cash flow declined 40% to $2.3 billion. The company expects a 3% to 4% currency headwind for full-year organic revenue. Here PEP is clearly in an advantageous position. Past and Expected Financial Performance PEP\u2019s revenue and EPS grew at a CAGR of 2.4% and 1.3%, respectively, over the past 3 years. Also, the 3-year CAGR of the company\u2019s total assets has been 5.2%. The market expects the company\u2019s revenue to increase by 1.3% in the current year and 5% next year. PEP\u2019s EPS is expected to grow 40.8% next year and at a rate of 5.5% per annum over the next five years. On the other hand, the CAGR for KO\u2019s revenue was negative 4.1% over the past 3 years, but the EPS grew at a CAGR of 30.8% over this period. The CAGR of the company\u2019s total assets has been 1.3% over the same period. The market expects KO\u2019s revenue to decline by 12% in the current year but increase by 10.4% next year. The company\u2019s EPS is expected to grow 14.4% next year and at a rate of 2.9% per annum over the next five years. PEP has an edge over KO here as well. Profitability PEP\u2019s trailing-12-month revenue is almost two times what KO generates. But KO is the more profitable with a gross profit margin of 60% versus PEP\u2019s 55.4%. However, PEP\u2019s ROE and ROA of 51.81% and 7.92% compare favorably with KO\u2019s 46.64% and 6.59%, respectively. Valuation In terms of forward P/E, PEP is currently trading at 25.64x, 5.6% less expensive than KO which is currently trading at 27.16x. PEP is also less expensive than KO in terms of trailing-12-month P/S (2.9x versus 6.14x). Moreover, PEP forward PEG of 4.43x is 49.6% lower than KO\u2019s 8.79x. In terms of trailing-12-month price/cash flow as well, PEP\u2019s 20.05x is 16.9% lower than KO\u2019s 24.13x. So, PEP looks much cheaper compared to KO by all means.
