The list gives insight into the thinking and positioning of Millennial retail traders. It\u2019s a good source of ideas but also reflects the demographic as it\u2019s full of technology and high-beta stocks. It also shows that traders on the platform like to chase high-flying stocks and dumpster-dive for stocks which have endured big sell-offs. Applying our POWR Ratings system to the Robinhood 100 is one way to filter out the bad ideas and identify the best stocks. Amazon.com, Inc.
