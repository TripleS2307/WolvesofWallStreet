The stock has tested that $50 resistance level multiple times since the beginning of June. That level is also the top of the March gap. A resistance level is a price point that a security, such as a stock, has trouble exceeding over a specific period of time. If the resistance level is broken, a trader could enter a long position above the level in anticipation of continued upward momentum in the stock price. Before making any trading decision, traders should take other factors into account, such as the direction of the overall market, as well as the trajectory of the stock\u2019s sector and industry. If you decide to enter a trade we recommend using protective stops to mitigate losses if the trade winds up not being a winner. Capital preservation is always key! Good luck!
