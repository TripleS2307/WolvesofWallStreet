Out of the 10 analysts who have performed a deep dive into TSM, nine rates it a Buy, zero recommend holding, and the only one advises selling. Though TSM spiked in recent months, it still has a fairly low forward P/E ratio of 25, considering it is a high-flying tech stock. TSM\u2019s expertise in advanced chip manufacturing should buoy its stock even if the rest of the market nosedives in the upcoming months. The bottom line is TSM\u2019s chips are building blocks of the new economy, meaning the stock should hold strong regardless of the state of the economy and the stock market as a whole.

Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN) TXN makes digital signal processing, mixed-signal, and analog integrated circuits in the United States, Europe, and Asia.

TXN is ranked second of 86 stocks in the Semiconductor & Wireless Chip category. TXN is one of the market\u2019s hottest stocks yet it is still priced below the average analyst price target of $141.52. This means TXN has more than a 3.5% upside remaining.
