This is just one more indicator that China\u2019s economy is recovering quickly. But it\u2019s not the only one. According to The Wall Street Journal, China\u2019s official Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) \u2014 which shows economic activity in China\u2019s manufacturing sector \u2014 rose to 51.1 in July. That\u2019s up from 50.9 in June. 7 Best ETFs for the NEXT Bull MarketBelow 50, the PMI indicates economic contraction. Above 50, it signals economic expansion. According to Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Burton and Libby Cherry, that could set up an historic supply squeeze. For a commodity like copper, the fundamental force of supply and demand dictates its price. The chart below illustrates demand coming from China over the past 10 years: China Monthly Copper Demand \u2013 Data from Bloomberg As you can see, China\u2019s copper habit increased dramatically over the past decade. It\u2019s up 84% from May 2010 to May 2020. The problem is that South America\u2019s mines aren\u2019t recovering as quickly as copper\u2019s demand. You see, 45% of the world\u2019s raw copper supply comes from Chile and Peru. So, as you can imagine, trouble in their mines has an impact on copper supply. We\u2019re already seeing evidence of a supply problem forming. From January to May of this year, copper supply in London Metal Exchange (LME) warehouses grew 117%. It rose from 125,250 metric tons to 271,775 metric tons. However, since the peak in May, LME warehouse supply fell 73% to just 75,550 metric tons. That\u2019s the lowest level since December 2005. You can see what I mean on this chart: While we expect some volatility in commodities, a 73% decline in just four months is steep. To put that into perspective, copper supply fell 70% during the big decline from March 2018 to March 2019. But that decline lasted a full year. We can lay this rapid decline squarely on China\u2019s recovery. The question is: What will it ultimately do to copper\u2019s price? George Daniel of Red Kite Capital Management told Bloomberg: \u201cThe market is starting to resemble that of the early 2000s, when a similar Chinese buying spree emptied the world\u2019s warehouses of copper and sent prices vaulting to record highs.\u201d Daniel\u2019s comment refers to 2002 to 2011, when copper\u2019s price rose 655% from $0.62 per pound to $4.57 per pound. While I doubt we\u2019ll see a repeat of that massive gain, conditions are right for copper prices to make new highs. We already saw gold break through its previous record price. And copper could easily do the same if it rose over 50% from today\u2019s level. That creates a great opportunity for us to profit from. Mining companies are the easiest way for most investors to get exposure to this bull market. Giant copper miner Southern Copper Corp. (SCCO) is a $30.7 billion behemoth that operates mines in Peru and Mexico. Not only does it produce copper, but it pays a healthy 3.5% dividend yield. In April 2018, Southern Copper\u2019s share price peaked at $57.34. Today, it trades at just $45.17 per share. That means the stock price needs to go up 25% to match its 2018 high. Another option is buying giant gold and copper miner Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX). The $22.7 billion company earned 69% of its revenue in 2019 from copper mines in North and South America. Freeport also owns 49% of the massive Grasberg mine in Indonesia, which accounted for the other 28% of its revenues. From 1990 to 2019, Grasberg produced 33 billion pounds of copper and 53 million ounces of gold. It\u2019s easily one of the world\u2019s greatest metal deposits. Today, Freeport\u2019s share price is $15.65 per share. In 2011, at its peak, it traded for $60.92 per share. So it would have to go up 289% to match that high. Either of these miners gives us exposure to copper\u2019s rising price \u2014 and would make a great addition to your portfolio. What More Great Investing Ideas?
