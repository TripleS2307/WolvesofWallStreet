But if you want to have a completely diversified portfolio, the addition of publicly-traded private equity firms can help spread the risk. Private equity refers to investments made into private companies. This can include venture capital that focuses on early-stage companies, growth capital, which helps established companies expand, or buyouts when a company is purchased outright. Investing in private equity is typically limited to accredited investors or very high net worth investors. One way for retail investors to gain exposure to private equity is through the stocks of private equity companies. Adding these stocks to your portfolio can provide diversification as the private equity business is less correlated to the general stock market. Blackstone Group Inc. (BX), KKR &Co. Inc.
