The world quickly adapted to this reality by isolating and separating those who had symptoms. Additionally, all non-emergency medical and dental treatment was halted. In recent weeks, these services are being restarted with an increased level of precaution with PPE, social distancing, and increased cleaning. Medical stocks will benefit from this reopening and should flourish for the rest of 2020 as people once again can see their medical practitioners. 7 \"SAFE HAVEN\" Dividend Stocks for Turbulent TimesHere are 5 healthcare stocks which can help rejuvenate your portfolio: Abott Laboratories (ABT) ABT manufactures and sells healthcare products around the globe, specializing in Diagnostic, Pharmaceutical, Vascular, and Nutritional products.

This is just one of five tests developed by the company that has received authorization by the FDA for emergency use. Earlier this month, Abbott announced FDA approval of its next-generation Gallant implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator devices to help manage heart rhythm disorders. These devices offer Bluetooth technology and a new patient smartphone app for improved remote monitoring and enhanced patient-physician engagement. ABT\u2019s stock has gained close to 60% from the 2020 low it hit in March due to the overall dip in the market.
