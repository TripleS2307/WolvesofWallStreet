(AMZN) and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (BABA), two of the world\u2019s top e-commerce and cloud infrastructure companies, have been thriving amid the pandemic due to the ability of their offerings to facilitate the \u201cnew normal\u201d way of living. As people have been forced to stay home due to the pandemic, certain activities such as shopping and working have changed significantly. More people are shopping online than ever before. Both of these companies are prime beneficiaries of this trend. Both have also generated significant returns over the past five years. While AMZN returned 490% over this period, BABA gained 355%. In terms of year-to-date performance, AMZN is a clear winner with 67.5% returns versus BABA\u2019s 27.2%. 7 \"SAFE HAVEN\" Dividend Stocks for Turbulent TimesBut which of these stocks is the better pick now? Let\u2019s find out. Business Structure and Latest Movements AMZN generates the majority of its revenues from its e-commerce platform. Amazon Prime Video, Alexa personal assistant and ecosystem, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) are the other revenue sources for the company. The stock has largely been benefitting from the pandemic due to its e-commerce business, which has witnessed rapid growth as people are ordering essentials online to stay away from the virus. The company\u2019s cloud computing platform has also been in high demand due to the accelerated pace of digital transformation adopted by businesses across the globe. The company has recently received approval for the use of drones as part of their delivery operations. This move could help the company make faster deliveries in a more cost-effective manner. Also, AMZN\u2019s entry in grocery and its initiatives to fortify its position as an online grocer powerhouse could significantly boost its revenue growth in the new normal. BABA is widely known as the Amazon of China due to its dominance in the e-commerce sector in China and forays into cloud services. Similar to AMZN, Alibaba generates most of its revenue from its e-commerce business. Brick-and-mortar commerce stores, cloud and digital media are the other sources of the company\u2019s revenues. BABA has recently announced that its logistics arm Cainiao has launched a new logistics package service which would allow the company\u2019s vendors to directly send packages from Chinese warehouses to buyers in Malaysia. This move could significantly boost the company\u2019s operations in South-East Asia. The company is also developing robots for last-mile delivery which will ease operations in the future.
