Some sectors have been hit harder than others. One sector that has weathered the storm well is the technology sector. The Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) is up 15.8% for the year. That return is higher than the S&P 500\u2019s 2% loss. Tech companies have been able to withstand the effects of the pandemic, but they are now benefiting as well. With people mainly working from home, there are far more growth opportunities for technology firms. For instance, there has been a significant shift in consumer preference for services over the internet. This leads to an increase in demand for cloud service, computers, and smartphones, leading to more demand for semiconductors. Here are three stocks that fit that demand: 9 \"BUY THE DIP\" Growth Stocks For 2020Apple (AAPL) AAPL is the dominant company in the smartphone space. The company designs everything that goes into a tablet or phone. Their customers are very loyal and continue to upgrade to a new iPhone with every release.

Its wearables, home, and accessories segment are the company\u2019s fastest-growing business. It represents 11% of sales. This is due to it\u2019s popular Apple Watch and Airpods lineup. AAPL continues to release new versions of these devices. The company holds a 29% market share in the wearable space. AAPL has also generated revenue through its services business, which includes the App Store, Apple Music, and Apple TV+. Revenue for this segment was $13 billion in the most recent quarter. The company should also benefit from a 5G iPhone that could generate even more sales. The stock is rated a Strong Buy in the StockNews.com POWR Ratings.

That\u2019s 31% of the company\u2019s total revenue. Its cloud product, Azure Cloud, is the fastest-growing cloud business in the market as the pandemic has accelerated the growth of its video meetings product, Microsoft Teams. MSFT also generates vast profits from its software products. There are now more than one billion computers and devices using Windows 10. Recently the company switched its focus to a subscription-based model called Office 365. This has led to $71 billion of cash on MSFT\u2019s balance sheet. The company pays its shareholders with 1% dividend. The stock has outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year. It is up 31.5% for the year.

MSFT recently agreed to purchase CyberX, a developer of cybersecurity solutions for the Internet of Things (IoT) market. The company will be able to integrate CyberX\u2019s tools into its portfolio of IoT security services. This should strengthen Azure Sentinel, which is its cloud-native security platform.
