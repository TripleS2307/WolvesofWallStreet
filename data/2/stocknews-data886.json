Pharmaceuticals (GWPH) stock has climbed to about $130 per share. The company, which has a $4 billion valuation, generated close to $300 million in sales for its epilepsy drug Epidiolex after being launched in the United States last year. Due to the success of Epidiolex, the company recently announced its intention to bring its flagship product Nabiximols to the U.S. market. GWPH management plans to submit the drug to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA, though the earliest this could occur is 2021. 7 \"SAFE HAVEN\" Dividend Stocks for Turbulent TimesThe company just hosted a webcast to provide investors some insight into its Phase 3 clinical program for Nabiximols. GWPH\u2019s CEO, Justin Gover said, \u201cWe are excited to present the details of our clinical program and regulatory strategy for Nabiximols, which we believe support the potential for a substantial near-term commercial opportunity in the U.S. Following constructive meetings with the FDA, we are now commencing a Phase 3 clinical program that provides multiple opportunities for an NDA submission, including as early as 2021. Beyond the initial target indication of M.S. spasticity, our Phase 3 clinical program is designed to achieve a broad spasticity label over time. This development strategy, together with the long-term exclusivity potential of Nabiximols, provides G.W. with confidence that this product should represent a significant value driver for G.W.\u201d Due to the news, H.C.
