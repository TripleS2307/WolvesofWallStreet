Preventive measures taken by governments all over the world had significant negative implications for the travel and tourism industry. In fact, this has been one of the worst hit industries. With a ban on travel, a lockdown, and other measures to dodge the virus, millions of people were forced out of work in these industries. While domestic travel for the fall season shows some recovery, a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in the United States and in many other countries have dampened the hopes of a near-term recovery for the industry. However gloomy it might look in the present time, the travel industry has the potential to pick up over the next few years, as vaccines are expected to arrive soon. In fact, the pandemic has forced operational changes in the industry to operate in the new normal.
