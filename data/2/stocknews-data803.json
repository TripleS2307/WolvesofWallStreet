Investors can buy stocks that have shown upward price movement, or short stocks that have demonstrated downward price movement. The theory of momentum investing is that these trends can continue for some time, so buying a stock that is trending upwards may reward you with continued upward price movement. There are numerous ways to approach momentum investing. Some traders follow a set of rules based on technical indicators such as moving averages, while other investors focus on price gains over a set period of time. While the strategy doesn\u2019t work in all market environments, it has been proven to provide returns above the market. For instance, the iShares Edge MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF (MTUM) has outperformed the SPDR 500 (SPY) over the past three months, the past year, and the past five years.
