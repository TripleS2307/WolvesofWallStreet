ADP is one of the top providers of cloud-based human resources administration. The company\u2019s solutions include payroll, talent management, and benefits administration. ADP has a strong business model with high recurring revenues, robust client retention, and low capital expenditures. Take a look at the 1-year chart of ADP below with my added notations: 7 \"SAFE HAVEN\" Dividend Stocks for Turbulent Times Chart of ADP provided by TradingView Over the past several months, a support level has formed in ADP at $130 (green). That line is also the \u201cneckline\u201d for the stock\u2019s head and shoulders reversal pattern. Above the neckline you can see the head and shoulder pattern itself (red) has almost been completed. Confirmation of the pattern would occur if ADP were to break the support, and lower prices would be expected from there. A head and shoulders pattern is a bearish setup. Therefore, a short trade could be entered on a break below the $130 level. Want to Discover More Great Trades?
