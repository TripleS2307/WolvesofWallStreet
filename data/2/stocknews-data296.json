UNM is a provider of group and individual income protection insurance products in the United States and the United Kingdom. UNM is the leading disability income writer and the second-largest writer of voluntary business in the United States. It has been benefiting from the acquisition of dental insurance businesses in the U.S. and U.K. Take a look at the 1-year chart of UNM below with my added notations: 9 \"BUY THE DIP\" Growth Stocks For 2020 Chart of UNM provided by TradingView The reason I expect this is because over the past four months, UNM has reached $20 three separate times, creating a level of resistance (red). In addition, the stock has been climbing a clear trendline of support (green). Together, these two lines have formed an ascending triangle pattern. It is likely that soon UNM will either trade over the $20 resistance level or fall under the trendline support. Therefore, a trader could buy UNM if the stock exceeds $20, with an assumption of a breakout. Or short UNM if it falls under the trendline support, with the assumption of a breakdown.
