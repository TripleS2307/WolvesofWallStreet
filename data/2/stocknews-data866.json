The common link between them is that their businesses are dependent on in-store spending, and they don\u2019t have a meaningful online presence. Another factor is that they appeal to the middle class which has been shrinking over the last couple of decades, while retailers focused on the upper and lower-end have done better. They were already having a hard time as traffic to retail stores was decreasing, and online spending was exploding. Further, younger people are much more likely to browse online rather than wander around a mall. 7 \"SAFE HAVEN\" Dividend Stocks for Turbulent TimesThe coronavirus is a negative shock to these businesses that were already in a secular decline.
