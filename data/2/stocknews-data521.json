Incredibly, this was the best 100 day performance for the stock market since 1933. Leading this rally were growth stocks. Growth stocks are companies that are expected to grow sales and earnings more quickly than stock market averages. So it\u2019s not surprising that the SPDR S&P 500 Growth ETF (SPYG) was up 58.6% in the 100 trading days since March 23rd and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) was up \u201conly\u201d 51%. Growth stocks have a high P/E (price-to-earnings) ratio because they are expected to grow rapidly. Historically, the average P/E for the S&P 500 is about 15. But It\u2019s common to see growth stocks often have a P/E ratio of 50, 100, or even higher. 7 \"SAFE HAVEN\" Dividend Stocks for Turbulent TimesHowever, currently, the P/E for many growth stocks are extremely high; Zoom Communication\u2019s (ZM) P/E is 1,470, Tesla\u2019s (TSLA) P/E is 944, and Freshpet\u2019s (FRPT) P/E is 930.
