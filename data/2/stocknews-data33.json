Despite the economic weakness, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained 22.5% and the S&P 500 returned 25.7% in the past six months. While there\u2019s disagreement about the exact reasons behind the booming stock market, most analysts expect the market to continue higher in 2021. The major drivers of the economic recovery are the reopening of businesses, resumption of normal economic activity, and government stimulus. Both monetary and fiscal stimulus will likely be deployed if the economy encounters any rough patches. The biggest gainers are expected to be the technology, healthcare, housing, and consumer packaged goods industries.
