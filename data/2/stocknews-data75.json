CMCSA is a worldwide media and tech behemoth highlighted by Comcast Cable and NBC Universal. CMCSA had nearly $110 billion in revenue in 2019. Cable Communications account for more than half of CMCSA\u2019s annual revenue. These communications consist of high-speed internet, video, and automation services.

Though investors might take some profits off the table in the weeks ahead following the stock\u2019s rapid ascension, this stock is still worth holding for the long haul. CMCSA\u2019s dividend of 2% is the icing on the cake. Unilever NV (UN) There is no shame in shifting some of your tech dollars to value stocks that pay dividends. UN is one such stock. UN\u2019s current dividend is more than 3%. UN is one of the leading consumer product businesses in the world. It makes all sorts of personal care products, home products, food and more. Examples of UN product lines include Lipton, Rama, and Dove. Though few know it, UN is one of the top frozen food producers in all of Europe.
