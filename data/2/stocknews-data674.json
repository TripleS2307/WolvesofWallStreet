These companies are typically regulated by the state and federal government. These services are essential for everyday life, so utility stocks have historically provided stable earnings. Reliable earnings allow a company to pay above-average dividends. Utility stocks are defensive in nature since people need water, gas, and electricity. The sector should do well in the recession brought on by the novel coronavirus. One thing that investors typically don\u2019t associate with utility stocks is very high earnings per share (EPS). But investing in growth stocks can help your portfolio. Growing businesses tend to rise in price. Investors can take advantage of both the share growth and income from dividends.
