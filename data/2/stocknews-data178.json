Overall POWR Rating: A (Strong Buy) Overall, ZM is rated a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d due to its impressive quarterly performance, growing user base, and solid price momentum, as determined by the four components of our overall POWR Rating. Bottom Line ZM has gained significantly so far this year and is a decent investment for investors looking for stability and growth in the long run. Global Covid-19 cases are still on the rise and some countries may impose further lockdowns or even bring back some earlier restrictions.
