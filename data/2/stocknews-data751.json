Many financial stocks are struggling due to the economy being weak, interest rates remaining low, and the pandemic clouding the economic outlook. However certain companies that are using technology to innovate, create value, and deliver solutions for their customers are thriving. Some well-known examples include digital payment processing, cashless transfers, cryptocurrencies, online mortgages, and banking services delivered online. These areas are going to keep growing in the coming years regardless of economic conditions. 7 \"SAFE HAVEN\" Dividend Stocks for Turbulent TimesHere are five financial services stocks that are innovating and should continue to gain market share in the future: Visa Inc. (V) Visa is continually investing in maintaining its position as the world\u2019s largest payment processor. It recently launched a digital tool named Advanced Identity Score which will help financial institutions fight against new accounts and synthetic fraud. This move could help V guard against almost $10 billion in losses and will also benefit consumers. V has launched the Visa Small Business Hub which is a platform that provides a range of services for smaller companies across twenty nations. This could further cement Visa\u2019s position as a market leader and help it compete with companies like Square (SQ), Paypal (PYPL), and Stripe. V is scheduled to announce its fiscal third-quarter 2020 results on July 28. While the consensus EPS and revenue estimates for the quarter indicate a year-over-year decline, V has a history of delivering earnings surprises. The company has beat consensus EPS estimates in three of the trailing four quarters. V\u2019s recent price performance reflects its ability to capitalize on the recent digitization of payments.
