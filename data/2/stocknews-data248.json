Though treatments have improved, so death rates are lower, the disease has paralyzed the world in many ways. Many countries\u2019 curves continue to rise, while countries such as Italy and Spain which had flattened the curve and reopened their economies are witnessing a second wave. With the health and macroeconomic repercussions of coronavirus, the demand for vaccines has risen more than ever. As of September 9th, almost 300 vaccines and drugs have reached phase IV of clinical trials.
