Sometimes, these MIN (Most Important numbers) lived up to the billing. But, mostly not. The item at hand changed from money supply to inflation date to employment rates. But all-in-all, the reaction was more of a knee-jerk than truly trend shifting \u2014 let alone mind-bending. The upcoming presidential election is now the next \u201cmost important event\u201d on the calendar and everyone is likely overplaying it as a crucial or lasting market driver.

As you can see, the VIX term structure has a large \u201celection\u201d hump that is priced for the event. But, isn\u2019t this election a closely contested binary choice between two starkly different world views and economic philosophies, complicated by fears about election integrity and a delayed outcome?

But one reason to believe the election is overplayed as a decisive and exploitable market swing factor is that investors always overplay elections, and they rarely prove to be instrumental inflection points for economic or market cycles. In order to treat an election as a specific catalyst for investment moves, one would have to handicap the result, anticipate Congress\u2019s makeup, intuit the key policy priorities, evaluate the likelihood of them becoming law, estimate their economic impact, and then determine how much of this decision tree has already been priced into financial markets. Sound doable? Think the prospect of capital-gains tax rate hikes with Biden as president would knee-cap stocks? Maybe there\u2019d be a flurry of front-loaded selling. But, capital gains tax increases in 1986 and 2013 didn\u2019t derail strong bull markets. And, famously, Wall Street wisdom had it wrong in 2016, when a Donald Trump win was viewed as dangerous for stocks. The SPY quickly reversed a 7% overnight loss and repriced for higher nominal growth, lower taxes, and less fiscal restraint. This set off a new bull market. One of the market\u2019s more identifiable patterns isn\u2019t how they react to elections, but how they behave leading up to them. From this standpoint, I\u2019d expect stocks to have a limited upside over the next few weeks. Given recent gains in the major indices and the unknowns regarding the election and how a potential second wave of COVID might play out, I\u2019d expect money managers to pull in their horns and take a defensive stance. This can be seen in the amount of hedging occurring in the options market. Even as indices and individual stocks pushed to new highs in August, the VIX and put/call ratio were providing readings suggesting that portfolio protection was firmly in place. For my part, I\u2019ve been taking advantage of the pumped-up premium by establishing credit spreads and iron condors in names such as \u201cIBM (IBM)\u201d and the QQQ, which I will close before the election date.
