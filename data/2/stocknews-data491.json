(DKS) has been charging higher on the charts, up 42% year-over-year, and now sits at more than triple its mid-March lows. Even further, a few weeks ago the retail chain announced the grand opening of 11 stores throughout nine states by the end of August, subsequently landing no fewer than four bull notes from analysts. And despite already sporting a 3% gain to trade near $46.26 this afternoon, even more upside could be on the horizon. Digging deeper, data from Schaeffer\u2019s Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White shows that DKS just came within one standard deviation of its 40-day moving average. Per White, three similar signals have occurred during the past three years. Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods stock was higher one month after 67% of these signals, averaging a one-month return of 9.4%. A similar move, from the security\u2019s current perch, would put DKS back above the $50 mark \u2014 territory not seen since April 2017. 7 Best ETFs for the NEXT Bull Market In terms of analyst sentiment, it\u2019s looking like the retail giant is overdue for a fresh round of upgrades and/or price-target hikes.
