These are companies that increase their revenue and earnings at a faster rate than the market average. Hence, they often trade at premium valuations. In fact, it makes sense to many investors to pay this premium considering their future growth potential that can help them beat the market. Growth stocks have historically outperformed value stocks as well as the broader market. In the last five years, the SPDR Series Trust SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Growth ETF (SPYG) has gained 128.8%. In comparison, the SPDR Series Trust SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Value ETF (SPYV) grew merely 50% and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) has returned 90.7% over the same time period. So, if you can get high-potential growth stocks at a discount due to headwinds that are temporary in nature, that\u2019s probably an opportunity you should not miss. This is perhaps that time, as the market witnessed a massive correction last month, leading some solid growth stocks to trade at a discount. 7 Best ETFs for the NEXT Bull MarketHere are four high-growth stocks that are currently trading at a discount: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA), Plug Power Inc.
