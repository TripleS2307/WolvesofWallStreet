Defense spending in the US has risen every year, regardless of which party is in charge. Over the last decade, the US economy grew around 2.1% annually, while defense spending grew 5% annually. Global growth and defense spending figures are similar. So, it\u2019s interesting to note that the defense sector has been underperforming despite recessionary conditions. From the March lows, the S&P 500 is 46% higher, while the Dow Jones US Defense Index is 20% higher. 9 \"BUY THE DIP\" Growth Stocks For 2020This underperformance may be an opportunity for investors to gain exposure to this sector given that in the long-term, defense spending has steadily increased.

Furthermore, AVAV received orders worth $9.8 million as part of a three-year base contract from NATO Support and Procurement agency that involves services for Puma tactical, Wasp and Raven UAS.
