It\u2019s OK if you didn\u2019t \u2014 you wouldn\u2019t be alone. Few folks paid attention to gold\u2019s recent price explosion, which caught many of the \u201cexperts\u201d by surprise. 7 \"SAFE HAVEN\" Dividend Stocks for Turbulent TimesOnly some of us watched as a stealthy bull market crept into gold these last two years. As recently as September 2018, the price of gold was below $1,200 per ounce. It steadily climbed out of that hole to peak at $1,680 per ounce in March\u2026 only to plunge 12% in just 10 days. At that point, hardly anyone cared. That is, until it was clear that only bailouts could save the world\u2019s economies. Money printing, economic crises, and fear of inflation are like gasoline on a fire when it comes to gold prices. That\u2019s exactly what happened. Suddenly, at the height of the pandemic, no gold bullion was available. The yellow metal\u2019s price soared from $1,471 on March 19 to an all-time high of $2,063 per ounce on August 6. That\u2019s a 40% gain since March, and a 75% return in just two years. Meanwhile, the long-forgotten mining companies that produce gold are back in the spotlight, with gold and gold stocks making headlines all the time. Even big-time investors like Warren Buffett have started buying gold miners. The reason, as I laid out for you here, is that miners will soon cash in on these higher prices. Now, retail investors are looking at gold stocks, too. And the overwhelming question they have is: \u201cDid I miss it?\u201d My answer to you is: \u201cNo.\u201d Let me show you why\u2026 Gold\u2019s Price May Have Soared, But Mining Stocks Haven\u2019t Gold\u2019s recent move higher is comparable to its move from 2008 to 2011. Here\u2019s a chart showing the movement in gold over that time period. During that same period, the NYSE Gold Bugs Index (HUI) rose 320%. This index tracks major gold miners like Barrick Gold (GOLD) and Newmont Mining (NEM). As you can see on the following chart, in October 2008, HUI hit a low of 151 points before peaking in September 2011, at 635 points. As you can see on the following chart, in October 2008, HUI hit a low of 151 points before peaking in September 2011, at 635 points. Let\u2019s compare that activity to what\u2019s happened recently. Gold\u2019s price blew through its previous high, set back in 2011 (which you see in the highlighted part of the chart). Now, it seems poised to make a new all-time high within the next couple of years. Yet the Gold Bugs Index hasn\u2019t matched that move. Just take a look at this chart: As you can see, today the index is well below the 2011 high (highlighted on the chart). The truth is that most investors won\u2019t leave technology stocks or the tech-heavy Nasdaq. In fact, the bulk of the investment universe has ignored metal and mining stocks for years. While the major gold miners have moved higher, they\u2019re nowhere near their peak from 2011. And yet the price of gold is already above that point. This means that all of these gold miners will make a lot of money selling gold \u2014 something that hasn\u2019t happened in a decade. As next quarter\u2019s results trickle in, I expect gold miners to get much more attention than we\u2019ve seen so far. And the Gold Bugs Index could double this year. In other words, the gold miners\u2019 big move is still ahead of us. So there\u2019s still plenty of room for investors to make a ton of money off of them.
