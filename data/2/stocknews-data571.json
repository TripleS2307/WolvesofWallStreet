The SPDR S&P MIDCAP 400 ETF (MDY) is down 5%, while the SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) is up over 4% for the year. Over the last two months (June 8 to August 12), the MDY has lagged SPY as well. This leads me to believe that some mid-cap stocks are trading at low valuations. Mid-cap stocks are stocks that have market capitalizations between $2 billion and $10 billion. They are expected to grow faster than large caps but are deemed safer than small-cap stocks. In looking for undervalued mid-caps with explosive growth potential, I searched stocks with 3 to 5-year growth estimates over 20%. For valuation purposes, I only looked at stocks with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio under 15. 7 Best ETFs for the NEXT Bull MarketCombining growth and value can lead to finding stocks with significant price appreciation potential. As expected, two out of four of the stocks in my screen are in the energy sector. The energy sector has lagged the market due to low oil prices, but analysts believe that the energy sector will post near 20% revenue growth in 2021. Four mid-cap stocks that I believe are undervalued and offer strong growth potential are Parsley Energy (PE), Western Union (WU), Canadian Solar (CSIQ), and Diamondback Energy (FANG). Parsley Energy (PE) PE is an independent oil and gas producer in the United States that operates exclusively in the Permian Basin. The company drives growth through acquisitions and drilling in the Permian Basin spread across west Texas and New Mexico. PE owns approximately 190,000 acres in the Permian Basin, 148,500 acres in the Midland Basin, and 41,500 acres in the Delaware Basin. PE reached an agreement to acquire Jagged Peak Energy last October in an all-stock deal. The transaction, which was worth $1.8 billion, will help PE maintain a healthy balance sheet. The company reported earnings in August with an EPS of $0.03 compared with the average estimate of -$0.14. PE also lowered its current liabilities to $613 million from $958 million in the previous quarter. PE\u2019s should maintain steady growth in the future due to its operations in the Permian Basin. The company has a 3 to 5-year EPS growth estimate of 36.53% and a trailing twelve-month P/E of 13.19. From a valuation perspective, the company is also undervalued through two different lenses. The stock is trading around $12, and Simply Wall St. set a fair value of $12.31 on the stock based on discounted cash flow analysis. According to TipRanks, the average analyst price target is $15. Western Union (WU) WU provides domestic and international money transfers through its global network of approximately 550,000 outside agents. It is the largest money transfer company in the world, with digital send capabilities in over 70 countries and bank account payout capabilities in over 100 markets. The company\u2019s business is split into three segments: Consumer-to-Consumer, which transfers money between consumers, Business Solutions, which facilitates payments between small and medium-sized companies, and Other, which consists of bill payments in the U.S. and in Argentina. WU sold off its Speedpay business and its Paymap mortgage payments services business. The company can now stay focused on cross-border services for consumers, financial companies, banks, and other businesses. The company has also benefited through the growth of its digital platform. This includes westernunion.com and Mobile Money Transfer. They are WU\u2019s fastest-growing business segment in terms of adding new customers and increasing business. WU has implemented a cost-cutting initiative to improve efficiency, profitability, and revenue growth. The company expects $50 million in annual savings for 2020, $100 million for 2021, and $150 million by 2022. The company has a long-term growth estimate of 25.77% and a trailing P/E of 13.59.
