There\u2019s increasing uncertainty with data showing the economy\u2019s momentum is stalling and uncertainty with the upcoming election. Given these conditions, dividend-paying stocks are one interesting option, because they would outperform in a bear market. Additionally, they are attractive on a valuation level as the spreads between yields and treasuries are close to a historical extreme. 9 \"BUY THE DIP\" Growth Stocks For 2020However, the pandemic has caused many dividend-paying companies to cut their dividends. In the second quarter of 2020, the number of stocks cutting dividends increased by 931% year-over-year to 639. While many stocks will maintain their dividend payments, if your goal is to ensure a dividend income, you may explore some ETFs that offer high dividend yields. ETFs are composed of a basket of stocks so there\u2019s much less risk. The iShares Broad USD High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (USHY), Invesco Financial Preferred ETF (PGF), iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG), and Invesco Preferred ETF (PGX) are four ETFs paying above-average yields. iShares Broad USD High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (USHY) USHY\u2019s goal is to track the investment results of ICE BofA US High Yield Constrained Index which is composed of U.S. dollar-denominated high yield corporate bonds. There may be a risk exposure attached to the corporate bonds in regions outside the U.S such as Japan, U.K., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, and the eurozone. The fund is non-diversified and invests at least 90% of its assets in component securities of the index and up to 10% of its assets in futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, and securities outside the index. USHY can substantiate portfolios of investors focused on fixed incomes and solid performance. Some of its top holdings are BLK CSH FND TREASURY SL AGENCY, ALTICE FRANCE SA (FRANCE) 144A, SPRINT CORP, and TRANSDIGM INC 144A. USHY pays an annual dividend of $2.24 which yields 5.65%. The ETF has gained more than 20% since its March low. The fund has returned 8.6% over the past six months and 4.8% over the past three months. The expenses ratio for USHY of 0.15% is lower than its category average of 0.49%, which makes it a reasonable option to invest in.
