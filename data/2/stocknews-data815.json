However, the longer-term fundamentals of the sector are positive as well given the aging population in the developing world. Due to this, spending on drugs and treatments is increasing every year which creates a huge, potential market for pharmaceutical companies. The companies in the sector are also benefiting from breakthroughs that have significantly lowered the cost of developing new drugs and increased their chances of success. 9 \"BUY THE DIP\" Growth Stocks For 2020Here are the three most popular pharmaceutical stocks on the Robinhood 100: Inovio Pharmaceuticals (INO) INO has been one of the frontrunners in the race to find a Covid-19 vaccine.

INO also reported positive results when they tested the vaccine in animals. However, INO did not mention the number of participants that generated neutralizing antibodies which concerned a few investors. The company still plans to carry on with the next phase in the summer. INO is a part of Operation Warp Speed and signed a $71 million contract with the US Department of Defense to increase its manufacturing capabilities. Its encouraging early trial results and $71 million deal in June caused the stock to soar and hit a 52-week high of $33.79 in late-June. INO also has other candidates in its pipeline such as VGX-3100 for precancerous cervical dysplasia and INO-5401 for glioblastoma multiforme.
