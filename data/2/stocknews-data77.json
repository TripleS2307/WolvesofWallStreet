What\u2019s more, these high-yield closed-end funds (CEFs) deliver these rich payouts monthly. We can thank the recent selloff for this opportunity. It\u2019s weighed on these CEFs\u2019 prices, tweaking their yields higher. With a 10.6% payout, you can get a yearly dividend stream of $40,000 on just a $378,000 investment. If you went with an index fund like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) or Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), which both yield 1.7% as I write this, you\u2019d have to invest $2.4 million to get the same payout! 7 Best ETFs for the NEXT Bull Market Source: CEF Insider You might wonder how CEFs can yield six times as much as the index funds most investors buy. It\u2019s actually not as radical as you might think: CEFs fuel their huge dividends by purchasing the same kinds of assets index funds do (including large cap stocks, corporate bonds and real estate investment trusts, or REITs). But instead of being run by algorithms, as ETFs are, CEFs have human managers who optimize their portfolios, buying and selling to create a cash flow they can pass on to investors. CEFs also tend to employ some leverage to enhance their returns. That\u2019s a particularly effective strategy today, with interest rates essentially at zero. Another trick up CEFs\u2019 sleeve: a focus on high-yield assets. Many CEFs specialize in corporate bonds, REITs and high-dividend stocks, so they\u2019re naturally set up to capture some of the biggest payouts on the market and pass them on to investors. Does this mean they sacrifice performance for income? Sure, some CEFs do. But there are many CEFs that have outperformed their benchmark index for many years. One pick in the portfolio of my CEF Insider service, for example, has posted a total return that\u2019s beaten that of the S&P 500 by a margin of nearly 50% over the past five years! That\u2019s just one example, and there are plenty of others. And because of their large dividends (the CEF Insider portfolio boasts an 8% average yield today), CEFs deliver most of their returns in cash. A 4-Fund Portfolio for 10.6% Income So how can we create a CEF portfolio that will maximize our income-earning potential? This simple four-fund portfolio is a good way to start: Ticker Fund Name Dividend Yield Dividend Frequency PFL PIMCO Income Strategy Fund 10.7% Monthly PFN PIMCO Income Strategy Fund II 10.6% Monthly AWP Alpine Global Premier Properties Fund 10.5% Monthly CHW Calamos Global Dynamic Income Fund 10.6% Monthly These four funds typically yield between 8% and 11%, depending on market sentiment. Today, their yields are almost uniform, at around 10.6%. Put them together and, with less than a $400,000 investment, you\u2019ve got a monthly income stream of around $3,500. These four funds also hand us some nice diversification, too. PFL and PFN are both managed by bond experts at PIMCO, a leading firm in the CEF world, who use their unique market position to get the best corporate bonds and other assets in the credit market. Alpine Global has an inconsistent track record, but in the last couple years, a new management team has turned AWP around by making some timely REIT picks. Among its top holdings are warehouse landlord Prologis (PLD), which benefits from rising e-commerce; data-center owner Equinix (EQIX) and cell-tower REIT American Tower (AMT), both of which profit from the work-at-home shift; and Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE), whose life-science and technology research facilities are also in high demand. Meanwhile, CHW gives you exposure to large-cap stocks from the US and around the world. Top-10 holdings include the Walt Disney Co. (DIS) and Microsoft (MSFT), as well as Chinese tech giants Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) and Alibaba Group (BABA). And no, investors haven\u2019t had to sacrifice performance for yield with these four funds. Source: CEF Insider While AWP\u2019s annualized 5.8% total return is on the low side, that\u2019s due to the underperforming management I mentioned a second ago (that\u2019s no longer with the fund). The other three funds have delivered an impressive 9.2% annualized return between them over a decade. There\u2019s only one hitch with these funds: they\u2019re still not quite cheap enough for my taste today. Let me explain. Unlike ETFs, which tend to trade at the net asset value (NAV) of their portfolios, CEFs will often trade higher than their NAV or at discounts to their NAV. Right now, PFL and PFN trade at modest premiums, while CHW\u2019s 3.6% discount is dwarfed by a big sale at AWP. Prices Vary for CEFs AWP\u2019s discount is compelling, as investors haven\u2019t fully realized that the fund\u2019s management shakeup has improved its quality. But premiums are rarely worth paying in the CEF world, while the 3.6% discount at CHW is pretty small: the average discount in CEFs is currently 7.5%. The bottom line? AWP has the most upside of these four funds right now. But don\u2019t dismiss the others; if you\u2019re looking for a high monthly income stream, they\u2019re still worth considering. Even better if you put them on your watch list and wait for wider discounts (or the disappearance of premiums, in the cases of PFL and PFN). Want More Great Investing Ideas?
