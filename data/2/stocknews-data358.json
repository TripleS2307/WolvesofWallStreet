Many investors are jumping on the bandwagon and buying stocks, even though they look expensive. In a way, betting on a soaring stock is considered momentum investing. But in the absence of strong economic news, there is a chance these stocks will see a correction. Although I am not against momentum investing, investing in stocks that are available at relatively cheaper prices could increase the odds of success. For this strategy, just a low price is not enough. You need to choose low-priced stocks that have solid growth potential. Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
