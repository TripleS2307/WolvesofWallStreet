Semiconductors are crystals made up of materials such as silicon. Because they have a unique structure that allows conductivity to be controlled through stimulation such as electric currents, they can amplify and produce light from electricity. This is useful in the manufacturing of electronic devices. During the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, semiconductors stocks plummeted. The iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) fell 34% from February 19th to March 20th. The market feared the pandemic would destroy demand in semiconductors, but it turns out that the demand in the cloud market from work from home activities, increased demand in semiconductors. That demand should continue as long as the pandemic grips the globe. There are many different sizes of semiconductor stocks. For instance, a mid-cap stock typically has a market capitalization or value between $2 and $10 billion. These stocks are typically in the middle of the growth curve so that investors can take advantage of their growth prospects without the increased risks of small-cap stocks. 7 Best ETFs for the NEXT Bull MarketHere are three mid-cap semiconductor stocks that are almost near their 52-week highs: IPG Photonics Corporation (IPGP) IPGP manufactures high power fiber lasers and amplifiers used in material processing and diverse applications. This $9.3-billion stock has been performing pretty well in the \u201cnew normal\u201d environment and hit its 52-week high of $176.73 last Friday. It has added approximately 70% to its stock price since its April lows. IPGP\u2019s impressive price momentum could be an indication of bullish trends in the coming months. The recent events have been encouraging enough for investors. IPGP recently announced the new YLR-U series near-infrared 1 \u03bcm fiber lasers, which has a record power to volume ratio. The company\u2019s Senior Vice President of Worldwide Sales and Marketing Trevor Ness commented on this new fiber laser series that, \u201cWith the launch of our new ultra-compact YLR-U Series, IPG is once again raising the bar for leading-edge performance in the industrial laser sector. These solutions provide the best customer value proposition on the market bar none.\u201d IPGP surpassed the consensus EPS estimate for the first quarter by 257.9%, and its earnings are expected to grow 13.6% annually over the next five years.

(BRKS) BRKS, which has a market cap of $3.3 billion, is a provider of semiconductor manufacturing solutions and life science sample-based solutions worldwide. There has been a surge in demand for life science products required for Covid-19-related research.

The company\u2019s diversified revenue streams have helped accelerate its revenue growth since 2018. BRKS is approaching its 52-week high and has recovered more than 74% since hitting its 52-week low in mid-March due to the overall dip in the market.
