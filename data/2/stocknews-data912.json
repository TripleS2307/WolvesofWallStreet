(MSM) since the end of May. MSM distributes metalworking and maintenance, repair, and operations products in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the United Kingdom. A horizontal channel occurs when an asset\u2019s, in this case a stock, price is ranging within a sideways support and resistance zone. Channels are used by technical analysts to identify areas where breakout trades could form. A breakout is when the price of an asset moves above a resistance level or below a support level. A breakout to the upside signals traders to buy the asset or cover short positions, while a breakout to the downside signals traders to get short or sell long positions. 9 \"BUY THE DIP\" Growth Stocks For 2020Let\u2019s take a look at the 1-year chart of MSM with added notations: Chart of MSM provided by TradingView After hitting its low in March, MSM rallied above $68 in late May. Since then, the stock has been fluctuating within a range. A support level has formed at $68 (green) and a resistance level at $75 (red). As I\u2019m writing this article, MSM is trading about $70, which is within the horizontal channel. There are two possible trades I am waiting patiently for: The stock moves higher, over the $75 resistance level. If/when that happens, a breakout to the upside could occur. The stock moves lower, under the $68 support level. If/when that happens, a breakout to the downside could occur. I will be keeping a close eye on MSM today because this morning it released its quarterly earnings report. MSM reported earnings of $1.40 per share, compared to earnings of $1.45 per share a year ago. The company posted revenues of $834.97 million for the quarter ended May 2020. Have a good trading day!
