E-commerce stocks were seeing gains before the pandemic started, but the closure of brick and mortar stores only accelerated this trend. It has fundamentally changed the shopping habits of consumers worldwide. Changes in shopping behavior are most likely permanent and will benefit e-commerce stocks for the foreseeable future. More companies will be focusing on online channels, in-store fulfillment, and curbside pickup. Here are three stocks that are experiencing significant e-commerce growth: 7 \"SAFE HAVEN\" Dividend Stocks for Turbulent TimesWalmart Inc.
