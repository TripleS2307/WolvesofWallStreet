The tech stocks have been down in three out of the past four trading sessions. The Nasdaq Composite index is down 9.4% since Sept 2, and the SPDR Technology ETF (XLK) is down 10.4% over the same period. Some of the biggest stocks that have benefited from the pandemic are seeing some of the most significant losses. For instance, Tesla (TSLA) is down 17% since last Wednesday. Investors may be wondering if it\u2019s time to pull out of tech stocks. While I don\u2019t believe the sector needs to be avoided altogether, I do think we need to be selective in which tech stocks we invest in. Some tech companies have great futures in front of them. At the same time, others should be avoided completely. While there were many stocks to choose from, I selected two stocks I believe have healthy fundamentals and a strong path to future growth, and two stocks with strong headwinds and a much murkier future. KLA (KLAC) and Synopsys (SNPS) are two stocks with great outlooks, and Xerox (XRX) and Sabre (SABR) are two stocks with I would avoid. 7 \"SAFE HAVEN\" Dividend Stocks for Turbulent TimesStocks to Buy KLA Corp.
