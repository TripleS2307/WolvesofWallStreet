The creation of the object is achieved using additive processes. This is where an object is created by laying down successive layers of material until it is formed. 3D printing brings an array of benefits that traditional printing does not offer. The first is customization. 3D printing can provide the ability to personalize products to individual needs. 3D printing also allows for complex printing. This has had a meaningful impact on industrial applications. The technology is also emerging as energy efficient. The process utilizes up to 90% of standard materials, which reduces waste. The coronavirus has had a significant impact on the manufacturing business. Many companies have had to close factories and lay off employees to stop the spread of the virus. This is where 3D is needed. There has been a rise in the demand for specialized medical products, and 3D printers help manufactures create those products. 7 \"SAFE HAVEN\" Dividend Stocks for Turbulent TimesThe ExOne Company (XONE), Proto Labs (PRLB), and Materialise (MTLS) are three 3D printing companies investors should consider buying now.
