Though the company beat earnings estimates, their earnings guidance was lighter than expected. More importantly, INTC also announced a 6 month delay for the release of their 7nm-based CPU chips, which sports tiny 7-nanometer transistors with increased performance. This caused shares of INTC to plummet 16% last Friday and the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) to fall 4%. 7 \"SAFE HAVEN\" Dividend Stocks for Turbulent TimesHowever, not all semiconductor stocks are underperforming. Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and NVIDIA (NVDA) are trading higher than they were before INTC reported earnings last week. Here are the reasons why these three semiconductor stocks are outperforming the rest of the sector: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (TSM) Intel\u2019s manufacturing setback of its 7 nanometer chips has given TSM the momentum to outpace its industry peers. Intel\u2019s delay is a blessing for TSM, as it could gain a larger slice of the pie in terms of market share. Wendell Huang, VP and Chief Financial Officer of TSMC said, \u201cMoving into third quarter 2020, we expect our business to be supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 5nm and 7nm technologies, driven by 5G smartphones, HPC and IoT-related applications.\u201d So, the near future seems encouraging for potential investors. Since its March lows, TSM has gained more than 75%. The consensus EPS estimate of $0.77 for the current quarter indicates a year-over-year increase of 24.2%. The revenue estimate of $11.6 billion also indicates an increase of 23.5% over the year-ago quarter. TSM has an impressive earnings surprise history with the company beating consensus EPS estimates in three of the past four quarters. In the second quarter, revenue increased 28.9% and net income increased 81% year over year. How does TSM stack up for the POWR Ratings?

The stock is also ranked #1 out of 86 stocks in the Semiconductor & Wireless Chip industry. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) AMD recently announced the 7nm x86 desktop processors with built in graphics for consumer and commercial PC markets. The AMD 4000 Series and AMD Athlon 3000 Series Desktop Processors with Radeon graphics demonstrate advanced processor core technology.

AMD has been showing a bullish trend and is up by more than 75% from its March lows. The consensus EPS estimate of $0.16 for the quarter ended June 2020 indicates a year-over-year increase of 100%. The revenue estimate of $1.86 billion also indicates an increase of 21.5% over the year-ago quarter. In the first quarter, revenue was up 40% year over year and EPS was up by $0.12.
