The iPath Series B Bloomberg Copper Subindex Total Return ETN\u2019s (JJC) is up 35% from its March lows and is 10% above their pre-coronavirus highs. This is contrary to expectations as most investors expected that economic weakness would persist and hurt commodities like copper. Instead, the industrial economy has been quite strong and rebounded faster than other segments. In part, it\u2019s due to the quicker recovery in China, and its government\u2019s aggressive investment efforts. Demand for copper is expected to remain strong into the year-end as more economies continue recovering. Leading indicators for global economic data are also showing that New Orders are increasing, while inventories are low. In the US, the strong housing market will also lead to more copper demand. 9 \"BUY THE DIP\" Growth Stocks For 2020According to the Gordon Brothers Copper Industry Insight, worldwide demand is expected to grow 2.6% annually through 2027 based on the expected growth of the electric vehicle market and the Chinese power and infrastructure sectors.
