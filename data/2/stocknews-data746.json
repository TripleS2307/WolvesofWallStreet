Specifically, there\u2019s a shortage of nickel, which is a key ingredient in Tesla\u2019s batteries. On the conference call, Musk pleaded, \u201cany mining companies out there, please mine more nickel. Okay. Wherever you are in the world, please mine more nickel\u2026Tesla will give you a giant contract for a long period of time if you mine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally sensitive way. So hopefully this message goes out to all mining companies. Please get nickel.\u201d Musk is looking to secure nickel supply for his batteries because he understands that demand is going to increase over the coming decade as electric vehicles (EV) start taking greater market share. By 2030, sales of electric vehicles are expected to be higher than gas-powered vehicles. 9 \"BUY THE DIP\" Growth Stocks For 2020 Over the past two years, nickel prices have declined from $8 per lb. to $6 per lb, but the long-term fundamentals remain solid given the growth of the EV market.
