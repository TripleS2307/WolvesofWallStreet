When 2020 started grinding the world to a halt, some thought the time had come for value stocks to get their deserved attention. However, that hasn\u2019t happened, and even during 2020, investor\u2019s bent towards growth stocks has been quite prominent. The record-setting rally of the stock market post mid-March, has made it difficult for investors to find undervalued stocks, as the market\u2019s rally sent prices of most stocks higher. However, the sell-off in September, due to investors\u2019 concerns over stalled fiscal stimulus talks, the upcoming election, and new coronavirus cases in Europe, has opened the door to find value. Even if the correction doesn\u2019t last long, the market is expected to remain volatile over the coming months. So, only considering stocks trading at attractive prices could prove risky. Looking for value stocks that also have a dividend yield, can reduce some of your risk. While a value stock could provide solid price appreciation over the long run, a dividend can help ensure steady income. 9 \"BUY THE DIP\" Growth Stocks For 2020Verizon Communications Inc.
