Tech stocks have been receiving most of the attention lately from investors, as the sector has skyrocketed since March 23rd. However, there are a number of undervalued stocks that are being ignored and that could see a significant rebound in the second half of 2020. 7 \"SAFE HAVEN\" Dividend Stocks for Turbulent TimesTo find the best undervalued stocks, I focused on three metrics: I only looked at stocks that have a year-over-year quarterly EPS growth rate of over 25%. I narrowed down that list by considering stocks with a trailing 12-month price/earnings ratio of 15 or under and a Price/Earnings to Growth ratio of under one. This resulted in a list of 150 stocks. I then selected three stocks that had a Buy rating or higher in the exclusive StockNews POWR Ratings system. Here are my favorite three undervalued stocks with high growth potential for the remainder of 2020: BHP Group (BHP) BHP is a leading global diversified miner supplying iron ore, copper, oil, gas, and metallurgic coal.

The company has affirmed its production and cost guidance for its fiscal year 2020, even with the ongoing pandemic. BHP has been focusing on lowering its debt and improving its cash flow, which should bode well during these turbulent times.
