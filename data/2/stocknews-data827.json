The latest POWR Ratings upgrades reveal the following stocks might be poised for positive gains: The Progressive Corporation (PGR ), Zillow Group (Z), PetIQ (PETQ), and The York Water Company (YORW). The Progressive Corporation (PGR) 9 \"BUY THE DIP\" Growth Stocks For 2020Some investors have shied away from insurance stocks during the pandemic due to a fear of force majeure clauses. A force majeure clause is a contractual provision that excuses one or both parties\u2019 performance obligations when circumstances arise beyond the parties\u2019 control. PGR strictly provides auto and commercial property insurance, meaning it will not lose money due to force majeure clauses that might occur with other insurance providers. Though PGR\u2019s advertisements featuring the seemingly ubiquitous Flo character annoy some, the stock was recently upgraded in our POWR Ratings system for a good reason. PGR is now ranked #1 of nearly 60 businesses in the Insurance \u2013 Property & Casualty industry, highlighted by A grades in each of the four POWR Components except for Industry Rank. The average analyst price target for PGR is $91.25. Five analysts recommend buying PGR, while three recommend holding the stock, and none advise selling. PGR has a year-to-date price return of 21.71% on top of a return of 25.14% last year. Zillow Group (Z) Interest rates are at an all-time low.

PetIQ Inc. (PETQ) No matter how bad the economy gets, pet owners will still spend money on their fur buddies. PETQ provides pet medication and wellness solutions through retail stores and e-commerce channels. The POWR Ratings show PETQ has As in all categories except for Industry Rank.
