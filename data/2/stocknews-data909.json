Though consumer spending has been impacted by the coronavirus, tech spending has increased due to the shift to remote work and school from home. This is on top of the already secular shift towards increased spending on the cloud and software-as-a-service. All tech spending eventually flows to semiconductors, as computer chips are a foundational part. If your portfolio does not have at least one semiconductor stock, it is time to add one \u2013 or several. Let\u2019s take a look at four of the more intriguing semiconductor stocks: Broadcom (AVGO), Analog Devices (ADI), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), and Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM).

The analysts have set a price target of $353.04 for AVGO, indicating there is still 13% above the current price. With a forward P/E ratio of 14.55, AVGO provides fantastic value for a tech stock in a hot segment.

Further, NXPI has exposure to new offerings in emerging spaces such as autonomous vehicles, the internet of things (IoT), and mobile wallets. The POWR Ratings have NXPI ranked 30th of 86 stocks in the Semiconductor & Wireless Chip space with a \u201cB\u201d Trade Grade and an \u201cA\u201d for Industry Rank.
