With virtual working and learning now becoming the new normal, working mothers have revealed the strains of taking care of their children and balancing a career. This has resulted in plenty of women leaving the workforce permanently. Though reopening of schools might act as a boon for such households, it does not come without risks. As the number of coronavirus cases are rising with each passing day, sending kids to school without proper vaccination could be risky. On the other hand, there are limitations to virtual learning from reduced efficiency to technological limitations. Several education providers such as Bright Horizons Family Solutions, Inc. (BFAM), Aspen Group, Inc. (ASPU), and Rosetta Stone, Inc. (RST) are actively working to resolve the problems associated with remote learning, and have launched various products and services to help.
