Some sectors like technology and housing are making new highs, while others that remain impaired by the coronavirus are 50% off previous highs. It\u2019s a challenging situation for investors. Either buy stocks whose fate is dependent on the health situation improving or chase stocks that are at high multiples. One solution is to look at ETFs which have outperformed and are paying dividends. Dividends guarantee some income from the position and would also be a tailwind if interest rates were to fall further due to the economic or health situation deteriorating. On the other hand, if the recovery continues, the companies in the ETF would earn more and fuel more gains. ETFs also eliminate any sort of single-stock risk that can come from a poor earnings report or corporate misstep. 7 \"SAFE HAVEN\" Dividend Stocks for Turbulent TimesFive dividend-paying ETFs that stand out for their exceptional performance are SPDR Select Sector Fund \u2013 Technology (XLK), VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH), Global X Silver Miners ETF (SIL), ARK Genomic Revolution ETF (ARKG) and iShares S&P Global Clean Energy Index Fund (ICLN).
