This allows a company to raise money (or capital) from public investors. It also allows public investors to take part in the offering. The IPO provides the company an opportunity to grow and expand. While the main reason for an IPO is to raise capital, there are also other reasons for a company to consider. An IPO establishes a public value on a company that may want to be acquired at some point. It can also help a company get better credit terms due to the transparency that comes with quarterly reporting. A company can also attract better employees due to the prestige of being public. In the past year and a half we\u2019ve seen a number of high-profile companies IPO, such as: UBER (UBER), LYFT (LYFT), Zoom Coomunications (ZM), and Moderna (MRNA). 7 Best ETFs for the NEXT Bull MarketMany IPOs have been performing very well. This is evident by looking at the Renaissance IPO ETF (IPO) which is up 31% over the past year. This ETF captures the returns from IPOs by adding them to their index at the end of their fifth day of trading and removing them after 500 trading days. Here are the 4 best performing IPOs so far in 2020: Schrondinger, Inc. (SDGR) SDGR is a material science and life sciences enterprise that focuses on developing software for computational chemistry.

It has partnered with Google Cloud, Takeda, Novartis, and others, to use its computational modeling systems to find a drug that can effectively target COVID-19 proteins. SDGR is disrupting traditional methods of drug discovery, which could lead to high gains for the stock in the future. In the quarter ended March 2020, the company recorded strong performance with a 26% year-over-year increase in revenue. The company also saw a 28% year-over-year increase in revenue from its software offering. SDGR has gained more than 175% since the stock started trading on February 6th.

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the company is expected to do well as it offers telemedicine options and virtual care. ONEM has recently announced a secondary offering of 8.3 million shares at a price that is more than double the IPO price on January 31, 2020. This could be a good indicator of the upside.
