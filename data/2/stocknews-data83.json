From the Covid-19 crisis to the September sell off, investors are apprehensive regarding the future performance of even blue-chip companies. The current sluggish economy and uncertainty related to the upcoming presidential election have added to this increasing precariousness. Many analysts have also expressed fears regarding the development of a budding asset bubble over the past few months similar to the dot-com bubble. Also, many countries have shown inclination towards potential de-globalization, which casts a shadow over the future of multinational companies. All these factors combined have sparked fears of a potential market crash in the upcoming months. Precious metals and government issued bonds have gained traction amid the sparking fears, primarily because of their safety features. However, direct investment in these instruments can be taxing, as storing precious metals often becomes challenging, while government bonds have to be resold over the counter, making them relatively illiquid. ETFs such as the SPDR Gold Trust ETF (GLD), iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG), iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (LQD), and the iShares TIPS Bond ETF (TIP) give investors the requisite exposure to these minimum-risk securities without any hassles. You may easily diversify your portfolio and hedge your investment risk by investing in these ETFs. 9 \"BUY THE DIP\" Growth Stocks For 2020SPDR Gold Trust ETF (GLD) GLD invests in physical gold bullions, which are stored in vaults.
