The company has seen a slower rollouts of retails stores in Canada and a delay in approval for derivative products. This has resulted in a year to date loss of 55% so far. Over the summer, HEXO sold its facility in Niagara, Ontario due to an excess of capacity and lowered demand. Making matters worse, the company has received a delisting notice from the NYSE. A minimum requirement for a company to remain listed on the NYSE is a share price of $1.00 USD. If the company fails to maintain this price, it will be notified about a potential delisting. The company would then need to provide a plan of action to regain compliance or they can simply move forward with the delisting. HEXO is currently trading at $0.71. One common fix for a company that faces delisting is a reverse stock split or a share consolidation. Aurora Cannabis (ACB) was the first major cannabis company to consolidate its shares in a 12:1 reverse stock split.
