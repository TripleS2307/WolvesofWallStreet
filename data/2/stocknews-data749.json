It may be the multi-decade run in healthcare spending. Dividend stocks that are providing products aligned with this megatrend have the types of payouts that we\u2019re looking for in a retirement portfolio: Secure cash flows, with Rising profits to support future dividend growth. At a time when we can no longer take dividend payments for granted, this type of \u201cmegatrend support\u201d is becoming a must-have. 7 \"SAFE HAVEN\" Dividend Stocks for Turbulent TimesWe\u2019ll talk about specific stocks in a minute. First, let\u2019s get into the trend and spend. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services provides estimates of US health care spending by sources of funds, such as private healthcare insurance, Medicare and so on. In this year\u2019s report, they project healthcare spending will continue to expand at a healthy clip of 5.4%: Regardless of who has political power, health spending just keeps growing and growing. As money flows into this sector, the rising tide is reflected in an ETF like the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV). It\u2019s up 339% over the past decade, beating S&P 500 by about 70 percentage points. Healthcare Beats the Market Rather than settle for the ETF, we can further enhance our returns by cherry-picking the best companies (and dividend payers) of the lot. Let\u2019s take a run through some of my favorite ideas, including likely \u201cdividend doubles\u201d\u2014stocks that don\u2019t yet pay a high stated yield but will thanks to rapid dividend growth. Big Pharma\u2019s Little Helper Don\u2019t be fooled by West Pharmaceuticals\u2019 (WST) modest 0.3% yield. A few months back we discussed it as one of three little-known dividend growers. I highlighted this undercover stock back in April. Since then, it\u2019s rocketed 55% higher: WST Becomes a Bit More \u201cKnown\u201d: +55% in Just 3 Months The firm is about as vanilla as they come, which is perfect for us level-minded dividend investors. West Pharmaceuticals creates the packaging for vital treatments, whether that\u2019s vials and stoppers, or more complex delivery systems such as self-injecting platforms, cartridges and intradermal products. As I said then: West Pharmaceuticals isn\u2019t going to create the first coronavirus vaccine. But it\u2019s entirely possible that a vaccine might come in a West Pharmaceuticals-made vial. Again, a boring business, but also an extremely vital one that will see demand no matter what. And the stock acts like it. A couple weeks later, West Pharmaceutical produced a wide earnings beat ($1.01 vs. $0.82 expected) thanks to a strong organic growth report. This is a stellar business, but the stock has entered some awfully thin air. Its share appreciation has lapped its dividend growth several times over, and shares now trade for more than 70 times forward earnings estimates. Markets never move in a straight line. This is a good one to consider on a pullback. You Can\u2019t Go Vertical Forever Two High-Potential Dividend Growers Like West Pharma, Agilent Technologies (A), which has a 0.8% yield, and Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO), which has a 0.2% yield, aren\u2019t responsible for front-line brand names you and I will know, but they\u2019re still making \u201cmust have\u201d products for the healthcare sector. Agilent, which was spun out from Hewlett-Packard back in 1999, is a full-service lab supplier, from products to software to services. It offers everything from cell analysis and next-gen sequencing to instrument repair and laboratory management. Thermo Fisher, meanwhile, has a laundry list of offerings, including DNA testing kits, centrifuges and cryogenics. They also boast similar stock profiles right now: encouraging dividend growth, conservative payout ratios (23% for A, a mere 7% for TMO), and (unfortunately) rich valuations. Great Returns, But Overbought at the Moment Agilent\u2019s trading at 27 times forward earnings estimates and Thermo Fisher, meanwhile, is sitting at a 31 forward P/E. These are very good companies, but they are trading at high levels at the moment. Current Pharma Dividends Up to 3.5% For income investors who need yield today, let\u2019s consider the established Big Pharma and Big Biotech names. Eli Lilly (LLY), which as a 1.8% yield, has many potential catalysts at the moment. For one, Eli\u2014behind products such as type 2 diabetes treatment Trulicity, plaque psoriasis medication Taltz and breast cancer drug Verzenio\u2014is coming off a standout Q1. LLY reported 15% sales growth and actually raised its profit outlook for 2020 while most other companies were pulling their guidance. It also spent the quarter taking several steps in examining several existing products to treat or prevent COVID-19. Eli Lilly, which was actually booted from the Dividend Aristocrats in 2009 after freezing its payout, resumed dividend growth in 2015 and has since boosted its quarterly checks by 48%. The payout ratio is a safe 43%, so investors can expect good (but probably not spectacular) hikes in the coming years. Here, too, LLY has gotten a little away from itself, and away from its dividend growth. Its forward P/E of 25 is a bit rich for a slow grower like Lilly. Lilly\u2019s Price Overshot Its Payout Unlike these other healthcare plays, an expensive price is not an issue with Gilead Sciences (GILD), which has a 3.5% yield. Shares are due to \u201ccatch up\u201d with its dividend, which has been raised every year while the stock price has done nothing: Gilead\u2019s Price Should Catch up With Its Payout Gilead\u2014which develops antivirals for hepatitis B and C, HIV and influenza\u2014became a victim of its own success. It created blockbuster cures for hepatitis C, which was great for patients but bad for those drugs\u2019 business longer-term. GILD\u2019s 2019 revenues of $22.5 billion were off 30% from 2015 sales of $32.6 billion. But importantly, those sales were up from 2018, stopping years of declines. That improvement is expected to come from remdesivir, its COVID-19 treatment that has been granted emergency-use approval by the FDA. But it also has a lot of potential in its HIV franchise, including its investigative treatment lenacapavir, which has produced some positive data in recent months. GILD now trades at just 12 times forward estimates. It yields well above 3% on a payout that has expanded by nearly 60% over the past five years, and it\u2019s still only shelling out 41% of its profits to maintain that dividend.
