Some concerns are a possible second wave, failure to reach agreement on another stimulus package in a timely manner, and potential for a \u201ccontested\u201d election. Given these risks, it\u2019s understandable if investors are wary of initiating new positions in stocks. Single stocks have additional risk due to the potential for an earnings miss or some problem with operations that could lead to a significant decline in price. One potential solution is ETFs which give investors exposure to equities while spreading out the risk. ETFs have risen to be a popular investment instrument, as investors can hedge their portfolio for higher returns without undue risks.
