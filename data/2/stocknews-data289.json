It is known as the most reliable safe-haven asset, as it is easily redeemable in times of emergencies. So, the commodity typically has an inverse relationship with stock market performance. The more uncertain the stock market is, the more investors shift their investments to the yellow metal. Quite naturally, the economic and market slump caused by the pandemic helped gold soar this year, before taking a nosedive during the technology boom, which pushed stocks to abnormally high levels. The yellow metal hit its all-time high of $2,067 per ounce in early August, and is currently trading at $1,934, gaining more than 28% year-to-date. After taking a pause, the precious metal has resumed its rally and is well positioned to hit new highs with a recent increase in market volatility, the tech sell-off, a weakening US dollar, and a growing rift between the UK and the EU concerning Brexit. Investors are also turning to this safe-haven asset with expected uncertainty in the upcoming US presidential election. 9 \"BUY THE DIP\" Growth Stocks For 2020As companies that are engaged in the exploration and mining of this precious metal benefit directly from its rising prices, their stocks should gain significant momentum in the upcoming months.
