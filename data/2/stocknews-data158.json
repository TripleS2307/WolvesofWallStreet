The companies in this industry offer an assortment of goods from health supplements, beauty supplies, home d\u00e9cor, and more. Demand for such products is primarily driven by the disposable income of consumers and the industry has not been performing well amid the health crisis due to lower demand for most of the products. Overall POWR Rating: B (Buy) Overall, W is rated a \u201cBuy\u201d due to its impressive quarterly performance, strength in its fundamentals, and solid price momentum, as determined by the four components of our overall POWR Rating. Bottom Line The stock has soared so far this year, despite instances of profit bookings. W was able to meet the pandemic-driven accelerated demand and retain its customers. Hence, it is well-positioned for long-term growth. However, the company is facing immense competition from traditional retailers such as Amazon.com (AMZN), which already has a 30% share of the online furniture market. Even so, with the scale of revenue and profit growth, W has the potential to grow even further based on its favorable earnings and price momentum. Analyst sentiment, which gives a good sense of a stock\u2019s future price movement, is pretty impressive for W. The average broker rating of 1.79 indicates a favorable analyst sentiment. The market expects EPS for the ongoing year to rise 131% from the year-ago value. This outlook should keep W\u2019s price momentum alive in the near term.
