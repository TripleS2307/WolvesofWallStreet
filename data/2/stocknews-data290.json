The DJIA has a negative year-to-date return as the index\u2019s components are primarily major industrial and financial stocks that were heavily affected by the COVID-led economic downturn. However, the DJIA has displayed a solid recovery since the market crash in mid-March, and investors now expect less fluctuation in the index after its recent reorganization. The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA) presently has a dividend yield of 2.14% but it\u2019s worth exploring top Dow dividend payers separately from the broader index. Home Depot, Inc. (HD), Coca-Cola Company (KO), International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), and Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS) are four such fundamentally sound DJIA stocks that could be a steady source of income for you. 7 \"SAFE HAVEN\" Dividend Stocks for Turbulent TimesHome Depot, Inc.
