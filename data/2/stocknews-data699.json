It\u2019s been the strongest index in terms of its gains off the lows and it\u2019s at new, all-time highs. In contrast, the Dow (DIA) and S&P 500 (SPY) haven\u2019t yet made new, all-time highs. Given the rally\u2019s steep incline, there have been few low-risk entry points. Therefore, the price action in July is noteworthy in that the index\u2019s ascent has paused and formed a double bottom around 10,200. For anyone who thinks the rally still has legs, it\u2019s creating an interesting, entry point. One of the best ways to get exposure to technology is through ETFs.
