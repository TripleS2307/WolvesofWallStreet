This is an increase of 145% from June 2019, and it\u2019s the second-highest ever other than March of this year when 2.5 million were sold. April and May were also strong with 1.7 million and 1.8 million sold, respectively. March\u2019s sales were due to the coronavirus and the shutdowns. Gun sales remained strong as they tend to be during periods of economic stress. However as political tensions increased, they saw another surge. Gun stocks tend to outperform during this climate whether it\u2019s for hunting or self-defense. For portfolios, they are also a source of diversification given that they tend to trade independently from the broader market. 7 \"SAFE HAVEN\" Dividend Stocks for Turbulent TimesWe have identified two gun stocks with attractive fundamentals.
