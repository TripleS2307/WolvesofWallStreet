With so many outlets for spending not available, people have more time and money to spend on upgrading their homes. Additionally, there\u2019s been an increase in demand for homes, while supply remains low. Another factor is low mortgage rates. According to Bankrate\u2019s weekly survey of large lenders, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate fell to a new record low of 3.05% last week. This is no doubt encouraging for home buyers. Increasing home prices also leads to increased economic confidence and greater spending on home improvement projects.
