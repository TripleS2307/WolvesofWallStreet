This is evident from the Russell 2000 index\u2019s 39% gain since mid-March, compared to the S&P 500\u2019s gain of 34%. There is always a risk associated with investing in small-cap stocks as they tend to be more volatile than their mid and large peers. However, it\u2019s worth taking a look at some as valuations of many large-cap stocks are extremely high. Given their smaller size, these companies have more room for growth than large-cap stocks.
