The US economy contracted at an annual rate of 32.9% in the second quarter, confirming a recession. With losses piling up in an environment of very low business activity and widespread unemployment, the country slowly started reopening its economy with as many precautionary measures as possible. The CDC has affirmed a compulsory mask mandate and social distancing for most public spaces. Companies such as The Walt Disney Company (DIS) and Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) have reopened their business with proper precautions. This is allowing them to slowly recover from huge losses. On the other hand, companies such as Draftkings, Inc. (DKNG) and Penn National Gaming, Inc. (PENN) have focused on shifting their business online, thereby boosting their operations. Moreover, the return of live sports, increasing popularity of virtual sports betting and reopening of casinos should help these companies recover fast. 7 Best ETFs for the NEXT Bull MarketThe Walt Disney Company (DIS) As a diversified multinational entertainment company, DIS operates through four segments \u2014 Media Networks, Parks Experiences and Products, Studio Entertainment and Direct-to-Consumer and International. DIS has suffered tremendously since the onset of the pandemic, as most of its business remained closed for months. However, its recently launched online streaming service Disney + has gained significant traction during this time, as the social distancing norm has led many people to subscribe to online streaming services. Strictly from a price perspective, Disney+ premium charges are not sufficient to compensate for the pandemic driven losses. However, DIS is currently undertaking an aggressive pricing policy to expand its user base, and gradually emerge as a top streaming service provider internationally. Most of DIS theme parks and recreational resorts have reopened, and media houses have resumed production since July. This should support the company\u2019s financial growth to some extent in the upcoming quarter. Though DIS has a negative earnings outlook for the upcoming quarter, the company has beat EPS estimates in three out of trailing four quarters, which bodes well for the stock. Its revenue grew at a CAGR of 7.9% over the past three years, while total assets increased at a CAGR of 30.8%, over the same time period. DIS has gained more than 60% since hitting its 52- week low of $79.07 in March. How does DIS stack up for the POWR Ratings? B for Trade Grade A for Peer Grade B for Overall POWR Rating. The stock is also ranked #1 out of 14 stocks in the Entertainment \u2013 Sports & Theme Parks industry. Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) SBUX reported negative year-to-date gains, as the virus driven lockdown has reduced customer traffic in its retail coffee shops across the world. However, with the gradual recovery of the world economy, most Starbucks establishments are now open. The speedy recovery of China and reopening of the United States were key in SBUX\u2019s recovery, as most of its shops are concentrated in the United States and China. The company opened 130 new stores across the world, indicating a 5% year-over-year growth in net new stores in the third fiscal quarter. SBUX\u2019s EPS is expected to rise at 2.7% per annum over the next five years. Its total assets grew at a CAGR of 26.1% over the past three years, while revenue increased at a CAGR of 2.4% over the same period.
