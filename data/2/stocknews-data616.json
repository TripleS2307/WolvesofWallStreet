While many analysts estimated lower earnings figures for companies this quarter due to the pandemic, many companies have come through with strong earnings instead. An earnings surprise occurs when a company reports earnings or revenue above analyst\u2019s expectation. Analysts form their expectations based on current market conditions, previous reports, and company guidance. They typically speak with corporate management, visit a company\u2019s headquarters, and learn everything they can about the company and its industry. That information forms the basis of his or her judgment of the company. That information is incorporated into a mathematical financial model to determine revenue and earnings estimates. When a company reports earnings or revenue above that estimate, it can significantly affect the stock price. It can lead to an immediate price jump after the report and that positive price appreciation can continue over the intermediate-term. Three stocks reported earnings surprises last night, which led to substantial price performance today: Groupon (GRPN), Zillow Group (ZG), and Stamps.com (STMP). 7 Best ETFs for the NEXT Bull MarketGroupon (GRPN) GRPN acts as a middleman between consumers and merchants by offering a variety of products and services at steep discounts through its online store.
