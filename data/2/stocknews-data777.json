The company announced this week that it has expanded its portfolio by adding two cannabis facilities in New Jersey. The first facility is an industrial building roughly 50,000 square feet in size along with a retail location totaling roughly 4,000 square feet. The company paid approximately $12.4 million for both properties by closing a sale-leaseback agreement with a subsidiary of Columbia Care. The way this works is that IIPR acquired the cultivation facility site for cash and then immediately leased the property back to Columbia. IIPR has agreed to provide Columbia Care with up to $1.6 million in reimbursements for improvements to the property. The company plans to continue to operate the retail property as a regulated medical-use cannabis dispensary and the industrial property as a regulated medical-use cannabis cultivation and processing facility. 7 \"SAFE HAVEN\" Dividend Stocks for Turbulent TimesColumbia Care is a perfect tenant for IIPR as they focus heavily on the medical cannabis sector.
