The S&P 500 Growth ETF (SPYG) is up 43.4% since April, compared with the S&P 500 Value ETF\u2019s (SPYV) gain of 23.7%. Technology and healthcare stocks have primarily driven growth. Technology companies have paved the way for society\u2019s full embrace of the digital world, and healthcare companies have seen a demand for COVID-related therapies in addition to the long-term need for treatment and medicine to combat critical diseases. Growth stocks are companies that are expected to grow significantly above the average growth rate of the market. I like to look at both revenue and earnings growth to getter a better idea of a company\u2019s prospects. I consider a growth stock to be one that has a growth stock rate above 25% for earnings and revenue over different time frame of one to five years. I also like to consider technical aspects of stocks to make sure they are in a bullish trend. One technical indicator I like to consider is On Balance Volume (OBV). OBV uses volume flow to predict changes in stock price. It was developed by Joseph Granville who believed volume was the main force behind markets, and OBV would predict market moves based on volume changes. 9 \"BUY THE DIP\" Growth Stocks For 2020Another technical indicator I like to use is MACD, which is the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence. This indicator is a trend-following indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a stock\u2019s price. It is calculated by subtracting the 26 Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) from the 12 Day average. The signal line is a 9-day EMA of the differential line. A buy signal occurs when the MACD crosses above the signal line. Using my parameters, here are three growth stocks showing strong price action: Horizon Therapeutics (HZNP), Tesla (TSLA), and Syneos Health (SYNH). Horizon Therapeutics (HZNP) HZNP is a specialty and generic drug manufacturing company.
