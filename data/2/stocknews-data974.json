Businesses have taken a nosedive since the pandemic started, with people avoiding to eat at restaurants. Over 8 million restaurant employees have lost their jobs in the United States alone. The long lock down period dealt a massive blow to restaurants, as operators had to keep dine-in services closed. Although the hopes of restaurant operators have dimmed, there seems to be a light at the end of the tunnel. A few restaurants have adapted to the \u201cnew normal\u201d by focusing on takeout and delivery options. The National Restaurant Association asked for a $240 billion recovery fund from the Treasury Department. If granted, this would allow restaurant owners to survive the pandemic and eventually recover their businesses. 9 \"BUY THE DIP\" Growth Stocks For 2020Even if there is a second wave of the virus, these three stocks could keep moving higher with a robust infrastructural setup of delivery and takeout services.
