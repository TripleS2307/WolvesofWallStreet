Before this decline, the precious metal has impressively rallied. Gold has been the perfect asset for the weak economy, uncertain political and economic environment, and considerable amounts of stimulus as it benefits from rising inflation expectations and lower rates. In recent days, there\u2019s been increasing optimism that a credible vaccine will be available by year-end, and the economy is doing better than expectations. This has led to selling pressure in safe havens like gold. Still, gold has risen more than 28% so far this year. If the economy underperforms, and the government pushes out more stimulus, then prices will likely increase. A rise in gold prices directly benefits gold miners by helping them generate higher profits, especially as gold prices are above miners\u2019 costs currently. Many gold miners also pay dividends, which will reward investors if gold trades sideways for an extended period before making new highs. 7 \"SAFE HAVEN\" Dividend Stocks for Turbulent TimesThe temporary setback for the precious metal could be a good opportunity to enter gold mining stocks like Barrick Gold (GOLD), Franco-Nevada Corporation (FNV), Agnico Eagle (AEM), and Royal Gold (RGLD).
