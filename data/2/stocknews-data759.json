That\u2019s too bad, because they\u2019re one of the best ways to get a high, safe income stream. And you can supercharge their dividends by purchasing these \u201cdividend unicorns\u201d through preferred-stock closed-end funds. Before I go further, let me say that if the term \u201cpreferred shares\u201d has your eyes glazing over, I get it: most people feel these investments are too obscure to bother with. But stick with me, because preferreds are actually perfectly suited to today\u2019s contradictory economy, with its high numbers of bankruptcies and a rising stock market. Built for a Crisis 9 \"BUY THE DIP\" Growth Stocks For 2020Preferred stocks that are bought individually\u2014that is, outside of a fund\u2014yield 5.6% as I write this. But purchasing through a CEF can upsize that payout to 7%, 8%\u2014even 9%. CEFs do this in two ways, both of which are badly misunderstood by the mainstream crowd. The first happens when a CEF trades at a discount to net asset value (NAV). This is a unique feature of CEFs, and an indicator you can easily spot on any fund screener. It basically means that the fund\u2019s market price\u2014or what we pay when we buy the CEF on the market\u2014is lower than its NAV, or the per-share value of its portfolio. The upshot is that the yield as a percentage of NAV is lower than the yield on the discounted market price\u2014and therefore easier for management to cover through the returns (and dividends) they make in the market. The best way to think of it is like this: the bigger the discount, the safer the dividend. The other way CEFs get us this larger yield is by borrowing to invest. That sounds dangerous, but preferred-stock CEFs cut risk by limiting these borrowings to 35% of their portfolios or less, on average. Leverage risk is also mitigated by the fact that these funds have hundreds of holdings, and preferred stocks are less volatile than regular stocks. Limited Drawdowns From a Lower-Volatility Asset Class As you can see from this chart, with the exception of the COVID-19 crisis, preferred stocks decline less than the market (and even the COVID-19 returns are misleading, as I\u2019ll explain in a bit). This makes preferred-stock CEFs a great alternative when the market is overheated (like now) and a great asset to hold over the long haul because of their big dividend payouts. Another Preferred-Stock \u201cSafety Valve\u201d Another benefit of preferred stocks is that they\u2019re higher up the corporate capital structure than regular stocks. This means that in the event of bankruptcy, owners of preferreds are compensated sooner, while \u201ccommon\u201d shareholders get the scraps\u2014if they get anything at all. And as we already discussed, preferred stockholders get a higher dividend, much like creditors for debt and bonds. Preferred stocks\u2019 higher payouts also make them a great way to get income from a company that doesn\u2019t pay much in dividends. Take, for instance, Capital One Financial (COF), whose regular shares yield 2.5%. That\u2019s more than the S&P 500 average but less than Capital One Series I preferred shares, which yield 5.4%. So the preferred stock is more than doubling our yield here. That\u2019s not all it\u2019s doing. When we compare Capital One common shares (in orange below) with the preferred stock (in blue), we see that the preferred stock has performed much better during this crisis. Capital One Preferreds Outperform Their \u201cCommon\u201d Cousins This is no fluke: many preferred stocks fared much better in the selloff, with the exception of those in the energy sector. And since energy accounts for a big slice of the preferred-stock market, the performance of preferred funds as a whole looked worse than it actually was. Tactical preferred-stock investing actually saw a much smaller drawdown. I\u2019m sure you can see where I\u2019m headed here: in a world where we\u2019re facing bankruptcies from the likes of J.C. Penney, Hertz Global Holdings (HTZ) and Frontier Communications, a few carefully selected preferred-stock CEFs make a nice addition to any investor\u2019s portfolio. Let\u2019s dive into four bargains in the space now. 4 Cheap Preferred-Stock CEFs Yielding 7.1%+ The beauty of a preferred-stock CEF is that you get access to professional management. That\u2019s critical in the preferred market, which is tough for you and I to access and research on our own. And because they have a savvy human at the helm, all of these funds outperform their benchmark. That\u2019s no typo: of the 16 preferred-stock CEFs on the market, all have beaten the benchmark iShares Preferred & Income Securities ETF (PFF), which follows a passive index of the broader preferred-stock market. While that makes all preferred-stock CEFs worth a look, I want to highlight just four for you, for one reason. The market is well aware of preferred-stock CEFs and their big dividends, so most trade at a premium\u2014with the exception of these four, which slipped through the cracks. Symbol Name Premium/Discount Dividend Yield Long-Term Annualized Returns FPF First Trust Intermediate Duration Preferred & Income -2.7% 7.5% 5.7% JPC Nuveen Preferred Income Opportunities Fund -4.1% 7.6% 9.6% JPS Nuveen Preferred Securities income Fund -2.6% 6.9% 9.0% LDP Cohen & Steers Limited Duration Preferred and Income Fund -4.3% 7.6% 6.6% In addition to yields of 6.9% and up, these funds have diversified portfolios of preferred stocks in several sectors (including finance, telecommunications and technology) while also trading for less than their portfolios are worth. That makes them compelling income options for today\u2019s unpredictable market. Want More Great Investing Ideas?
