SBUX has rapidly grown into the world\u2019s dominant coffee shop-themed chain over five decades in 83 markets. It operates through three main business segments and breaks them down into \u2013 Americas, International, and Channel Development. SBUX, like many restaurants and retailers, has been severely affected by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic this year. The company announced its plan to close up to 400 stores in the United States in its fiscal third quarter ended June 28, 2020. Net revenue for the quarter was $4.2 billion, down 38.1% from the year-ago quarter. The coffee chain posted a net loss of $678.1 million for the quarter, implying a significant decline from the $1.4 billion gain posted in the same three-month period last year. However, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 10% year-over-year to $0.45 per share for its fourth quarter. International store count, during the last reported quarter, increased 9% year-over-year. SBUX\u2019s expansion in China is getting a promising twist. The company has 10 Starbucks Now locations in China, designed exclusively for mobile ordering, takeout, and delivery. Expanding a partnership signed with conglomerate Alibaba (BABA) in 2018, customers can now order drinks on the Taobao marketplace and mobile map app, Amap. Moreover, to accelerate the adoption of the Now model, the company has also extended Now to four of BABA\u2019s platforms. Stores in the United States and China now comprise 61% of the company\u2019s global portfolio, with 15,243 and 4,447 stores, respectively. 9 \"BUY THE DIP\" Growth Stocks For 2020\u201cStarbucks is taking longer to recover than our other restaurant companies given that the brand generates 50% of sales from breakfast, a daypart which is geared towards work and school commuting routines,\u201d Bill Ackman stated in Pershing Square\u2019s semi-annual report in August. SBUX\u2019s recovery looks durable. Also, the potential upside based on several factors has helped it earn a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating in our proprietary rating system. Here is how our proprietary POWR Ratings system evaluates SBUX: Trade Grade: A SBUX is currently trading higher than its 50-day and 200-day moving averages of $81.98 and $79.11, respectively, indicating that the stock is in an uptrend. The stock\u2019s 20% return over the past three months reflects a short-term bullishness. SBUX opened 130 net new stores in its fiscal third quarter, yielding 5% year-over-year unit growth. The company ended the period with 32,180 stores globally, of which 51% and 49% were company-operated and licensed, respectively. The company plans to open approximately 300 net new stores in America and at least 500 net new stores in China by the end of this fiscal year. Buy & Hold Grade: A SBUX is well positioned in terms of proximity to its 52-week high, which is a key factor that our Buy & Hold Grade takes into account. The stock is currently trading just 6% below its 52-week high of $94.13. The stock has gained more than 70% in the last three years due to its steady growth in customers, stable cash flows, and increasing dividends. It has an impressive long-term performance, as its revenues grew at a CAGR of 5.5% over the past five years. The company has a history of making strategic pivots to keep up with shifting tastes. One of those is the company\u2019s recent partnership with Impossible Brands to introduce plant-based breakfast sandwiches. This is consistent with the company\u2019s stated sustainability goals as well as the value of many of its consumers. Peer Grade: A SBUX is currently rated #2 out of 49 stocks in the Restaurant industry. Other popular stocks in the industry are McDonald\u2019s Corporation (MCD), Dunkin\u2019 Brands Group, Inc.

MCD, DNKN, and SHAK have returned 16.6%, 9.7%, and 10.1%, respectively, over this period. Industry Rank: A The Restaurant industry is ranked #22 out of the 123 StockNews.com industries. The companies in this industry own and operate restaurants and other eating places, including full-service restaurants, quick-service restaurants, and buffets.

Guest temperature checks, online ordering and takeout, and contactless service are among the safety precautions restaurants are implementing. Overall POWR Rating: A (Strong Buy) Overall, SBUX is rated a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d due to its impressive performance, steady growth in stores, and short-and-long-term developments, as determined by the four components of our overall POWR Rating.
