Last year, it earned $31 billion in profits, and it\u2019s used these proceeds to build businesses in adjacent areas and invest in other promising companies. Google\u2019s Search business also gives it unusual insight into the world and human behavior. Search volume around a subject can be a leading indicator of trends.

Opportunities in Healthcare Before examining these individual companies, it\u2019s interesting to consider why Google\u2019s venture investments have been so heavily geared towards healthcare given that Google is a tech company. According to Google, 7% of searches are related to healthcare which means that every minute, there are 70,000 healthcare-related inquiries on its platform. So far, Google has invested in 57 healthcare companies, and they account for a third of its venture portfolio. Google\u2019s interest also makes sense in terms of demographics as the US population is getting older and living longer. This means the demand for healthcare will continue rising at a faster rate than overall economic growth. For Google, there are also synergies with its Search and Cloud businesses.

A part of the solution is telehealth which can help doctors see more patients. It\u2019s also a more convenient option for patients, saving them time, especially when it comes to less serious issues. Telehealth platforms also lead to more frequent contact between doctors and patients which also correlates to better health outcomes. AMWL is the second-leading telehealth company in the US.

Average daily visits in AMWL\u2019s last quarter were 45,000 versus 2,000 per day in 2019. Further, telehealth has been very successful with 76% of patients reporting that they will keep using it even after the pandemic. It also is following the same pattern as other growth industries like fintech and eCommerce which were growing fast before the pandemic but experienced a massive acceleration due to the conditions. In its last quarter, AMWL\u2019s revenue grew 94% compared to the previous year. Google has invested $100 million into the company, and it retains a 3% stake. As part of the investment, AMWL is using Google Cloud. Clover Health (IPOC) Clover Health is a health insurance startup.

Gene-editing stocks have been strong performers over the last couple of years as they have significant potential in screening early drug candidates. There is also a lot of excitement about future applications, like removing cells, changing them at a chromosomal level, and then reinjecting them into patients. Even further down the road, scientists believe that they will be able to edit cells without having to remove them. This could have major implications in terms of treating all types of diseases by targeting them at the cellular level. It also could result in lengthening lifespans and improving the quality of life by repairing damaged cells. Google originally invested in the company in 2015 along with other luminaries like Bill Gates, Khosla Ventures, and Cowen Private Investments which valued the company at $100 million. Currently, EDIT has a valuation of $2 billion. EDIT\u2019s core product is its gene-editing platform that can be used for multiple diseases.

Customers can text their doctors at any time, schedule same-day appointments, and get access to a digital platform with patients\u2019 complete health records. 1Life believes that improving primary care and fostering more communication between patients and doctors will lead to better outcomes. It also believes that people are willing to pay for convenience. The platform also appeals to physicians who are often inundated with paperwork and dealing with insurance rather than tending to patients. 1Life offers the opportunity for doctors to focus on their patients rather than other responsibilities.

Net revenue increased to $78 million which is an 18% increase. It\u2019s also expanding into new markets and adding new partners. Currently, 1Life is focused on adding patients and doctors to its platform, but it believes that it will be able to offer higher-value-added services in the future like constant-monitoring devices, smart scales, and other resources that will lead to doctors being able to monitor patients\u2019 health more vigorously. Currently, it estimates it\u2019s a market opportunity to be $34 billion to offer \u201cconcierge-level healthcare\u201d but expects this to expand to $81 billion over the next five years.
