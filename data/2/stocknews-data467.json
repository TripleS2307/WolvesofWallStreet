There is plenty of pent up demand for homes. The only question is how long this epic home sales run will continue. Even if the housing market cools down in the months ahead, furniture stocks will benefit as new homeowners buy couches, chairs, tables, nightstands, and more to fill their new digs. This means furniture stocks should be stable investments through the next year.
