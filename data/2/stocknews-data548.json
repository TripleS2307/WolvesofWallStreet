With close to 80% of the US workforce employed by this sector, it adopted the policy to have the majority of employees work remotely by setting up a virtual office space. This led to an increase in demand for hardware products. The increased in-house recreational needs with people unable to do outdoor recreational activities, and remote education needs with schools being closed, also added to the demand for computer and related hardware products. In this context, earlier this year, Microsoft Corporation\u2019s (MSFT) Chief Product officer said, \u201cCustomers are using Windows PCs to stay productive, connect and learn in this time. In fact, over 4 trillion minutes are being spent on Windows 10 a month, a 75% increase year on year.\u201d He also mentioned that more than 1 billion devices are currently run on Windows 10. 7 \"SAFE HAVEN\" Dividend Stocks for Turbulent TimesMoreover, the IT industry is actively designing hardware products to suit the upcoming 5G technology. Companies such as Dell Technologies, Inc. (DELL), Synopsys, Inc. (SNPS) and Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (CDNS\u00ad) have huge growth potential, given highly anticipated technological advancements coupled with a rising demand for computers among the masses. With the 5G race becoming more intense with each passing day and the \u201cwork from home\u201d culture expected to continue for some time in the absence of any approved vaccine so far, these companies are expected to gain tremendously through the remainder of 2020. Dell Technologies, Inc. (DELL) As one of the most popular names in the IT industry, DELL has a global presence for designing, developing, and manufacturing both hardware and software components of computers and laptops. With work from home being the \u201cnew normal,\u201d the demand for DELL\u2019s products has significantly increased over the past few months. DELL announced first quarter fiscal 2021 (ending May) deferred revenue of $27.6 billion, which increased 14% year-over-year. DELL currently holds 81% of VMware, which is valued at more than the parent company itself. DELL has recently announced that it is planning a spin-off of the VMware stake, which could increase the valuation of DELL by billions. This deal is expected to mutually benefit both companies, with DELL achieving investment grade credit. Scheduled for September 2021, this deal is timed to limit the federal income taxation applicable, allowing DELL to retain its earnings. DELL\u2019s shares have gained over 7% in value in the first week of July, as investors were optimistic about this spin-off. The stock gained more than 140% from the 52-week low of $25.51 it hit in March. DELL\u2019s strong recovery could be part of a growth momentum and sound business plan that could continue through the remainder of 2020. CEO Michael Dell said, \u201cWe are focused on winning in the consolidating markets where we operate and innovating across the Dell portfolio to create integrated solutions that turn data into insights and action.\u201d The consensus EPS estimate for the second quarter ending July 2020 of $1.38 indicates a year-over-year decline. However, DELL has surpassed EPS estimates in three out of the last four quarters, which is impressive. How does DELL stack up for the POWR Ratings?

CDNS\u2019 other services include digital integrated circuit designs and signoff, custom IC design and verification, system interconnect and analysis and intellectual property. CDNS has huge growth potential, as the demand for hardware upgrades of existing technology is increasing. As 5G is the most anticipated technology development this year, the demand for CDNS\u2019 hardware services can skyrocket in the upcoming months. As a part of the expansion plan, CDNS has collaborated with several companies operating in the same industry to create a brand value of its services in the market, as well as establish itself as a key player. CDNS\u2019 Cadence millimeter wave (mmWave) got certified for United Microelectronics Corporation\u2019s (UMC) 28HPC+ process technology on July 23rd. This will allow CDNS to gain access to integrated RF design flow which accelerates time to market.

SNPS is a prime contractor for Automatic Implementation of Secure Silicon (AISS) program developed by the Defense Advanced research Projects agency. On July 14th, SNPS launched JEDEC DDR5 compliant verification IP for double data rate 5 (DDR5) DRAM/DRIM. This technology provides higher performance for lower power on enterprise applications, cloud-based services, hyperscale data centers and high-performance workstations/ servers. As the demand for powerful chip processors and software upgrades are rising to facilitate the \u201cwork from home\u201d culture, SNPS\u2019 partnerships have led to profitable results for the second quarter of 2020. SNPS\u2019 non-GAAP revenue grew 5.7% year-over-year in the quarter to $188.30 million.
