This makes sense, as a huge investment has been made for the development of a vaccine or treatment by both government and private organizations. In addition, the search for COVID treatments has put renewed focus on the demand for new drugs for other conditions. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB), which can be used as an indicator of the performance of biotech stocks, gained more than 36% since hitting its low in mid-March. This compares to the S&P 500\u2019s 27.1% return over the same period. Performance for the sector should continue into next year whether the pandemic is over or not.

In September 2020, the company had entered into a global antibody manufacturing collaboration with Eli Lilly and Company (LLY) to significantly increase the supply capacity available for Lilly\u2019s potential COVID-19 therapies.
