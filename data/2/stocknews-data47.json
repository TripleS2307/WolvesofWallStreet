However, if many traders all short the same stock and the trade turns against them, they can get caught in a money-losing short squeeze. For high-yield stocks, selling short is often a bet on a dividend cut. When that doesn\u2019t happen, the shorts can, well, take it in the shorts.

One is what happened with Bed Bath & Beyond: a positive earnings report when traders were expecting the opposite. A dividend announcement or ex-dividend date may also trigger buying by short-sellers.

The Iron Mountain business should be recession-resistant, destroying short-sellers\u2019 hopes. IRM currently yields 9.2%. ViacomCBS Inc. (VIAC) ViacomCBS Inc. (VIAC) short interest totals 19% of the total share float. It seems that short sellers are betting that COVID-19 infections could shut down NFL games, hurting a significant revenue source for CBS.

The New York Times Company (NYT) The New York Times Company (NYT) is a top-10 shorted stock with 15.5% of the float reported sold short. The short thesis is that declining advertising revenue will hurt profits. The short danger is that a good earnings report could trigger a short squeeze. This stock may be a case where the shorts are right, but the short interest is too high, making the trade more dangerous. The next earnings release will be in early November. The New York Times Company pays a small quarterly dividend and yields 0.55%. Want More Great Investing Ideas? Top Dividend Stock to Own!
