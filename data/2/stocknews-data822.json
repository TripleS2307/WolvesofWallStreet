Consulting firm Omdia Tractica expects revenues for 2025 to reach $126 billion. Millions of consumers already interact with AI on a day-to-day basis. AI powers Alexa and Siri, facial-recognition technology, chatbots, and gaming platforms. The technology should continue to improve through learning and solving problems. For instance, car companies investing heavily in self-driving technology. We are only beginning to test AIs capabilities. Here are four artificial intelligence stocks to take advantage of this exploding growth industry. Apple, Inc (AAPL) 9 \"BUY THE DIP\" Growth Stocks For 2020According to CB Insights, AAPL has been acquiring several promising AI startups.

In the recent WorldWide Developers Conference, AAPL announced several features for its macOS, iPad, and iOS products that are powered by AI technology such as facial recognition, sleep tracking, handwashing countdown, and so on.

NVDA recently entered into a partnership with Google Cloud to power its cloud infrastructure for improving artificial intelligence workloads. This new chipset, called the A100, is powerful enough to power AI to tell the difference between scientific computing, 5 services, and more.
