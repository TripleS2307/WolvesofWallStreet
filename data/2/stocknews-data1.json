Both stocks have generated significant returns year-to-date, despite the coronavirus pandemic. NIO is the clear winner with 426.9% returns year-to-date versus TSLA\u2019s 396.1%. But which of these stocks is a better pick now? Let\u2019s find out.

With a huge population and thereby potential market, this expansion is expected to ramp up profits for the company.

It also plans to buy back some of its shares from Hefei investor group, which previously bailed out the company with a $1.40 billion cash infusion.

It is planning to launch its EVs in the European market by 2021. Recent Financial Results TSLA\u2019s EV deliveries increased 7% year-over-year in the third quarter. In the second quarter, TSLA reported net revenue of $6.04 billion, indicating a year-over-year decline. However, net revenues grew 1% on a sequential basis. Net income of $104 million and EPS of $0.50 for the quarter indicates a significant improvement from the year-ago negative values. Cash and cash equivalents improved 74% year-over-year to $8.62 billion. NIO\u2019s vehicle sales and total revenues both increased 146.5% year-over-year to $493.40 million and $526.40 million respectively in the second quarter ended June 2020. Gross profit of $44.30 million compares to a loss reported in the prior-year quarter.

In September alone, NIO delivered 4,708 vehicles, indicating a 133.2% rise from the year-ago value. Thus, NIO has an edge over TSLA here.

NIO\u2019s revenue is expected to increase 137.7% in the current quarter, 95.7% in the current year and 75.5% next year. Hence, NIO is in an advantageous position here. Valuation NIO is currently trading at 15.88x its trailing-twelve-month sales versus TELA\u2019s 14.65x.
