For instance, factors can include growth, value, fundamental strength, efficiency, and momentum. Typically, investors only consider one or two factors when looking at a stock. A growth stock trading at a discount might be an interesting play. But what if you could find stocks that tick every box? A stock that has strong value and growth attributes has fundamental strength, efficiency, and is also trading upwards. These stocks are the cream of the crop based on multi-factor strength. To find these types of stocks, I ran a proprietary screen with multiple metrics over the various factors. This resulted in a shortlist of stocks. I then narrowed down that list with stocks rated a Strong Buy by our exclusive POWR Ratings system. 7 Best ETFs for the NEXT Bull MarketHere are four stocks that show strength in growth, value, fundamentals, efficiency, and momentum: Best Buy Co (BBY), Deckers Outdoor (DECK), Emergent Biosolutions (EBS), and Murphy USA (MUSA).
