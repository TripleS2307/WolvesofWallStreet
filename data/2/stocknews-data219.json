Though the tech industry has thrived since then, other sectors were severely affected. However, as the economy is demonstrating signs of recovery in the second half of 2020, the tech industry experienced a massive sell-off, sparking fears of a market correction. With the recovering economy increasing employment and disposable income, several stocks are gaining traction. As a result, most economists and analysts are expecting a sector rotation, wherein consumer discretionary and financial services could primarily take the lead. A recovering economy is likely to see a surge in borrowing levels, given the Fed\u2019s recent decision to keep interest rates low for years. An increase in sales of consumer discretionary products and higher financial transactions are expected. Also, most of the mega-cap stocks have become relatively expensive now, so focus could shift toward small-cap stocks that still have room for growth. ETFs such as the SPDR Select Sector Consumer Discretionary ETF (XLY), the iShares U.S. Financial Services ETF (IYG), and the Vanguard Small-Cap Value ETF (VBR) are likely to gain substantially in the upcoming months given their exposure to industries and stocks that are expected to thrive going forward. 9 \"BUY THE DIP\" Growth Stocks For 2020Consumer Discretionary Select SPDR ETF (XLY) XLY primarily invests in large cap consumer discretionary stocks. As the economy recovers from the pandemic-induced recession, consumer discretionary stocks stand to see revenue and earnings growth, with people spending more on goods they want. XLY\u2019s top holdings include Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), Home Depot, Inc. (HD), and McDonald\u2019s Corp (MCD), which make up 42.2% of the ETF\u2019s assets. With $15.7 billion in assets, XLY closely tracks the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector Index. Its expense ratio of 0.13% is significantly lower than the category average of 0.46%.

XLY has gained more than 85% since hitting its 52-week low of $81.74 in March. The ETF hit its 52-week high of $154.14 in September. How does XLY stack up for the POWR Ratings? A for Trade Grade A for Buy & Hold Grade A for Industry Rank A for Overall POWR Rating. You can\u2019t ask for better.

IYG primarily focuses on the biggest players in this sector. Visa, Inc. (V), J.P. Morgan & Chase, Co. (JPM), and Mastercard, Inc. (MA) make up 34.6% of this ETF\u2019s portfolio.
