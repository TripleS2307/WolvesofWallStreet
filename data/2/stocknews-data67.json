The college football playoff, which is one of the biggest programs conducted by most colleges across the country, is expected to begin in the fall with proper precautions. The director of sports business program Patrick Rishe values the college football industry at $4 billion (in terms of revenue) in 2020. The return of the college sports industry after a six-month hiatus due to the COVID-19 crisis bodes well for several fitness and virtual sports betting stocks as well. With physical gathering estimated to be limited this time, online sports betting and viewership is expected to skyrocket this fall. Companies such as Nike, Inc. (NKE), Draftkings, Inc. (DKNG), and Penn National Gaming, Inc. (PENN) are expected to see a surge in demand for their products and services ahead of the sports kick-off, resulting in higher revenue and earnings.
