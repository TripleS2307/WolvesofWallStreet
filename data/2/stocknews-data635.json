That is because analysts keep a close eye on every development a company makes. To trigger a Buy, Strong Buy, Hold, Sell, or Strong Sell, something has usually changed for a company. It could be a surprise earnings beat or miss, a new executive being hired or fired, a shift the economy, a delay in the release of a product or service, etc. When a stock is rated a Buy, it often moves higher, and when it is rated a Sell, it often moves lower. Which is why during this uncertain economic environment, it could be a good idea to stay away from stocks with Sell ratings and focus on stocks with Buy ratings. 7 \"SAFE HAVEN\" Dividend Stocks for Turbulent TimesTake a look at Arthur J.
