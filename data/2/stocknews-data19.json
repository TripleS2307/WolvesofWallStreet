After the record-setting rally of the stock market after the March bottom, September witnessed a tech-led sell-off with investors\u2019 concerned over stalled fiscal stimulus talks, the upcoming election, and rising coronavirus case counts. With concerns over these issues still remaining in place, the market is expected to remain extremely volatile this month.
