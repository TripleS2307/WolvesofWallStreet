Discount store merchandise was once stereotyped as inferior in quality, likely to break soon after purchase, and unworthy of consumers\u2019 hard-earned dollars. Furthermore, plenty of shoppers frowned at the idea of spending a little extra time waiting in line to check out their items at discount stores with comparably fewer cashiers. Times have now changed. The once-neglected discount stores are now the apple of investors\u2019 eyes. Though discount store checkout lines are slower than those at regular stores, people have more time on their hands now than in years past due to widespread unemployment and underemployment. Most important is the fact that consumers are looking to reduce spending in every way possible.
