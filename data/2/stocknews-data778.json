Auto part stocks do well during periods of higher demand for cars and trucks. And, there was optimism for an uptick in vehicle sales following three years of declining sales. First of all, the average age of the car on the road was hitting a record-high of 11.8 years which indicates pent-up demand for new cars to replace older vehicles. The labor market was in good shape, wages were trending higher, and low rates made cars quite affordable due to available and abundant auto financing terms. 7 Best ETFs for the NEXT Bull MarketAnother positive factor for the auto parts stocks was clarity on trade with the signing of the Phase 1 deal between the US and China. However, the coronavirus has wrecked this bullish thesis. Car sales have plunged. Supply lines have been disrupted due to the coronavirus which has led to shutdowns at many manufacturing facilities. For auto parts, this is complicated as it negatively affects them from a production and demand perspective. However, once this crisis passes, the same positive fundamentals will remain. Further, there is talk of a new \u201ccash for clunkers\u201d bill which could lead to a surge of car buying. Additionally, rates are even lower. Certain auto parts stocks will grow stronger during this crisis, while weaker ones will lose market share. Here are three auto part stocks worth considering: VOXX International Corporation (VOXX) VOXX is a global manufacturer and distributor of automotive and consumer technologies. Earlier this month, VOXX acquired Directed\u2019s aftermarket remote start, security systems, and connected car solutions for $11 million.

EyeLock, a majority-owned subsidiary of VOXX that provides iris-based identity authentication solutions, recently announced a partnership with Marubeni America Corporation and Marubeni Metals Corporation. This partnership will give EyeLock access to the Japanese market and also the opportunity to expand in Asia. With an increased demand for \u201cself-owned vehicles\u201d as people try to avoid public transport, the demand for auto parts will be on the rise. VOXX has been performing well during these turbulent times and has added approximately 268% to its stock price since this year\u2019s low of $1.82 hit on March 20th due to the virus-led market crash.
