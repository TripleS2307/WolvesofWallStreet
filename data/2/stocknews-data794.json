However, this isn\u2019t true for all companies. Earnings season is upon us and we\u2019ve seen some companies report and actually raise their guidance for the upcoming quarter and/or the full year. Guidance is important because stock prices often rise on increased guidance, as it means that the company has higher expectations in their earnings and/or sales, which in turn can catapult their stock price higher. 9 \"BUY THE DIP\" Growth Stocks For 2020Here are four stocks that recently reported earnings and raised their guidance: Micron (MU) MU had a particularly strong earnings report on July 18th. The company shipped more chips than expected, and the price per chip was higher than expected. MU also said that orders for the next quarter were \u201cvery strong\u201d. As a result, MU increased its earnings forecast for the fourth quarter by 20%, and revenue by 10%. This was a sharp contrast from analysts who were expecting a decline in earnings due to lower demand. The POWR Ratings is constructive on MU as well as it\u2019s rated a Buy. It has an \u201cA\u201d for Trade Grade and Industry Rank. It\u2019s ranked #31 out of 86 stocks in the Semiconductor & Wireless Chips group. Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) TSM is the world\u2019s largest chip foundry. The company reported earnings on July 16th and beat consensus expectations in the current quarter and guided higher for the next quarter. It\u2019s clear from MU and TSM that demand for computer chips is strong as the coronavirus and \u201cwork from home\u201d has led to many companies making hefty investments in their cloud infrastructure. Another factor is the worldwide spending on upgrading mobile networks to the 5G standard. For its next quarter, TSM forecast revenue between $11.2 billion and $11.5 billion which was above expectations of $10.7 billion. TSM\u2019s stock has been a winner with a 15% gain so far this month, as it\u2019s carving out fresh, all-time highs. It\u2019s also up 50% from its March-lows and 12% higher than its pre-coronavirus peak. The POWR Ratings are also consistent with this strong outlook, as it has a Strong Buy Rating. It has an \u201cA\u201d in all categories including Trade Grade, Buy & Hold Grade, Peer Grade, and Industry Rank. Among semiconductor stocks, it\u2019s ranked #1 out of 86. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) On July 16th, JNJ released earnings in which they beat sales and earnings forecast, and it upgraded its outlook for the remainder of the year. Despite the coronavirus leading to a reduction in many people getting medical care, JNJ\u2019s medical devices and pharmaceuticals business continued to grow. For the next quarter, JNJ raised its earnings forecast to $7.75 to $7.95 per share which was above its previous guidance and analysts\u2019 expectations.

Conagra (CAG) Another sector that has benefited from the coronavirus is food stocks which are seeing increased demand and more pricing power as more people are preparing food at home. CAG is 90% higher from its March lows and is now just 10% off it\u2019s all-time highs set in 2017.
