As a result, companies that outsource the installation, configuration, and management of these systems have been reporting strong earnings. The rise in remote work has increased the dependence on edge computing, creating an opportunity for IT outsourcing stocks. Many of these stocks also pay healthy dividends which adds to their attractiveness. 7 Best ETFs for the NEXT Bull MarketHere are the three outsourcing stocks that stand out for their exceptional fundamentals and dividends: Accenture plc (ACN), Infosys Limited (INFY), and Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (CTSH).
