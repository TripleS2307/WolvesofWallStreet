The virus sparked an economic downturn and created health crises in many countries. Now companies are in a race to find a vaccine. There are currently 135 vaccines in preclinical trials and twenty that are being tested on humans. Each company is trying to speed up the clinical trial process to be the first with a vaccine. The company with the first successful vaccine will reap the rewards of profit and worldwide recognition.
