As of 2018, the chemical industry constituted almost 15% of the US manufacturing sector. Chemical companies play an essential part in our everyday life. They are essential in the preservation and flavoring of food, they\u2019re used to make plastic, fertilizers and pesticides, and found in soaps and deodorants. However, the industry has not been performing well this year due to a downward trend in demand in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak and a short supply of raw materials. The Dow Jones Chemicals Titans 30 Index is down 4% for the year. 9 \"BUY THE DIP\" Growth Stocks For 2020But four chemical stocks have bucked this trend. Air Products and Chemicals (APD), Albemarle Corporation (ALB), The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (SMG), and FutureFuel (FF) have all outpaced their industry peers. Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (APD) APD focuses on manufacturing and marketing industrial gases. Apart from industrial gases, the company provides related equipment. APD has recently entered into a deal with ACWA Power worth $5 billion to manufacture green ammonia. This move will likely solidify APD\u2019s position as a leader in the industrial gas space. The company also recently acquired five plants for producing hydrogen. This expansion is expected to drive further growth for the company through the remainder of 2020 and beyond. The stock has returned more than 20% year to date, compared to the benchmark Dow Jones U.S. Chemicals Index\u2019s loss of 4.27% for the same period.
