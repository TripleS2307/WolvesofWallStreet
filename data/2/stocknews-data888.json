As for the economy, recent unemployment figures were not as bad as anticipated, but the virus could hang over our heads until 2022. The reduction in economic activity combined with a lack of a comprehensive plan to mitigate the virus\u2019s spread, has hurt several stock sectors, including restaurants and hospitality. Our exclusive POWR Ratings system recently downgraded Shake Shack (SHAK), Playa Hotels & Resorts N.V. (PLYA), and Preferred Apartment Communities (APTS) to Strong Sell ratings. Shake Shack (SHAK) 7 Best ETFs for the NEXT Bull MarketAlmost everyone who eats at SHAK agrees that the food tastes great. However, most SHAK restaurants have either temporarily closed or suffered a significant slowdown in business due to the coronavirus\u2019s spread. The massive decline in foot traffic has resulted in SHAK getting downgraded to a Strong Sell \u201cF\u201d rating. SHAK\u2019s stock performance is not pretty. The stock is down 18% over the past month and is down 18% year-to-date price. Out of 14 Wall Street analysts, 12 recommend holding SHAK. Beware of investing in this stock unless the economy reopens, and the virus dissipates within the next month or two. Playa Hotels & Resorts N.V. (PLYA) This is a terrible time to have money tied up in the resort/hospitality industry. The majority of stocks in this hard-hit space will likely be downgraded to a Sell or Strong Sell rating, which is the case for PLYA. The company develops, owns, and operates resorts in the Caribbean and in Mexico which is a problem since very few people are traveling because of the virus. PLYA has an F Trade Grade and an F Buy & Hold Grade. The stock is down 55% over the past year and is currently down 58% year-to-date. Though PLYA has slightly recovered from its April low, be cautious as we are still in uncharted waters. Preferred Apartment Communities (APTS) In normal circumstances, real estate investment trusts (REITs) are safe investments. However, we are living in anything but normal times. APTS\u2019s business model is dependent on renters and homeowners paying their rent and mortgages, but a third of all Americans could not make last month\u2019s payments. This is due to high unemployment and a lack of savings. APTS is rated a Strong Sell in our POWR Ratings system. In addition, the stock is ranked 18th of 20 stocks in the REITs \u2013 Residential industry. Although APTS had performed well between \u201915 and \u201917, the stock has been in the red over the past three years. APTS has a three-year return of -43%. While the company has a low forward P/E ratio of 6.87, now may not be the best time to invest.
