As it does, a trend line and a support level have formed, which can be helpful to investors looking to trade this stock. A trend line is a straight line connecting at least two price points and then extends into the future to act as a line of support or resistance. It\u2019s my opinion that any 2 points can start a trend line but when the stock tests the trend line 3 times or more, it becomes more relevant. In this case, GS has tested it\u2019s trend line (blue) 5 times in the past 3.5 months. 7 Best ETFs for the NEXT Bull MarketAlso in the chart below, you\u2019ll see that I have identified a support level (green) at $195. Notice that right now the trend line and the support level are intersecting at $195. Take a look at the 1-year chart of GS below with added notations: Chart of GS provided by TradingView If GS falls under $195, a trader could enter a short position with the expectation that there will be a breakdown lower in the stock price because the trendline and support level would be breached. Why could this stock move lower? Because banks have been hit hard COVID-19. GS is currently trading about 20% off it\u2019s 52-week high, as the S&P 500 is only down about 7%. Keep an eye on GS and be mindful of their next earnings report which will be released on August 10th. Have a good trading day!
