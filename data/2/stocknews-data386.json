Tesla\u2019s CEO Elon Musk elevation to become the world\u2019s third-richest may garner attention. The first trading day after the split could trigger a drop, followed by a bounce. There can be too much of a good thing \u2013 Tesla (TSLA) has dipped under $500 per share after it announced a sale of around $5 billion worth of stocks. The electric vehicle maker wants to raise some capital, after shares have rallied 70% since August 11. Goldman Sachs, Citibank, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, and other top banks have been hired to get the new shares into investors\u2019 hands. Pouring more equity onto the markets has disrupted the demand-supply equilibrium and pushed Tesla\u2019s stocks off the highs. Is the $5 billion sale the pinprick bursting the bubble? Skeptics examine the EV maker\u2019s meager sales \u2013 especially in comparison to legacy automobile companies \u2013 and financial struggles and would agree that shares are due for a retracement. 7 \"SAFE HAVEN\" Dividend Stocks for Turbulent TimesHowever, markets can stay irrationally exuberant for an extended time. Tesla has competitors \u2013 Workhorse being one of the more promising ones \u2013 but it enjoys the allure of founder Elon Musk. The celebrity billionaire is now the world\u2019s third-richest person, leaving Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg behind. Musk \u2013 who has 38 million+ Twitter followers \u2013 is also running SpaceX which just concluded another successful satellite launch en route to his aspiration to go to Mars. Some see the rush into Tesla\u2019s shares as a religion \u2013 with believers disinterested in financial figures.

That FOMO can still earn traders a handsome profit. TSLA Stock Price One of the more logical reasons for piling into TSLA was its announcement on August 11 that it would perform a 5- for-1 split in shares, making them more accessible to the retail crowd. That common financial exercise has now happened. On one hand, the news of the sale share and a \u201cbuy the rumor and sell the news\u201d response to the split may turn into a perfect storm to push prices lower. On the other hand, the current share price of around $480 and not above $2,000 indeed serves to attract smaller investors and gradually push the price higher. Overall, one could expect a short-term decline in the stock followed by a resumption of gains for TSLA. TSLA shares were trading at $479.57 per share on Tuesday afternoon, down $18.75 (-3.76%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 473.20%, versus a 10.32% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period."}]}
