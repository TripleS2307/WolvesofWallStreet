For those short on time, here is the nutshell version of these commentaries. The market looks set to correct 10-20% for the following reasons: Stocks are overbought after gaining an astonishing 60% in just 5 months. Valuation is getting very stretched at a PE of nearly 30. Remember that the historical norm is more like a PE of 15-16. And at the end of a bull run you may see the PE peak over 20\u2026but 30 seems far too rich at this juncture of the recovery.
