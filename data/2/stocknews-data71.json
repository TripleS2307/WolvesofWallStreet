TWLO\u2019s ability to drive growth and generate incremental revenue depends, in part, on the company\u2019s ability to maintain and grow its relationships with existing active customer accounts. The dollar-based net expansion rate for active customer accounts came in at 132% for the last reported quarter. Moreover, Twilio SendGrid, an email application programming interface (API), crossed a new milestone in the last quarter, surpassing three trillion processed emails since inception.

ESTC, DT, and EVBG have returned 73.9%, 63.6%, and 64.1%, respectively, over this period. Industry Rank: C The Software \u2013 SAAS industry is ranked #59 out of the 123 StockNews.com industries.

And since the onset of the health crisis, the remote working culture has amplified the dependence on digital infrastructure to overcome operational challenges. Overall POWR Rating: B (Buy) Overall, TWLO is rated a \u201cBuy\u201d due to its impressive quarterly performance, steadily growing customer base, and solid price momentum, as determined by the four components of our overall POWR Rating. Bottom Line TWLO has gained significantly so far this year and is a decent investment for investors looking for stability and growth in the long run. The stock was hit hard in the preceding month\u2019s massive sell-off but has recovered well. TWLO\u2019s valuation looks frothy as it is burning cash, and is not profitable yet. However, we expect a permanent shift toward hybrid work environments in 2021, which will increase the ubiquity of digital communications platforms and the need for such APIs. Hence, we can expect a healthy increase in demand for TWLO\u2019s services in the coming quarters. Analyst sentiment, which gives a good sense of a stock\u2019s future price movement, is pretty impressive for TWLO. The average broker rating of 1.27 indicates a favorable analyst sentiment. Of the 28 Wall Street Analysts that rated the stock, 21 have given it a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating. Consensus revenue estimate for the upcoming year indicates a 25% year-over-year growth.
