This phenomenon has attracted the attention of many analysts and economists that have narrowed it down to two reasons. First is the historically low Fed interest rates, which have reduced the mortgage rates significantly, making it relatively cheaper to buy a house. According to Bankrate\u2019s latest weekly survey of large lenders, the benchmark 30-year fixed mortgage remained at 3.14% in one week, down 710 basis points year-over-year. Second, the pandemic has forced us to spend more time indoors, causing people to move out or shift to a bigger place to adjust to the new normal of working and learning from home. Purchasing or renting a new home has never been as easy as it is now, thanks to the advanced tech-oriented real estate brokerage companies. The housing industry transactions are gradually becoming remote, reducing the hassles of multiple visits during this tumultuous time. The best performing tech-based housing companies in 2020 are Zillow Group, Inc. (ZG), Redfin Corporation (REDF), PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust (PMT), and Fathom Holdings, Inc. (FTHM), which reported impressive earnings and revenues in the April-June quarter.
