Even though not directly responsible, Robinhood has received its share of criticisms too, with the users making risky decisions and facing the consequences. Leaving controversies aside, the Robinhood 100 List can provide a gauge of where the millennial generation is investing its money. The list is created based on how many users own each stock. Whether stocks on the list are worthy investments or not, is another story. Many stocks on the list could be considered risky investments, but there are some stocks worth considering. Here are three stocks in the Robinhood 100, trading under $10, and worth a look due to their underlying financial strength: Zynga Inc. (ZNGA), Prospect Capital Corporation (PSEC), and Fitbit, Inc. (FIT). 9 \"BUY THE DIP\" Growth Stocks For 2020Zynga Inc.
