Data is considered one of, if not the world\u2019s most valuable commodity. There are three types of Big Data: Volume refers to the amount of date, Velocity is the fast rate at which the data is received, and Variety refers to the many different types of date that are available. Most businesses are now powered by data. The value in data is what a business can do with it. Data can be used to address business problems that companies wouldn\u2019t have been able to deal with before. Companies can also take data and use it for cost reductions and new product development. New trends have created an immense need for Big Data. Technologies such as cloud computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) require a lot of data. Data powers our smartphones and computers. Right now, online education and working from home have created a massive need for data. Over the long-term, new technologies will continue to require a lot of data.
