The major catalysts have been the Fed\u2019s unprecedented interventions, fiscal stimulus, and the weak economy which means that low-interest rates and high deficits will be here for a while. From its March lows, the iShares Silver Trust (SLV) is up 117%. Over the last couple of days, precious metals have given back some of these gains due to Treasury yields rising on increasing optimism that a vaccine will be developed and declining case counts. From recent highs, GLD is down by 7%, while SLV is off about 14%. 7 \"SAFE HAVEN\" Dividend Stocks for Turbulent TimesHowever, the positive fundamentals for precious metals are intact.

These factors will translate into lower interest rates which will be positive for the metal. However, even in bull markets, there can be vicious corrections. Dividend-paying silver stocks are one way that investors can gain exposure to the sector, while locking in an above-average income stream to reduce risk.
