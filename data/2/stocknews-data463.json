The catalyst for this solid performance vs. its peer group was strong demand from E-commerce, as news that the company will be launching \u201cWalmart+\u201d in an aim to compete with Amazon (AMZN) Prime. While it\u2019s early to tell if the company might be able to steal a little market share with its offering, analysts are upbeat on Walmart\u2019s future, with the company\u2019s earnings trend on track to record an earnings breakout year in FY2021. Let\u2019s take a closer look below: 9 \"BUY THE DIP\" Growth Stocks For 2020 (Source: Forbes.com) Walmart released its fiscal Q2 2021 results last week and reported quarterly revenue of $137.7 million, up 5.6% year-over-year. The mid-single-digit growth was driven by 97% growth in E-commerce sales and much solid growth in the Grocery segment, with many consumers stockpiling to avoid multiple trips to the store. Meanwhile, despite Sam\u2019s Club being a lagging segment and relatively small contributor company-wide for Walmart, membership rates soared with the highest quarterly increase in memberships in 5 years. This led to a 7.8% increase in membership income, with COVID-19 having a significant impact on membership trends. Based on the strength in nearly all segments, this was the 2nd best quarter for Walmart\u2019s sales growth in the past two years, and the two-quarter average revenue growth rate jumped to 7.5%. While this growth rate is forecasted to drop to mid-single-digit revenue growth in Q3 and Q4 2021, it is a massive improvement from the FY2020 sales growth rate of just 1.5%. (Source: YCharts.com, Author\u2019s Chart) Looking at Walmart\u2019s earnings trend, this moderate acceleration in sales growth is having a positive impact on annual earnings per share [EPS]. As we can see above, annual EPS is forecasted to come in at $5.35 in FY2021, which would translate to more than 8% growth year-over-year. While this an impressive acceleration sequentially from the flat earnings growth in the year prior ($4.94 vs. $4.92), the real story is that we should see an earnings breakout year. Earnings breakouts occur when annual EPS trades in a range for several years and then makes a new multi-year high, and based on estimates of $5.35, we should see this occur in FY2021. Generally, earnings breakouts are bullish developments, as stocks tend to follow annual EPS long-term. (Source: YCharts.com, Author\u2019s Chart) If we look at the FY2022 and FY2023 estimates, this is not just a temporary bump in annual EPS due to COVID-19, but instead what seems to be a new trend higher. While investors in Walmart have steady returns for years that have barely kept up with the major market averages, this new breakout could finally be the catalyst for Walmart to begin outperforming the S&P-500. The key to this, however, is that we can see revenue growth rates accelerate, and ideally, push closer to the 10% range. In my experience, the best earnings breakouts are those coupled with a material acceleration in revenue growth of at least 10%, and this won\u2019t be an easy feat for Walmart. Therefore, we are going to need to see continued traction in Sam\u2019s Club, and at least some contribution from \u201cWalmart+\u201d to make this happen. I do not think we\u2019ll see the company steal much market share from Amazon despite the lower price point, but even picking up a small slice of market share would be a nice tailwind for annual revenues. (Source: YCharts.com, Author\u2019s Chart) Given that we\u2019ve got an earnings breakout on deck \u2013 is the stock a buy? While the breakout year for earnings in FY2021 is a bullish development, Walmart is not cheap here as it\u2019s trading at nearly 0.7x sales. Typically, the best time to buy the stock has been at 0.50x sales or lower, and moving to underweight Walmart at 0.65x sales or higher has been the wise move. However, given the slight acceleration in revenue growth, we\u2019re seeing, it\u2019s possible that 0.60x sales could be the new buy zone for stock. Unfortunately, even if this is the case, we\u2019re still trading more than 10% above this level, suggesting that new buys at current levels are risky. Having said that, this doesn\u2019t mean the stock is a sell; it just means that I wouldn\u2019t be rushing to buy it at above $131.00. Let\u2019s see what the technical picture looks like: (Source: YCharts.com, Author\u2019s Chart) (Source: TC2000.com) If we take a look at the technical picture above, it\u2019s clear that there are some motivated sellers above $134.00 as we continue to see very weak monthly closes above this area. However, as long as Walmart remains above its key moving average (teal line) on a monthly closing basis, the best move has been to sit tight. Therefore, I see the best course of action here as holding and looking to add exposure on any dip near this moving average, which comes in near the $116.00 level currently. Ultimately, if we see a successful earnings breakout year here, there\u2019s no reason the stock can\u2019t trade up to the $150.00 level in the next 12 months. Walmart is a relatively boring stock that\u2019s struggled to keep up with the major market averages. Still, for long-term investors, the stock continues to a decent staple to round out a portfolio with its 1.6% yield. The good news is that the earnings breakout we\u2019re seeing here in FY2021 may make the stock more attractive to investors as we\u2019ve seen no progress in annual EPS in nearly a decade now. The fact that this is finally changing might attract some new buyers to the Walmart story. Besides, the stock is more insulated than other retailers if we see a prolonged recession given its lower price-point. In summary, while I don\u2019t see any reason to pay up above $131.00 for Walmart, I see the stock as a Hold at current levels for long-term investors. If we were to see a sharp correction in the market that sent Walmart sliding below $117.00 before year-end, this would present a low-risk opportunity to pick up some shares at a more attractive valuation.
