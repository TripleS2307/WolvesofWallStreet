He is one of the most sought-after hedge fund managers and is known for his contrarian investment straetgy. His coronavirus play will go down in history as he turned a $26-million position into $2.6 billion by late March. He primarily used credit protection on investment grade and high yield bond indices to make such a huge gain. He was apprehensive about the potential market crash since the onset of the disease in late February, and he contemplated liquidating his holdings. However, he ended up simply purchasing credit protection policies to limit his losses. 9 \"BUY THE DIP\" Growth Stocks For 2020Ackman even went on national television to warn investors about the disastrous effect the pandemic could have on the markets, as he predicted many equity companies to go bankrupt. Despite receiving widespread criticism for making such bold comments, his vision came true when the benchmark indices started nosediving in early March. By March 23rd, he cashed out his position in these credit contracts to reap a whopping $2.6 billion.
