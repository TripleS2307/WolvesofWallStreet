There\u2019s increasing optimism that a coronavirus vaccine could be developed by the end of the year. And, there\u2019s been progress in therapies that are resulting in better treatment outcomes. One silver lining of this crisis is that it\u2019s highlighted all the innovations that are taken place in the biotechnology sector over the past decade.

Given the aging population of developing countries, the demand for these products is only going to increase. These strong fundamentals are resulting in outperformance for the sector, as the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (IBB) has a YTD return of 14.89% versus the S&P 500\u2019s (SPY) 3.12% loss. 7 \"SAFE HAVEN\" Dividend Stocks for Turbulent TimesHere are three biotechnology stocks positioned to outperform in July: Amgen Inc.
