According to the Nareit Total REIT Industry Tracker Series report, U.S. REIT earnings declined 9% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2020. However, the industry fared relatively well compared to S&P 500, whose earnings declined 13.8% from the year-ago value over the same period. Many REITs responded to this economic crisis tactfully to curtail their losses, especially through cash injections to drive their liquidity. As REITs are highly dependent on debt, the low interest rate environment is also working in their favor. Also, REITs operating in the technology and cloud computing industry fared relatively well, with a strong demand for high speed connectivity throughout the country under the new normal. Most REITs maintained low leverage ratios throughout the pandemic, allowing them to reduce their interest expense and debt repayment burden during this time. Lower debt burden allowed these REITs to stay in business even in the face of financial losses due to the pandemic. With the gradual reopening of the economy, the demand for REITs is increasing. REITs such as Equinix, Inc. (EQIX), Public Storage (PSA), Extra Space Storage, Inc. (EXR), and Innovative Industrial Properties, Inc. (IIPR) are well positioned to soar in the upcoming quarters. 7 Best ETFs for the NEXT Bull MarketEquinix, Inc.
