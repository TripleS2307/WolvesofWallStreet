LULU grew steadily since the market crash in March, and gained more than 200% to hit its 52-week high of $399 on September 2nd since hitting its 52-week low in March. However, the market correction since the first week of September resulted in a 30% decline for the stock. However, despite market volatility, LULU resumed its share buyback program, which was previously halted due to the coronavirus crisis. This is definitely a sign of its financial strength. The company is also planning on manufacturing footwear, as a port of its omnichannel expansion program, which is expected to boost its profits in the upcoming months. However, as the global economy is still struggling with coronavirus, with rising cases in the United States and second wave in recovered countries, the outcome of LULU\u2019s expansion plan is still dubious.
