If shares were to exceed this level, a breakout should occur. WEN is the world\u2019s third-largest quick-service restaurant. The company derives revenues from two sources: sales at company-operated restaurants and franchise-related revenues. WEN has been benefiting from its transition to a franchised business model. As of the second quarter, WEN had more than 6,800 franchisees. While sales have been slowed by the coronavirus pandemic, the company has been benefiting from international expansion and a re-imaging of its restaurants based on its Image Activation goal to improve customer service.

Growth has certainly been slowed with the virus, as both sales and earnings growth fell over the past year. Earnings are expected to grow 27.8% next year, with the hope that that the pandemic dies down leading to more foot traffic. WEN has shown strong near-term momentum rising 13.6% since September 21st.
