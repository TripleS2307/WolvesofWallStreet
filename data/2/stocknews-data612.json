So, identifying stocks in the hardest hit industries and avoiding them is as important as investing stocks with immense upside potential. Among others, the airline and cruise industry were ravaged by the pandemic. It\u2019s hard to predict a reasonable recovery for stocks in these two industries over the short term. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced in mid-July the extension of a no sail order for cruise ships until September 30th, 2020. The airline industry is also experiencing reduced traffic. The only hope for these two industries to get back to pre-COVID business levels is a potential cure or vaccine for the coronavirus. 9 \"BUY THE DIP\" Growth Stocks For 2020The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) has only gained a little over 3% year-to-date.
