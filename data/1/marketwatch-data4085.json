The price move for oil is \u201cmarginal,\u201d given the large amount of output that is shut, said Bjornar Tonhaugen, head of oil markets at Rystad Energy. \u201cToday is more of an opportunity to see that even such a sudden event is weak to really put aside the concerns that Covid-19 has brought upon market participants.\u201d \u201cYes, a dip in oil production provides a breath to traders, who have been seeing global output rising over the last weeks, amid a demand recovery lag, but what will really make a difference is news from the recovery front,\u201d he explained in a daily note. West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery CL.1, -1.62% US:CLV20, the U.S. benchmark, rose 23 cents, or 0.5%, to $42.57 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. October Brent crude UK:BRNV20, the global benchmark, was up 43 cents, or 1%, at $44.78 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe. Based on information submitted by operators, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement on Sunday estimated that 57.6% of current Gulf oil production has been shut in, along with 44.6% of natural-gas output. That equates to around 1.1 million barrels a day of oil output. \u201cWhile there is a focus on oil production at the moment, we will need to keep an eye on refining activity, which is vulnerable to flooding,\u201d said Warren Patterson, head of commodities strategy at ING, in a note, adding that Hurricane Harvey in 2017 saw refinery run rates in the country fall from more than 96% to less than 77%, which led to a strong rally in refined product margins. A storm named Marco temporarily grew into a hurricane Sunday as it moved toward Louisiana. It was subsequently downgraded to a tropical storm Sunday night. Another potential hurricane, Tropical Storm Laura, hit the Dominican Republic and Haiti, and was on track for the same region of the U.S. coast.

Medical experts said the treatment may provide benefits to those battling the disease, but that there isn\u2019t conclusive evidence of its effectiveness, while questions remain about when it should be administered and dosage. Some market watchers, meanwhile, said crude\u2019s gains were restrained by continued concerns over prospects for crude demand as the pandemic continues. \u201cBoth the benchmarks, in fact, retreated by 1% on Friday exactly over concerns on a growing glut [amid] slow demand, meaning Monday\u2019s gains are insignificant in the grander scheme of things,\u201d said Mihir Kapadia, chief executive of Sun Global Investments. \u201cWe can only see solid gains once news of a vaccine emerges, as it will impact the larger economic structure for good.\u201d September natural gas US:NGU20 was up 2.1% at $2.50 per million British thermal units. September gasoline US:RBU20 jumped 4.3% to $1.3393 a gallon, while September heating oil US:HOU20 rallied 3.3% to $1.2473 a gallon. Traders are buying petroleum products ahead of the storm \u201cin case some refineries get flooded or the power goes out,\u201d Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at The Price Futures Group, told MarketWatch. For oil, there is still demand concerns surrounding COVID-19 that \u201cwill be made worse when these storm hit land,\u201d he said. However, if Laura gains strength to become a major hurricane, \u201cit would have the potential to keep production offline longer.\u201d"}]}
