See:Trump praises QAnon conspiracy theorists, says he appreciates their support Also:President Trump welcomes the support, but Lindsey Graham pronounces QAnon \u2018batsh\u2014 crazy\u2019 The hosts of the fundraiser, Caryn and Michael Borland, have shared QAnon memes and retweeted posts from QAnon accounts, their social-media activity shows. The baseless conspiracy theory posits that Trump is fighting entrenched enemies in the government and also involves satanism and child sex trafficking. Beyond Pence, the Sept. 14 fundraiser in Bozeman, Mont., is expected to draw influential figures in the president\u2019s orbit including Kimberly Guilfoyle, a top Trump fundraising official who is dating Donald Trump Jr., GOP chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, Republican National Committee finance chairman Todd Ricketts and RNC co-chairman Tommy Hicks Jr., the event invitation shows. While many Republicans have dismissed QAnon, the fundraiser is another sign of how the conspiracy theory is gaining a foothold in the party. Trump has hailed Georgia congressional candidate Marjorie Taylor Greene, another QAnon supporter, as a \u201cfuture Republican star.\u201d The president has refused to condemn QAnon, recently telling reporters that the conspiracy theory is \u201cgaining in popularity\u201d and that its supporters \u201clike me very much.\u201d See:QAnon supporter who made racist videos wins Republican primary in Georgia Plus:QAnon conspiracy theory is on the ballot in some states this November Representatives for Pence declined to comment on the fundraiser, though the vice president has previously called QAnon a \u201cconspiracy theory.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about QAnon, and I dismiss it out of hand,\u201d he told CBS last month. Representatives for the Trump campaign didn\u2019t immediately comment on the fundraiser. Caryn and Michael Borland did not return a call seeking comment on the event. QAnon is a wide-ranging conspiracy fiction spread largely through the internet, centered on the baseless belief that Trump is waging a secret campaign against enemies in the \u201cdeep state\u201d and a child sex trafficking ring run by satanic pedophiles and cannibals. It is based on cryptic postings by the anonymous \u201cQ,\u201d purportedly a government insider. The story has grown to include other long-standing conspiracy theories, gaining traction among some extreme Trump supporters. The movement is often likened to a right-wing cult; some followers have run for office, primarily in the Republican Party, though some have been independent or run as third-party candidates. Trump has refused to say QAnon is false. The Borlands have shared multiple QAnon social-media posts, as well as other discredited conspiracies. Michael Borland prominently features several QAnon \u201cQ\u201d logos on his Facebook page. One features a flaming \u201cQ\u201d with a Christian cross in the middle. He has also shared the QAnon oath as well as its slogan, which states: \u201cWhere We Go One We Go All.\u201d From his Twitter account, which also features the \u201cQ\u201d logo, he also shared a post that labeled the Black Lives Matter movement \u201cterrorists\u201d and made his own threat to shoot protesters, according to a June 25 post.

In April, she responded to a pro-Trump Tweet from a QAnon account by replying \u201cAlways\u201d with a praying hands emoji. The couple has donated over $220,000 to Trump\u2019s re-election, the bulk of which was made in Caryn Borland\u2019s name. They were guests at the president\u2019s renominating convention last month. They posed for photos from the White House South Lawn, including one that shows Michael Alfaro, a Trump fundraiser from Illinois, in the foreground. Alfaro, who is also slated to attend the Montana fundraiser, responded in the comments: \u201cWorking for the Borland family on South Lawn!\u201d The couple also said they dined with Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, according to a caption on a Aug. 27 Facebook photo of the couple and Paul. Michael Borland also posed for a photo that same day with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California, Borland\u2019s Facebook account shows.
