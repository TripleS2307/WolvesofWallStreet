Net loss for the period was EUR11.13 billion. The results compare with analysts' expectation of a net profit of EUR838 million on revenue of EUR10.60 billion, according to a consensus forecast provided by FactSet. The impairments follow \"a review of the valuation of the bank's goodwill and deferred tax assets (DTAs) given the deterioration in economic outlook due to covid-19,\" it said. They are non-cash, non-recurring impairment. \"This has no impact on the bank's liquidity or credit risk positions, and does not impact the CET1 capital ratio.\" \"The past six months have been among the most challenging in our history,\" Executive Chairman Ana Botin said. The bank's core tier 1 ratio--a key measure of balance-sheet strength--was 11.84% at the end of June, from 11.58% in March. The bank will propose a scrip dividend payable in new shares of 10 Euro cents a share for 2019. \"We reiterate the 13-15% return on tangible equity (RoTE) target we announced at our investor day last year and will provide an update to our strategic plans in the coming months,\" Ms. Botin said."}]}
