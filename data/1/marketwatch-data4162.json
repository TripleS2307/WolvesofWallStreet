The restaurant chain on Tuesday began selling its reduced methane emissions beef Whopper in select restaurants in Miami, New York, Austin, Portland and Los Angeles, while supplies last. Burger King, part of Restaurant Brands International Inc., QSR, -0.60% \u00c2 believes the addition of the herb can reduce each animal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daily methane emissions by about 33%. Cows (and sheep) emit methane as a digestive by-product through flatulence and belching. In fact, Burger King embraced these indelicate bodily functions in its social-media promotion, only the latest of a recent flurry of corporate actions, including from delivery giant Amazon AMZN, +3.01% \u00c2 and others to cash in on changing consumer behavior around climate change. But there is apparently some science behind the marketing move. Burger King worked with the Autonomous University at the State of Mexico and the University of California, Davis to test and develop its formula of adding 100 grams of lemongrass leaves to the cows\u00e2\u0080\u0099 daily diets. Preliminary tests indicate the concoction helps the animals release less methane as they digest their food. Beef industry groups in the past have pointed to scientific developments at the farm level in working toward reducing emissions, even as climate groups continue to up the pressure on the agriculture sector. Greenhouse-gas emissions from the entire agriculture sector, including methane, made up 9.9% of the U.S. total in 2018, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Methane emissions from livestock specifically were roughly a quarter of the emissions from the ag sector.

And both Burger King and McDonald\u00e2\u0080\u0099s have already added meat alternatives to their menus, although that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a much smaller portion of sandwich sales.
