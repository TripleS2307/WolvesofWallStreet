Gabriel Bouys/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images How is the market going to perform over the next several months? While every moment in history may always feel like the most precarious so far, this year\u2019s pandemic and unstabilized geopolitics may mean 2020 is truly a special case. Any one of a number of triggers over the next few months \u2013 a hard Brexit, a contested U.S. election, a COVID-19 vaccine failure \u2013 could prompt a market tumble, like in early March. On the other hand, policy responses, or welcome surprises, may trigger a meltup, like the one that started in late March. There may just be an ETF for that. The Simplify US Equity PLUS Convexity SPYC, +0.83% exchange-traded fund, launched in early September, uses options to offer investors access to the broader stock market, with protection against big swings either way. \u201cThe question you have to ask is, what are markets going to look like for the next six months or so, and anyone who tells you he knows is lying,\u201d said Dave Nadig, chief investment officer and director of research at ETF Database. \u201cFour or five years ago, we\u2019d all have a baseline expectation, with a few variations,\u201d Nadig said in an interview. \u201cNow we\u2019re in a different kind of market. The tails become as likely as the central tendency. SPYC is a product specifically designed for this world where the curve has been squashed, so you can maximize the profit from the tails.\u201d Simplify is a new issuer of ETFs, but it was founded and is run by industry veterans, including Paul Kim and Brian Kelleher, who both spent years at PIMCO, the massive asset manager known for its bond strategies. The two want Simplify to be \u201cthe PIMCO of options,\u201d Kim told MarketWatch. The options strategy works like this: 98% of SPYC\u2019s portfolio is invested in the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% via iShares\u2019 popular and dirt-cheap ETF IVV, +0.87%. The remaining 2% is in puts and calls \u2013 financial instruments that allow the investor to sell and buy the underlying security at certain points in the future at pre-specified prices. That 2% does a lot of heavy lifting. Puts offer downside protection, helping preserve capital, while calls protect against big upside moves. The bigger the market swings, the more those benefits accrue to the portfolio. (That\u2019s a financial markets concept known as \u201cconvexity,\u201d which is the \u201cC\u201d in the ETF\u2019s ticker.) What\u2019s a worst-case scenario for an investor in SPYC? One where markets drift along for a while and don\u2019t go too far up or down. The 2% allocated to the options strategy would be lost \u2013 $100 invested in the fund, say, would become $98. Solving for the problem of the two \u201ctails\u201d isn\u2019t just an ETF industry pet project. It\u2019s top of mind for advisors and investors big and small, Kim notes. Stanley Druckenmiller, the former hedge fund manager now worth billions, told Bloomberg News early in September that the market is in \u201ca raging mania\u201d because of Federal Reserve intervention. Inflation could skyrocket by 5 or 10% over the next few years, he said \u2013 and yet deflation is just as possible. SPYC\u2019s two-tail strategy differentiates it from the \u201clow-volatility\u201d products like the Invesco S&P 500 Low Volatility ETF SPLV, +0.82% and the iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol ETF USMV, +0.64%, which got so-so reviews for their performance through the March mayhem. It\u2019s also distinct from the popular \u201cdefined outcome\u201d products pioneered by companies like Innovator, which offer what Nadig calls \u201cguardrails.\u201d investors in those products give up some upside in exchange for some protection against downside risk, and both parameters are known in advance. Whether or not this is truly a more challenging time or unknowable investing landscape than ever before is up for debate. But one thing is certain: 2020\u2019s market backdrop adds an additional wrinkle. Thanks largely to central bank maneuverings in the wake of the coronavirus crisis, time-tested approaches to managing investment risk may no longer work. Read: The Fed is going to buy ETFs. What does it mean? \u201cOur claim is that bonds are just as risky now,\u201d Kim said. \u201cYou\u2019re getting the return of cash with interest rate and credit risks. Cash could even be less risky than bonds.\u201d Bond valuations TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.777% are near all-time highs and yields near all-time lows. But moving money into cash carries plenty of risk, as well: the S&P 500 is up more than 50% from its late March low. Other traditional safe-haven assets, like gold, are similarly stretched, Nadig argued. Meanwhile, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re more likely in this environment for the foreseeable future than in another because we\u2019ve pulled forward so many decades of monetary policy. I think that we have created so many pro-cyclical, reflexive pockets of the economy that I would argue black swans are becoming gray real fast.\u201d"}]}
