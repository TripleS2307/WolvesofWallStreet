In a highly unusual move, the editors published an editorial that called for the current government to be voted out of office. \u201c Political leaders in the U.S. \u2018have taken a crisis and turned it into a tragedy.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 New England Journal of Medicine \u201cThis crisis has produced a test of leadership,\u201d said the editorial. \u201cWith no good options to combat a novel pathogen, countries were forced to make hard choices about how to respond. Here in the United States, our leaders have failed that test. They have taken a crisis and turned it into a tragedy.\u201d The U.S. leads the world in number of cases at 7.6 million and by deaths at 211,834, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University, far exceeding the numbers of countries with bigger and even more vulnerable populations, the journal\u2019s editors wrote. \u201cThe death rate in this country is more than double that of Canada, exceeds that of Japan, a country with a vulnerable and elderly population, by a factor of almost 50, and even dwarfs the rates in lower-middle-income countries, such as Vietnam, by a factor of almost 2000. Covid-19 is an overwhelming challenge, and many factors contribute to its severity. But the one we can control is how we behave. And in the United States we have consistently behaved poorly,\u201d the editors wrote.

Despite ample warning, the country failed to implement adequate and effective testing or even provide the basic personal protective equipment to safeguard health-care workers and the general public. The U.S. lags countries such as Kazakhstan, Zimbabwe and Ethiopia, which do not have America\u2019s biomedical infrastructure or manufacturing capacity, in terms of the number of tests performed per infected person. Don\u2019t miss:Trump\u2019s vaccine czar says the first vaccine should be submitted for emergency authorization around Thanksgiving The U.S. failed to institute quarantine and isolation measures on time and consistently, rules on social distancing remain loose and inconsistent, and restrictions were lifted too early and long before disease control had been achieved. Public messaging on face-mask wearing has been politicized, the journal lamented. The nation\u2019s key public health agencies, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration have been politicized, too, or excluded from crucial decision making, greatly undermining trust in them, according to the journal. Don\u2019t miss: Expert calls for \u2018radical transparency\u2019 on Trump\u2019s coronavirus treatment and progress as more in president\u2019s circle test positive \u201cWhen it comes to the response to the largest public health crisis of our time, our current political leaders have demonstrated that they are dangerously incompetent,\u201d the editorial concluded. \u201cWe should not abet them and enable the deaths of thousands more Americans by allowing them to keep their jobs.\u201d The comments come after Mike Pence and Kamala Harris clashed over the Trump administration\u2019s handling of the crisis at Wednesday night\u2019s vice-presidential debate, with Harris labeling it \u201cthe greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country.\u201d Read now: Trump says he won\u2019t debate Biden next week in virtual format The U.S. counted 52,523 new cases of COVID-19 on Wednesday, and at least 994 people died, according to a New York Times tracker.
