To get this column each market day, click here. Broadly speaking, the U.S. benchmarks are acting well technically, though amid increasingly sideways late-July price action. Nonetheless, range-bound is bullish, against the prevailing backdrop, and the S&P 500\u2019s intermediate-term path of least resistance continues to point higher. Before detailing the U.S. markets\u2019 wider view, the S&P 500\u2019s SPX, +0.87% hourly chart highlights the past two weeks. As illustrated, the S&P has staged an orderly pullback from five-month highs. The downturn punctuates a successful test of support matching the 3,200 mark. Conversely, a familiar overhead inflection point matches the June peak (3,233) and the 2019 close (3,230). Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% remains range-bound. Still, the sideways price action punctuates a decisive mid-July breakout, better illustrated on the daily chart. The prevailing range marks a bullish continuation pattern. True to recent form, the Nasdaq Composite\u2018s COMP, +1.39% near-term backdrop is comparably jagged. Nonetheless, the index has weathered a respectable pullback from last week\u2019s record high (10,840). Consider that last week\u2019s low (10,217) closely matched support at the June peak (10,221). Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has whipsawed of late near record highs. Recall that last week\u2019s close marked just the second close under the 20-day moving average, currently 10,462, since April 3. Still, the index has maintained the more important breakout point (10,131), an area followed by the ascending 50-day moving average. Delving deeper, likely last-ditch support matches the February peak (9,838). The Nasdaq\u2019s intermediate-term bias remains bullish barring a violation. Looking elsewhere, the Dow Jones Industrial Average continues to digest its decisive mid-July breakout. The late-month range is a bullish continuation pattern, positioning it to build on the initial spike. To reiterate, major support broadly spans from 26,236 to 26,294, levels matching the 200-day moving average and the June gap. Conversely, resistance broadly spans from 27,071 to 27,102, levels matching the July and March peaks. Separately, notice the pending golden cross \u2014 or bullish 50-day/200-day moving average crossover \u2014 an event that will likely signal next week. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has pulled in modestly from the July peak. The downturn has been underpinned by the 3,200 mark, a level better illustrated on the hourly chart. The bigger picture Collectively, the bigger-picture technicals remain constructive, though the prevailing backdrop is not one-size-fits all. On a headline basis, the S&P 500 and Dow industrials are digesting early-July breakouts, while the Nasdaq Composite continues to whipsaw near record territory. Amid the cross currents, each benchmark\u2019s intermediate-term bias remains bullish. Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF remains in flatlining mode, digesting a decisive break atop the 200-day moving average. The initial strong-volume spike marked a two standard deviation breakout, and has been punctuated by a tight range amid decreased volume. Bullish price action. Meanwhile, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 ETF has also sustained a modest break atop the 200-day moving average. Combined, the small- and mid-cap benchmarks are rising from support closely matching the 50-day moving average. Looking elsewhere, the SPDR Trust S&P 500 has pulled in from five-month highs. The downturn places it under the breakout point \u2014 the 323.20-to-323.40 area \u2014 detailed repeatedly. Tuesday\u2019s early session high (323.20) matched resistance to the decimal. A retest remains underway. Placing a finer point on the S&P 500, the index continues to act well in the broad sweep. The prevailing downturn from five-month highs has been orderly, underpinned by the 3,200 mark. Friday\u2019s session low (3,200.05) matched the round number, an area that has offered support across nine straight sessions. More broadly, the 50-day moving average, currently 3,119, closely matches gap support (3,123), an area also detailed on the hourly chart. This is followed by the late-June low (2,999.7) matching the 3,000 mark. An eventual close under this area would mark a \u201clower low\u201d \u2014 combined with a violation of the 50-day \u2014 raising a caution flag. Delving deeper, the late-2019 breakout point (2,954) and June low (2,965) continue to mark likely last-ditch support. Collectively, the S&P 500\u2019s intermediate-term bias remains bullish barring a violation of the areas detailed. An orderly late-July consolidation phase remains underway.

Drilling down further, the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF SMH, +1.71% continues to trend higher, rising to tag a nominal all-time high.

Looking elsewhere, the SPDR S&P Mining and Metals ETF is showing signs of life technically. (Yield = 1.9%.) As illustrated, the group has edged atop the 200-day moving average, a level that capped the February and June peaks. The slight breakout raises the flag to a potential primary trend shift. Still, a retest of the June peak (23.87) remains underway. An eventual close higher would mark a \u201chigher high\u201d \u2014 combined with the break atop the 200-day \u2014 more firmly signaling a trend shift. Conversely, the prevailing upturn originates from trendline support closely tracking the 50-day moving average. A sustained posture atop the trendline signals a bullish bias. Beyond the U.S., the iShares MSCI South Korea ETF is pressing five-month highs. (Yield = 2.3%.) The prevailing upturn comes from a tight July range \u2014 a coiled spring \u2014 laying the groundwork for a potentially decisive breakout. Separately, notice the recent golden cross \u2014 or bullish 50-day/200-day moving average crossover \u2014 signaling that the intermediate-term uptrend has overtaken the longer-term trend.

Underlying the upturn, its relative strength index (not illustrated) has registered two-year highs, improving the chances of upside follow-through. Tactically, the 200-day is closely followed by the breakout point, circa 118.00. The prevailing rally attempt is intact barring a violation.
