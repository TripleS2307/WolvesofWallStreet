Which means you must never abandon the public-health approach.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Fauci has said he was hopeful that a coronavirus vaccine could be developed by early 2021, but has previously said it\u2019s unlikely that a vaccine will deliver 100% immunity; he said the best realistic outcome, based on other vaccines, would be 70% to 75% effective. The measles vaccine, he said, is among the most effective by providing 97% immunity. Reviews of past studies have found that, on average, the flu vaccine is about 50% to 60% effective for healthy adults who are between 18 and 64 years old, according to a review of studies by the Mayo Clinic. \u201cThe vaccine may sometimes be less effective,\u201d it said. \u201cEven when the vaccine doesn\u2019t completely prevent the flu, it may lessen the severity of your illness.\u201d Fauci advocates face masks, social distancing and avoiding bars and indoor spaces with crowds. \u201cIf we do those things \u2014 and I\u2019m going to repeat it until I\u2019m exhausted \u2014 those things work,\u201d he said on Friday\u2019s live stream. \u201cWhen you have something that needs everybody pulling at the same time, if you have one weak link in there that doesn\u2019t do it, it doesn\u2019t allow you to get to the end game.\u201d Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said last month that the agency would green light a coronavirus vaccine as long as it\u2019s 50% effective. \u201cWe all want a vaccine tomorrow, that\u2019s unrealistic, and we all want a vaccine that\u2019s 100% effective, again unrealistic. We said 50%.\u201d Hahn added, \u201cThat was a reasonable floor given the pandemic.\u201d As people get used to living with coronavirus, social distancing and mask protocols are also easing. The U.S. has the world\u2019s highest number of COVID-19 cases (5,151,369) and deaths (164,690), followed by Brazil (103,026), Mexico (53,929) and the U.K. (46,611). As of Wednesday, there have been 20,391,697 confirmed cases of coronavirus worldwide and 741,423 deaths. The Dow Jones Industrial Index DJIA, +0.56%, S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% and Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39% were trading up Wednesday as investors awaited progress on round two of a fiscal stimulus during the coronavirus pandemic. The number of coronavirus cases is still rising in every region of the country. With 10,649 deaths, California is now the third U.S. state to register over 10,000 deaths after New York (32,787 deaths) and New Jersey (15,890 deaths). Texas has the fourth highest number of fatalities (9,225). Related: Feeling lax about masks? Think again. Here\u2019s how many lives could be saved if everyone wore a mask \u2014 starting today President Trump signed four executive orders on Saturday that include extending unemployment benefits after Congress failed to reach a deal on a stimulus package. In the absence of a vaccine, health experts say social distancing and masks are the only alternative as \u201cherd immunity\u201d \u2014 where those who are immune protect the most vulnerable in the population \u2014 is not feasible for coronavirus. That requires a very high level of population immunity for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, and for the virus to not mutate. \u201cNone of those seem to be operational at present,\u201d Gregory Poland, who studies the immunogenetics of vaccines at the Mayo Clinic, told MarketWatch in April. \u201cWith influenza, you need herd immunity of 60% to 70%. With measles, you need about 95%. With COVID-19, it\u2019s somewhere in the middle,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen during the pandemic is a lot of preprints and press releases,\u201d Hahn said in a separate interview with the medical journal JAMA. \u201cWe can\u2019t make a decision based upon a preprint or a press release, and that\u2019s because we insist upon seeing all of the raw clinical trial data.\u201d Traditionally, such research goes through a peer-review vetting process before publication. \u201c \u2018With influenza, you need herd immunity of 60% to 70%. With measles, you need about 95%. With COVID-19, it\u2019s somewhere in the middle.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Gregory Poland, who studies the immunogenetics of vaccines at the Mayo Clinic In the meantime, the public should continue to wear masks, authorities say. America\u2019s COVID-19 death toll in the U.S. could reach nearly 300,000 by Dec. 1, but consistent mask-wearing beginning today could save approximately 70,000 lives, according to projections released last week from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington\u2019s School of Medicine. \u201cIt appears that people are wearing masks and socially distancing more frequently as infections increase, then after a while as infections drop, people let their guard down and stop taking these measures to protect themselves and others which, of course, leads to more infections,\u201d HME director Christopher Murray said, \u201cand the potentially deadly cycle starts over again.\u201d In April \u2014 after two months of obfuscation over the efficacy of face masks, during which New York City became the epicenter of the pandemic in the U.S., and one month after the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic \u2014 U.S. federal authorities did a U-turn and said all Americans should, after all, wear face coverings in public settings, and be aware of asymptomatic carriers. So how contagious is someone who has contracted COVID-19 \u2014 yet displays no symptoms? This study, published in the medical journal JAMA Internal Medicine this week, provides one theory for the first question. It isolated 303 patients with COVID-19 in a treatment center in South Korea. Of those, 110 (36%) were asymptomatic and 21 (19%) developed symptoms during isolation. What they found: \u201cMany individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection remained asymptomatic for a prolonged period, and viral load was similar to that in symptomatic patients,\u201d the scientists concluded. \u201cTherefore, isolation of infected persons should be performed regardless of symptoms.\u201d The researchers analyzed swabs taken from the group between March 6 and March 26."}]}
