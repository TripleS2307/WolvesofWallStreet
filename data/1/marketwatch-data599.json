And some, including philanthropist Melinda Gates, have weighed a controversial idea: moving people of color, whose communities have been disproportionately stricken by the disease, toward the front of the queue. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told states recently that they should be ready to distribute a coronavirus vaccine by Nov. 1. And in one of three planning documents first reported by the New York Times, the CDC told health officials in states, territories and five big U.S. cities to \u201cidentify and estimate sizes of critical populations, particularly those to receive first available doses,\u201d as well as other groups that might need special consideration for distribution and expanded access. Those populations include essential workers working in sectors such as health care, national security, education and food; people living in group settings; people at heightened risk for severe COVID-19 illness, including those aged 65 and older, people with underlying conditions, tribal community members, residents of long-term care facilities, and \u201cpeople from racial and ethnic minority populations,\u201d according to the document. Research shows that Black and Latino people bear a disproportionate share of COVID-19 illness and death in the U.S. People of color are also overrepresented in essential jobs that require them to work outside the home. They are more likely to have underlying health conditions that can lead to more severe cases of the coronavirus, less likely to have health insurance, and more likely to report experiencing discrimination within the health-care system. Meanwhile, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine released a draft framework this week for how to equitably allocate a vaccine. The experts who compiled the 114-page draft, co-sponsored by the CDC and soliciting public comment through Sept. 4, said they had opted to focus on the underlying causes of racial and ethnic COVID-19 disparities rather than on \u201cdiscrete racial or ethnic categories.\u201d \u201cCurrently there is little evidence that this is biologically mediated, but rather reflects the impact of systemic racism leading to higher rates of co-morbidities that increase the severity of COVID-19 infection and the socioeconomic factors that increase likelihood of acquiring the infection, such as having front line jobs, crowded living conditions, lack of access to personal protective equipment, and inability to work from home,\u201d the National Academies said in a press release. In response to a request for comment on an earlier New York Times report about discussions of prioritizing Black and Latino Americans in an eventual vaccine rollout, CDC spokeswoman Jasmine Reed in July highlighted the agency\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), \u201cthe federal advisory board, consisting of scientific and medical experts from across the country, that makes recommendations to the agency\u2019s director on the routine use of vaccines.\u201d \u201cThe ACIP board has created a work group to review data on COVID-19 vaccine candidates and consider a recommendation to CDC,\u201d Reed told MarketWatch. \u201cA portion of the group\u2019s work will involve determining if there are priority groups that should get vaccinated based on occupation, risk of serious outcomes and health disparities.\u201d\u2018Race is just a proxy\u2019 None of the experts who spoke with MarketWatch in July advocated for prioritizing vaccine access based solely on race and ethnicity. But some saw value in considering race as an indicator for other factors, such as income and education, that aren\u2019t readily apparent in the data being collected. Monica Peek, a University of Chicago associate professor of medicine who researches health disparities, said she favored first vaccinating the populations that have been hardest hit by the coronavirus and are at increased risk for exposing others. \u201c \u2018Race is just a proxy for the social conditions and the structural racism and interpersonal racism that puts people at increased risk for the coronavirus.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Monica Peek, a University of Chicago associate professor of medicine who researches health disparities That means people living in congregate living facilities such as nursing homes and prisons, essential workers without the ability to work from home, and, yes, racial and ethnic minorities living in densely populated areas that make it difficult to practice social distancing, she said. Public-health professionals now know \u201cthat the coronavirus has disproportionately ravaged its way through marginalized communities,\u201d she said. But it\u2019s important for people to understand why race should be a factor, Peek added \u2014 after all, it\u2019s not the color of a person\u2019s skin that puts them at increased risk for COVID-19. Rather, their brown or Black skin puts them at increased risk for racism, which in turn puts them at greater risk for the virus, she said. \u201cRace is just a proxy for the social conditions and the structural racism and interpersonal racism that puts people at increased risk for the coronavirus,\u201d Peek said. \u201cThe reason that race enters the equation is because of the increased risk for exposure to the coronavirus in the first place \u2014 not because we\u2019re saying that brown and Black people in and of themselves deserve extra benefits.\u201d Melody Goodman, the associate dean for research and an associate professor of biostatistics at the NYU School of Global Public Health, who studies health disparities, also said she wouldn\u2019t base vaccine prioritization on race and ethnicity alone. But she agreed that race could serve as a proxy for other data points that aren\u2019t available, such as income, education and racism \u2014 one \u201cquick question\u201d that helps get at other questions. \u201cIt\u2019s all of those things that we know correlate with race, but it\u2019s not someone\u2019s racial or ethnic makeup,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cBut the way our society is set up, if you said race, you probably have a good bucket of people who are vulnerable.\u201d If Goodman were in charge of implementing an early COVID-19 vaccine rollout, she said, she would use a place-based approach \u2014 likely at a ZIP-code level \u2014 that targeted low-income and medically underserved communities; communities with a high proportion of racial and ethnic minorities; and prisons, nursing homes and other densely populated institutionalized settings. She would also target jobs in which workers\u2019 frequent movements help the virus spread more easily, such as meatpacking workers, delivery drivers, postal workers and transit workers. \u201cIt just so happens that a lot of these workers are Black and brown, not that there\u2019s not non-minorities in these groups,\u201d Goodman said.Prioritizing COVID-19 vaccine access by race or ethnicity could create stigma Georges Benjamin, the executive director of the American Public Health Association and former secretary of the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, said he believes fast-tracking vaccine access solely by race and ethnicity could be \u201cstigmatizing\u201d and might not result in the right groups being prioritized. \u201c \u2018It\u2019s stigmatizing to the African-American community to say we\u2019re more risky because of who we are than what we do.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Georges Benjamin, the executive director of the American Public Health Association \u201cIt says that people are at risk because of their skin color, which isn\u2019t the case \u2014 they\u2019re at risk because they have public-facing jobs, chronic diseases, and other social determinants that put them at risk,\u201d Benjamin told MarketWatch. \u201cAnd we have to be very careful \u2014 this is not a Black disease. People should not be concerned about African Americans being more infectious than anybody else.\u201d In other words, \u201cit\u2019s stigmatizing to the African-American community to say we\u2019re more risky because of who we are than what we do,\u201d Benjamin said. Instead, he said, he would prioritize access based on risk factors such as occupation, susceptibility to disease, age and income, and identify health-care providers and delivery systems that are more likely to serve those populations. Swapna Reddy, a clinical assistant professor at Arizona State University\u2019s College of Health Solutions who researches how to reduce health disparities, said that while she thought the conversation around race and ethnicity was well-intentioned, it painted the problem with too broad a brush. It\u2019s more important to look upstream at the factors that put many people of color at greater risk for hospitalization and death from COVID-19 in the first place, she suggested, such as overrepresentation in low-wage jobs that offer less opportunity for social distancing; preexisting health conditions; and social determinants like poor access to health care and preventive care, food deserts and substandard housing. \u201cThat\u2019s where the inequity originates, and that\u2019s really, to me, the conversation that\u2019s more important,\u201d Reddy said. \u201cIf we have a real intention to actually do something now, especially also as we\u2019re having these larger conversations nationally about systemic racism [and] systemic inequities, then we have to make the changes at the systemic level \u2014 or we\u2019re just going to continue to experience all of these inequities on loop.\u201d (Some Native American communities, including in Reddy\u2019s home state of Arizona, have also been particularly hard hit by the pandemic, she pointed out.) In the present, Reddy said she would focus on implementing available and evidence-based harm-reduction methods, testing, and ensuring accessible and affordable health care in these communities. She would also provide \u201csupport for concurrent other disparities taking place and exacerbated by the fallout from the pandemic,\u201d such as food, housing and child care, and connect people with other available safety-net programs, she said. Both Benjamin and Reddy also suggested that early access to a COVID-19 vaccine could make racial and ethnic minorities feel like they\u2019re the subjects of an experiment. \u201cI\u2019m very cringey at this suggestion regarding giving the vaccine that hasn\u2019t been distributed at the population level to brown and Black folks,\u201d Reddy said. \u201cAs well-intentioned as it might be \u2026 it almost feels like it\u2019s being tried out on them.\u201dBlack Americans have longstanding mistrust of the health-care system Black Americans\u2019 mistrust of the health-care system has been \u201cwell-earned,\u201d Peek said, and isn\u2019t limited to the lasting impact of the 1932 to 1972 Tuskegee experiment, during which the U.S. government allowed Black men to die from syphilis after withholding treatment. Peek points to J. Marion Sims, the so-called father of gynecology, who during the 19th century experimented on enslaved Black women without using anesthesia. There are more recent examples, she added, such as COVID-19 prison conditions for incarcerated Americans, who are still disproportionately Black and brown \u2014 and, reportedly, the use of Oregon prison labor to clean laundry from medical facilities. \u201c \u2018I am concerned about the distrust, rightfully so, that Black and brown communities have in our government and how disenfranchised some communities feel from our government at the moment \u2014 particularly if our government is going to be the one to push for people to take the vaccine.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Melody Goodman, an associate professor of biostatistics at the NYU School of Global Public Health Meanwhile, some 49% of U.S. adults on average say they would get a COVID-19 vaccine if it became available, according to an AP-NORC poll conducted in May. But just 25% of Black people and 37% of Hispanic people say they would get the vaccine, compared with 56% of white people. \u201cI am concerned about the distrust, rightfully so, that Black and brown communities have in our government and how disenfranchised some communities feel from our government at the moment \u2014 particularly if our government is going to be the one to push for people to take the vaccine,\u201d Goodman said.Any COVID-19 vaccine needs a strong educational campaign \u201cWe can make a great vaccine, but if we don\u2019t have the community buy-in \u2014 people willing to take that vaccine \u2014 we actually don\u2019t have a great vaccine,\u201d Goodman said. That means that once a safe, effective vaccine is developed, there must be a substantial public-health investment in educational campaigns that explain the vaccine\u2019s safety profile and side effects; who should get it; and whether the drug has been tested on people of different races and ethnicities, ages and body compositions, said Goodman, who also recommended offering the vaccine for free. These campaigns should explain what a vaccine is, how it\u2019s produced, what it prevents from happening, and how it\u2019s delivered, Benjamin added. At the same time, public-health officials will be up against broader anti-vaccination sentiment in the U.S., Goodman said, as well as existing skepticism and misconceptions about the influenza vaccine. \u201cThis whole environment of not trusting the media, not trusting scientists \u2014 it could really backfire on us when it\u2019s time to roll out a vaccine,\u201d she said. Especially in densely populated areas like New York City, where Goodman lives, COVID-19 has demonstrated how interconnected people are with one another, she said \u2014 and \u201cif communities of color don\u2019t get [a vaccine], it\u2019s not just going to be communities of color who are affected.\u201d Consider, for example, that people of all races and socioeconomic backgrounds ride the subway. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to work if only the rich people get vaccinated,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cIf everyone\u2019s not protected, then no one is really protected.\u201d This story was originally published on July 16, 2020 and has been updated."}]}
