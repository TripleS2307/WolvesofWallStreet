AMZN, +3.01% on Wednesday announced a one-year moratorium on police use of its facial-recognition technology, called Rekognition. \"We've advocated that governments should put in place stronger regulations to govern the ethical use of facial recognition technology, and in recent days, Congress appears ready to take on this challenge,\" Amazon said in a statement. \"We hope this one-year moratorium might give Congress enough time to implement appropriate rules, and we stand ready to help if requested.\" The Seattle-based company, however, said it will continue to let groups combating human trafficking use its facial-recognition technology. Amazon's action comes two days after International Business Machines Corp. IBM, -2.81% said it was exiting the facial-recognition business."}]}
