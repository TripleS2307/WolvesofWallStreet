TSLA, +1.89% to report a profit when it reports second-quarter earnings on Wednesday, eventually resulting in the company joining the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87%. The S&P 500 inclusion \"is already considered a fait accompli among the bulls,\" Ives said in a note Monday. \"While Street numbers are all over the map and looking for red ink this quarter, we are modeling profitability with the 90k delivery number\" and ongoing cost cutting \"getting Musk & Co. away from the red ink,\" he said. Besides profitability, investors will be looking to hear more about China sales, an outlook for Model 3 demand in the second half of the year, any hints around Battery Day, Ives said. The analyst kept his rating on Tesla shares at the equivalent of hold. \"This quarter is another step forward in the Tesla story as Musk & Co. must deliver to match euphoric Street expectations baked into the stock,\" he said. Tesla reports after the bell with a call with analysts scheduled for 5:30 p.m. Eastern. FactSet consensus calls for an adjusted loss of 14 cents a share on sales of $5.15 billion."}]}
