TOL, +1.21% rose 0.4% in premarket trading Monday, after the luxury home builder said that midway through its fiscal fourth quarter, from Aug. 1 through Sept. 15, net signed contracts more than doubled (up 110%) to 1,678 home from 800 homes in the same period a year ago. \"We attribute the accelerated buyer demand to a number of factors, including historically low interest rates, a continued undersupply of homes, and a growing desire for a home that can be personalized for today's evolving lifestyles,\" said Chief Executive Douglas Yearley. He said the company is continuing to raise prices to manage the pace of growth, offset rising costs and to maximize profitability. The stock's premarket rise comes despite an expected selloff in the broader stock market, as futures ES00, +1.13% for the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% sank 1.5%."}]}
