He wrote that Tesla's recent rally, which has seen the stock climb more than 130% on the year, doesn't adequately reflect the potential for a deterioration in U.S.-China relations that could \"disproportionately\" impact Tesla relative to the other automotive companies Jonas covers, in his view. Jonas also worries about recent \"strategic moves in transportation and mobility\" made by big tech firms, which could represent new competition for Tesla over time. More immediately, he's concerned about challenges related to restarting the Fremont facility and recent price cuts in China and the U.S. \"Risk to short-term pricing dynamics represents the entirely of our price target change today,\" Jonas wrote, as he lowered his price target to $650 from $680. Goldman Sachs also downgraded Tesla's stock Friday, moving to a neutral rating on the name. Tesla shares are up 1.5% in Friday trading and they've added 76% over the past three months as the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% has lost 24%."}]}
