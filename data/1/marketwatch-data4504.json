TMUS, +1.50% issued a prospectus Wednesday detailing a rights offering for up to 19.75 million shares of the company's common stock. The subscription rights are worth up to $2.03 billion. The company said that the total number of outstanding shares of its common stock before and after the rights offering will stay the same, so existing shareholders that don't opt to execute their right will not see dilution. T-Mobile plans to use the net proceeds from the rights offering to purchase an equal number of issued and outstanding shares of its common stock from a Softbank Group Corp. subsidiary, which, prior to the offering, holds more than 24% of T-Mobile's common stock. Softbank ultimately \"is expected to dispose of\" up to 198,314,426 shares of T-Mobile's common stock through the rights offering, a private placement of cash mandatory exchangeable trust securities, an underwritten registered offering, and a sale to Marcelo Claure, a T-Mobile director. T-Mobile shares are up 0.4% in premarket trading Wednesday. They've gained 36% over the past three months as the S&P 500 [S: SPX] has risen 28%."}]}
