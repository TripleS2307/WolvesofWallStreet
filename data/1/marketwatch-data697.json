The company wasted little time beefing up its consumer business after falling short in its attempt to buy the U.S. business of TikTok. With the ZeniMax Media acquisition, it sees room to enhance its Game Pass streaming service by adding Bethesda\u00e2\u0080\u0099s franchises, including \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Elder Scrolls\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cFallout.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Microsoft\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stock MSFT, +2.48% was down 0.6% in midday trading Monday.

He said that the deal makes sense strategically heading into Microsoft\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009chighly anticipated new console release\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that it highlights how Microsoft \u00e2\u0080\u009crecognizes its need for consumer-based revenue growth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which this acquisition could help drive. Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella said in a release that \u00e2\u0080\u009cquality differentiated content is the engine behind the growth and value of Xbox Game Pass,\u00e2\u0080\u009d while heralding gaming as \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe most expansive category in the entertainment industry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The company intends to bring existing Bethesda titles to Game Pass and add future games to the service on the same day that they launch for Xbox and PC. Microsoft anticipates that the ZeniMax Media deal will close in the second half of fiscal 2021 and that it will have \u00e2\u0080\u009cminimal impact\u00e2\u0080\u009d on the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operating income for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022.

Materne argued that gaming could become the \u00e2\u0080\u009cthird pillar\u00e2\u0080\u009d of Microsoft\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investment narrative in the coming years as gaming-as-a-service becomes a more prominent part of the industry. In that world, \u00e2\u0080\u009cvendors that can provide gamers with a unique experience through the combination of having great content and a great platform are best positioned to take share in the $109 billion gaming market,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote, while maintaining an outperform rating and $250 price target on Microsoft\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stock.
