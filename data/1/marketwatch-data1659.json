The haul exceeds what is believed to be the previous monthly fundraising record for a White House campaign of $193 million, set by Barack Obama in September 2008, the report added. President Donald Trump's re-election campaign and its affiliates raised more money than Biden in July, but the two campaigns recently have shown roughly the same amount of cash on hand."}]}
