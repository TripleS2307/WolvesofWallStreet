Mladen Antonov/AFP via Getty Images President Trump claimed without evidence at the first presidential debate that mail-in voting during the upcoming election would be rife with fraud, but the process is forging ahead: Several states have expanded opportunities to vote by mail during the pandemic, and some 72 million voters across the country have requested or been sent absentee ballots. While studies suggest that mail-in voting fraud \u00e2\u0080\u0094 like voting fraud in general \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is rare, the process does leave some room for user error: About 1% of absentee ballots that were returned and submitted for counting in the 2016 election were rejected, according to a report by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, an independent, bipartisan commission.\u00c2 The most common pitfalls, according to the report: \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe signature on the ballot not matching the signature on the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s records,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cballot not received on time/missed deadline\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cno voter signature.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Other reasons for rejection included \u00e2\u0080\u009cvoter voted in person,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cno witness signature\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cproblem with return materials.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Meanwhile, the number of mail-in ballots thrown out during this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s primaries in 23 states surpassed the number of absentee and mail ballots rejected during the 2016 general election, the Washington Post reported.\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a very safe vote method if you know the rules and if you follow them correctly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Enrijeta Shino, an assistant professor of political science at the University of North Florida who studies elections and voting behavior, told MarketWatch. But \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe burden is on voters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 responsibility to follow through and be careful,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added, especially without a poll worker there to help sort out the details. Research co-authored by Shino this year found that newly registered voters, racial and ethnic minorities, and younger voters in Georgia were disproportionately likely to have their mail ballots rejected during the 2018 midterm elections. Confused about the process? For starters, make sure you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re registered to vote at your current address, especially if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve moved during the pandemic. Most states, including some that are allowing voters to use COVID-19 as an excuse, are letting eligible voters cast ballots by mail in the 2020 election. But the question of whether voters are automatically mailed ballots, automatically mailed applications for mail-in ballots, or must obtain the application themselves varies by state, as do the deadlines. Voters in five states must still provide a non-COVID-19-related excuse to cast an absentee ballot. Once you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got your ballot, here are the most common scenarios in which your mail vote could be invalidated \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as well as strategies for how to avoid them: \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098It might be a perfectly filled-out ballot and return envelope \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter, because it is considered late.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Enrijeta Shino, an assistant professor of political science at the University of North Florida You didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t return your ballot on time \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you want to vote by mail, do not wait until the last minute,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tappan Vickery, the director of voter engagement for the nonpartisan voter-participation group HeadCount, told MarketWatch. After all, Shino added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit might be a perfectly filled-out ballot and return envelope \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter, because it is considered late.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pay attention to the dates by which ballots in your state must be postmarked and received by the elections office, Vickery said, and return your ballot as soon as possible. HeadCount\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tool lets you look up rules and deadlines for early and mail-in voting in your state. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGet it done early and in the mail no later than [Oct.] 20th,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she suggested. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd if you can get it in earlier, try.\u00e2\u0080\u009d If you haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mailed your completed ballot by then, Vickery said, try to return it in person to your local elections office, polling place or ballot drop box. Rules for returning ballots in person vary by state, so check what your state allows. If you plan to have someone else return your completed ballot on your behalf, make sure that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s allowed in your state, Vickery said. Take advantage of the ballot-tracking systems available in most states, she added, and be proactive about contacting your local elections office if you have any concerns.Your signature doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t match Some people forget to sign their ballot where indicated or use a signature that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t match their voter registration record, Vickery said. A handful of states also require the signature of a witness, a rule that already appears to have caused some confusion since early voting began. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA lot of times people vote their ballot, throw it in there, sign it in haste and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t read all the instructions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Vickery said. Like many other aspects of voting by mail, signature requirements are state-specific, she added. If you registered to vote at the DMV, your signature on file might match the one on your driver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s license. If you registered through a standard voter-registration form, your signature would match that record. And if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember what signature you provided, you can check the rules in your area for updating the signature your state has on file, Vickery said. Some states also have a process to \u00e2\u0080\u009ccure\u00e2\u0080\u009d signature discrepancies, during which they will notify you of a signature problem and give you a chance to rectify it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in a state that has a cure period, pick up your phone, because your local elections office is going to call you from a weird number that you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know and tell you have to do it by a certain day,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Vickery said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pay attention, you could miss an opportunity to address a signature challenge.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Of course, taking advantage of a chance to fix your signature means you need to have sent in your ballot with some time to spare, Shino added \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not waited until the last day possible.You didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use the correct envelopes to return the ballot Pay close attention to instructions for the envelopes provided with your ballot. These envelopes are designed to give voters privacy, not make it harder to vote, Vickery said\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but they can still prove challenging for some people. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you blow through it, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to miss a detail and your ballot is going to get tossed out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added. \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t drop your coffee on it; don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t write on the edge. If you have personal commentary on a candidate, do not write it on your ballot around your vote.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Tappan Vickery, the director of voter engagement for HeadCount For example, Pennsylvania requires voters to put their completed ballot into a secrecy envelope, place the secrecy envelope into a larger return envelope, and then sign the back of the return envelope. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you forget to put your ballot into the little envelope before you put it into the big envelope,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Vickery said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour ballot is disqualified.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Make sure you put a stamp on your return envelope if your state is one of the many that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t prepay postage for mail-in ballots.You didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pay close enough attention to the little things Stick to black or dark blue ink, Vickery said, and be sure to completely fill in the ovals on your ballot. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mark them with check marks or Xs. Follow instructions for verifying your ballot, which might include submitting a copy of your photo ID with your completed ballot. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSlow down and read all the instructions; have somebody check it for you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Vickery said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t assume you know how it works. Make sure you take your time with it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Remember that your ballot will be read by a machine. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLike any Scantron, if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been damaged, if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not flat, there is the opportunity that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not going to go through the machine properly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Vickery said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo absolutely don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t drop your coffee on it; don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t write on the edge. If you have personal commentary on a candidate, do not write it on your ballot around your vote.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2 If your ballot gets stray marks on it, call your local elections office to say you have a spoiled ballot, she said. Officials will instruct you on how to obtain a new one.Not sure about voting by mail? If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t anticipate being able to put in the effort to return your completed ballot correctly and on time, a better option might be to vote early in person \u00e2\u0080\u0094 masked and socially distanced, of course\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 provided you feel safe doing so and your state allows it, Shino said. This option can help you avoid potential Election Day crowds, she said. Vickery also encouraged people who feel safe voting early in person to do so, particularly because states that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have robust vote-by-mail programs prior to the pandemic may be struggling to adjust. Everyone has a different risk tolerance, and some people may absolutely feel more comfortable voting by mail due to underlying health issues or community transmission in their area \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but if you feel safe going to the grocery store, she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009chopefully you can feel safe going to vote early.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt eliminates so many of these challenges and the burden on our system, and it makes it safer for people to be sure that their vote counts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already received your mail ballot but decide you want to vote in person, most (but not all) states allow you to bring your mail ballot to your polling place, where officials will cancel it out and allow you to vote in person, Vickery said. This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t true of every state, so check the rules where you live. Failure to bring your mail ballot can lead to officials giving you a provisional ballot, which may not necessarily be counted, depending on your state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s process, she said."}]}
