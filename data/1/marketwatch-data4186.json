New York, New Jersey and Connecticut announced 14-day quarantines on Wednesday on visitors from states with high COVID-19 infection rates. The \u201ctravel advisory,\u201d which impacts residents of nine states, raises concerns about the pace of business activity resuming after lockdowns imposed to contain the spread of the pandemic. \u201cOnce you start talking about quarantines, there\u2019s a potential that it will lead to less travel,\u201d James Ragan, director of wealth management research at D.A. Davidson, in Seattle told MarketWatch, adding that markets had been rallying on the reopening story, underscored by improving consumer activity and daily airline travel. \u201cIf that starts to slow, that does create the narrative that the recovery could be on pause,\u201d Ragan said.

Hospitals in the state have been grappling with a more than doubling of patients hospitalized with coronavirus since the beginning of the month. \u201cWe have a coronavirus gut check in the market. The news we\u2019ve seen recently suggest the recovery is going to be uneven,\u201d said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist/SunTrust Advisory Services, in an interview. Lerner also thinks part of the selloff could be related to mutual funds and pension funds needing to rebalance their gains from equities to bonds before the end of the quarter.

The Trump administration also has been threatening to reimposing tariffs on imports of aluminum from Canada on July 1 as the new USMCA, or the United States Mexico Canada Agreement, which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement, is set to take effect.
