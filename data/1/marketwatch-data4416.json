Stocks rallied after testimony to Congress by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin underscored an ongoing commitment to anchor the U.S. economy through the global public health disaster. Recap: Mnuchin, Powell testify before House panel on coronavirus aid Mnuchin said the Treasury and Fed were looking at extending the Fed\u2019s established 11 emergency lending facilities to include asset-based lending markets, but also reiterated that additional types of COVID-19 aid likely will need to be addressed by Congress under the next phase of stimulus. Powell emphasized that the \u2018overriding goal\u2019 of the central bank\u2019s facilities is to help get the roughly 25 million workers who lost jobs during the pandemic back to work, while also warning that a second wave of COVID-19 infections could undermine consumer confidence again. \u201cWhile this bounce back in economic activity is welcome, it also presents new challenges\u2014notably, the need to keep the virus in check,\u201d Powell said. The hearing was required by the $2 trillion relief package Congress approved in March and came as the global tally for confirmed cases of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 rose to 10.3 million on Tuesday, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. Within the U.S., infections have climbed in 35 states over the past 14 days, according to a New York Times tracker, with California, Texas and Florida leading the way. \u201cThe government\u2019s inability to restrain public behavior, even through something as simple as ensuring mask compliance, is a dangerous threat to the economy of the U.S.,\u201d said Eric Schiffer, chief executive officer of private-equity firm Patriarch Organization, in Beverly Hills. \u201cIt ensures this cycle of viral pain continues longer than it should,\u201d he told MarketWatch. Both New Jersey and New York, states that have been seeing a smaller rise in new cases, have said that they may be forced to delay aspects of their business reopening plans as the virus spreads elsewhere. Earlier New York Fed President John Williams on Tuesday warned that the worst of the early days of the pandemic may be over, but noted that the economy remains damaged, at a virtual talk sponsored by the Institute of International Finance. Powell\u2019s promise on Tuesday to keep doing whatever it takes to support the U.S. economy until it gets back to where it was before the pandemic reverberated beyond the stock market. \u201cThose are pretty strong words and pretty strong actions,\u201d said David Norris, head of U.S. credit at TwentyFour Asset Management, in an interview with MarketWatch. \u201cWe know the road ahead is going top be filled with uncertainty, mostly driven by the trajectory of the virus, but we also know we have the support of the Fed.\u201d In a separate hearing Tuesday, public-health expert Dr. Anthony Fauci warned that the U.S. could see 100,00 new coronavirus infections a day in the U.S., unless everyone steps up their game. Speaking at the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee in Washington, D.C., Fauci said many states have reopened too quickly, and people are not abiding by rules of social distancing. In U.S. economic data, the Case-Shiller house price index rose 4% on an annual basis in April. The index of consumer confidence rose to 98.1 this month from a revised 85.9 in May, the Conference Board said Tuesday, though the level of confidence still remains well below pre-crisis levels.Which stocks were in focus?
