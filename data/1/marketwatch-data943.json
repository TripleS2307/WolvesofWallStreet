CNN and the Washington Post (where Woodward famously broke and reported on the Watergate scandal with fellow journalist Carl Bernstein) were given advance copies of the book, and published the eyebrow-raising accounts on Wednesday, which quickly went viral. Both news outlets obtained some copies of the audio tapes, which included the president admitting that he repeatedly played down the virus to keep the American people calm. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wanted to always play it down,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump told Woodward on March 19, days after he had declared COVID-19 a national emergency. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI still like playing it down, because I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to create a panic.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Indeed, he told a CNBC interviewer on Jan. 22 that he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worried about a pandemic. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, not at all. We have it totally under control. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be just fine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098To be honest with you, I wanted to always play it down. I still like playing it down, because I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to create a panic.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 President Trump, on March 19, 2020 In early February, he told reporters that by early April, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And during a Feb. 26, White House news conference, he said that, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be pretty soon at only five people [with COVID-19]. And we could be at just one or two people over the next short period of time. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had very good luck.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Meanwhile, Trump was also telling Woodward on Feb. 7 that the coronavirus was \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeadly stuff.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou just breathe the air, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s passed. And so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very tricky one. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very delicate one. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also more deadly than even your strenuous flu,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. And on March 19, Trump warned Woodward that the virus was infecting more people than just the vulnerable populations of elderly Americans and those with pre-existing conditions that health officials and the White House had originally warned about. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s turning out it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just old people, Bob.

He told reporters on March 17 that he \u00e2\u0080\u009cfelt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump responded during a press conference about possible Supreme Court picks on Wednesday. that \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe had to show calm\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the early days of the pandemic.
