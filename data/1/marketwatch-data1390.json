In Woodward\u2019s upcoming book on Trump, \u201cRage,\u201d the president is quoted saying the virus was highly contagious and \u201cdeadly stuff\u201d at a time he was publicly dismissing it as no worse than the flu. Woodward, the celebrated Washington Post journalist and best-selling author, spoke with Trump more than a dozen times for his book. \u201cHe tells me this, and I\u2019m thinking, \u2018Wow, that\u2019s interesting, but is it true?\u2019 Trump says things that don\u2019t check out, right?\u201d Woodward told the AP during a telephone interview. Using a famous phrase from the Watergate era, when Woodward\u2019s reporting for the Post helped lead to President Richard Nixon\u2019s resignation, Woodward said his mission was to determine, \u201cWhat did he know and when did he know it?\u201d See also: Trump himself asks why Woodward didn\u2019t immediately report the president\u2019s comments about playing down the coronavirus On Twitter TWTR, -0.23% and elsewhere online, commentators accused Woodward of valuing book sales over public health. \u201cNearly 200,000 Americans have died because neither Donald Trump nor Bob Woodward wanted to risk anything substantial to keep the country informed,\u201d wrote Esquire\u2019s Charles P. Pierce. The issue of daily journalists presenting newsworthy information in books isn\u2019t new. The competition for attention is intense, and headlines help boost sales and guest shots for interviews. Reporter Michael S. Schmidt of The New York Times recently attracted attention for his book, \u201cDonald Trump v. The United States,\u201d by reporting new details on an unannounced visit by Trump to Walter Reed military hospital in November 2019. Schmidt reported that Vice President Mike Pence was put on alert that he might have to briefly assume the powers of the presidency if the president had to undergo a procedure that required anesthesia. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Pence later said he didn\u2019t recall being put on standby for the Reed visit, which the White House has said was part of the president\u2019s routine annual physical. But Schmidt\u2019s book renewed speculation about Trump\u2019s health. Political figures with book deals also have been chastised for holding back timely material. Former national security adviser John Bolton, whose scathing memoir \u201cThe Room Where It Happened\u201d came out in June, declined discussing Trump\u2019s actions towards Ukraine while the impeachment hearings were being held earlier this year. Woodward\u2019s book, which comes out next week, draws from 18 conversations with Trump between December and July. During his AP interview, Woodward said Trump called him \u201cout of the blue\u201d in early February to \u201cunburden himself\u201d about the virus, which then had few cases in the U.S. But Woodward said that only in May was he satisfied that Trump\u2019s comments were based on reliable information and that by then the virus had spread nationwide. \u201cIf I had done the story at that time about what he knew in February, that\u2019s not telling us anything we didn\u2019t know,\u201d Woodward said. At that point, he said, the issue was no longer one of public health but of politics. His priority became getting the story out before the election in November. \u201cThat was the demarcation line for me,\u201d he said. \u201cHad I decided that my book was coming out on Christmas, the end of this year, that would have been unthinkable.\u201d Asked why he didn\u2019t share Trump\u2019s February remarks for a fellow Post reporter to pursue, Woodward said he had developed \u201csome pretty important sources\u201d on his own. \u201cCould I have brought others in? Could they have done things I couldn\u2019t do?\u201d he asked. \u201cI was on the trail, and I was (still) on the trail when it (the virus) exploded.\u201d"}]}
