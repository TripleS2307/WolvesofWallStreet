In U.S. economic data, April\u2019s S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price index rose 4.7% year-over-year in April. June\u2019s Chicago purchasing managers\u2019 index rebounded slightly to 36.6 in June, after falling to a 38-year low in May. Meanwhile, the Conference Board reported its index of consumer confidence rose to 98.1 this month from a revised 85.9 in May. In China, the official manufacturing PMI for June came in at 50.9, according to the country\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics. Readings above 50 signify an expansion in economic activity, while those below 50 signal contraction. This raft of strong data helped equities to shrug off concerns around the coronavirus, with major stock-market benchmarks booking their best quarter in around two decades on Tuesday. Investors are watching the rising number of coronavirus cases in at least with 35 U.S. states which are resulting in business activity slowing again. California Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered bars in several of the state\u2019s counties to close again, and Arizona\u2019s Gov. Doug Ducey said his state\u2019s bars, gyms, movie theaters and water parks would be shut down for at least 30 days Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organization, on Monday said \u201cthe worst is yet to come,\u201d regarding the state of the pandemic. His remarks came a day after COVID-19 reached two milestones: 10 million confirmed infections worldwide, and 500,000 deaths. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Tuesday \u201cwe do need to open up again, no doubt about it, we want to get the economy back, but you\u2019ve got to do it in a measured way, and now we\u2019re seeing the consequence of community spread, which is even more difficult to contain.\u201d Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spoke in front of the House\u2019s Committee on Financial Services. Powell warned the U.S. recovery would suffer a setback if the virus was not brought under control. New York Fed President John Williams said the U.S. economy was far from healthy even if worst of the coronavirus outbreak was over.What did market participants say? \u201cThe combination of better-than-expected consumer confidence and strong equity performance overshadowed any\u201d rebalancing flows, as investors were expected to pull their gains away from equities and plough them into government bonds, said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets. He also added portfolio managers may have rebalanced their portfolios well in advance of Tuesday, and, as a result, the bond market did not rally as it usually would at the end of the month and quarter."}]}
