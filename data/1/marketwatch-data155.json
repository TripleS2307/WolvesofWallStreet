The Caixin China services purchasing managers index rose to 54.8 in September from 54.0 in August, Caixin Media Co. and research firm Markit said Friday. It was the fifth straight month the index stayed above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction. The rate of expansion was also the sharpest in three months, Caixin said. The reading was supported mainly by continued solid demand in Chinese markets, while export orders contracted further last month, according to respondents surveyed by Caixin. \"The services sector's post-epidemic recovery showed signs of speeding up,\" said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, adding that service providers are positive about the economic recovery and outlook. A subindex measuring services companies' employment continued to rise and stay in the expansionary territory for the second month, as companies gradually expanded hiring amid recovering market demand. China's official nonmanufacturing purchasing managers index, a competing gauge, rose to 55.9 in September from 55.2 in August, the National Bureau of Statistics said earlier. The Caixin PMI is tilted more toward smaller companies, while the official one is weighted toward larger companies."}]}
