At 0730 GMT, shares traded 5.5% higher at 86.92 euros ($102.22). \"The continued very strong and successful execution of the Zalando platform strategy, against the backdrop of an accelerated consumer demand shift towards digital offerings in the course of the corona pandemic, has positively impacted the strong development in the third quarter,\" the company said late Thursday. In July, Zalando had increased its guidance following a strong second quarter. A number of analysts remarked on the company's good position at present, with Deutsche Bank calling Zalando \"very much in fashion.\" Analysts at Citi said the marketplace dynamic for the company is generally positive and although some of the better sales performance may reverse when the pandemic is over, they think increased penetration will remain. \"The group is well placed to emerge stronger from the Covid crisis with its pure online business and its transition towards a marketplace model,\" Bryan Garnier analyst Clement Genelot said, raising Zalando's target price to EUR95 from EUR89. The online fashion retailer now expects adjusted earnings before interest and taxes for 2020 in a range of EUR375 million to EUR425 million euros, up from EUR250 million-EUR300 million previously. The gross merchandise volume--a key indicator for sales growth--should grow between 25% and 27%, up from estimates of 20%-25%, while revenues should rise between 20% and 22% instead of 15%-20%. Zalando releases third-quarter results on Nov. 4. Write to Sarah Sloat at sarah.sloat@wsj.com"}]}
