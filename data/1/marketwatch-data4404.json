Improving data on employment and the manufacturing sector buttressed markets in the first trading day of the month even though about a dozen American states have paused or halted plans to allow more businesses to reopen. The Nasdaq COMP, +1.39% ended up 1% at around 10,155, finishing handily above its last record close on June 23 as gains in electric-vehicle maker Tesla Inc. TSLA, +1.89%, Netflix Inc. NFLX, +1.43% and Facebook Inc. FB, +0.26% helped to propel the technology-laden benchmark. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% finished up 0.5% at 3,116, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average BA, -0.39% closed down 0.3%, pressured lower by declines in components Boeing Co. BA, -0.39% and Exxon Mobil XOM, -1.47%. Early in the session, stocks got a boost from another Dow component Pfizer Inc. PFE, -0.27%, which reported positive results from its clinical trial for a COVID-19 vaccine candidate. An upbeat report on manufacturing activity from the Institute for Supply Management and a private-sector report from ADP also helped to stoke the buying mood on Wall Street, ahead of a highly anticipated nonfarm-payrolls report due on Thursday due to the July 4th holiday in the U.S."}]}
