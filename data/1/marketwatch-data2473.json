Data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University show 60,000 new cases were recorded on Tuesday, with Texas alone counting more than 10,000 new infections. At least 52 ICUs in Florida said they had reached capacity on Tuesday, according to the Washington Post. Another 17 hospitals said their regular beds were also full, the paper reported. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis told reporters at a briefing that the state had \u201cabundant capacity,\u201d and reiterated that many of the new cases are younger people who are less at risk of dying. As the U.S. case toll has continued to climb, the death rate has been falling, but Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, said that it\u2019s a \u201cfalse narrative\u201d to focus on that data point alone and cautioned Americans that there are \u201cmany other things that are very dangerous and bad about this virus.\u201d On a Facebook Live event, Fauci said the lower death rate is a reflection of an improvement in treatments, especially for patients with more severe forms of the disease, and the uptick in cases involving younger people. But young people can have horrifying symptoms and suffer long-term effects. A group of U.K. neurologists on Wednesday published details of more than 40 COVID-19 patients who suffered complications from the illness that included brain damage, including brain inflammation, delirium/psychosis and stroke. \u201cThe high incidence of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, particularly with hemorrhagic change, is striking,\u201d the neurologists wrote in a study published in the medical journal Brain. \u201cThis complication was not related to the severity of the respiratory COVID-19 disease.\u201d Other recovered COVID-19 patients have been left with symptoms including breathlessness, fatigue, numbness, a loss of taste and smell, memory problems and even paranoia. \u201cThe death rate is lower, I admit that, because people in general who are young are healthier,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean that you could not get seriously ill.\u201d The news that the U.S. has informed the World Health Organization of its decision to leave the agency next year drew widespread criticism, coming in the midst of the pandemic. Joe Biden, President Donald Trump\u2019s Democratic challenger in the November presidential race, said he would return the U.S. to the international body if elected. See now: Amid pandemic, U.S. officially withdraws from World Health Organization \u201cAmericans are safer when America is engaged in strengthening global health,\u201d Biden tweeted. \u201cOn my first day as President, I will rejoin the @WHO and restore our leadership on the world stage.\u201d Others lamented the move as certain to undermine the very entity tasked with leading vaccine development and drug trials to address the virus. \u201cTo call Trump\u2019s response to COVID chaotic and incoherent doesn\u2019t do it justice,\u201d said New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \u201cThis won\u2019t protect American lives or interests \u2014 it leaves Americans sick and America alone.\u201d Trump and Biden Take Different Approaches to Coronavirus Surge See now: Here\u2019s how the U.S. could save 45,000 people from dying of COVID-19 by NovemberLatest tallies There are now 11.9 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide and at least 545,728 people have died, according to the Johns Hopkins data.

It operates roughly 250 North America stores.

With stay-at-home orders in place, people were resorting to an even more casual style of dress, such as sweatpants and T-shirts.
