Here's why you shouldn't panic", "body": "A modest stock market correction could occur in the next few weeks but doesn't justify bearish targets or even a defensive investment strategy, JPMorgan strategists said. They said key coming data releases, such as payrolls on Friday and retail sales on Aug. 14 could \"undershoot expectations\" and drive the modest correction. \"Some misgivings are justified given a macro backdrop that is becoming muddied, but not muddied enough to justify bearish targets or a defensive investment strategy,\" say strategists, led by John Normand, in a note. Pent-up demand and the assumption that Congress will approve another stimulus package of at least $1 trillion means the economy remains \"well above trend,\" they say, while a larger correction was unlikely. Talks over another coronavirus stimulus package that would restore jobless benefits to millions of Americans continued into the weekend and will remain in focus this week. However, lawmakers reportedly remain far apart in the negotiations. \"A large correction (about 10%) would be tough to generate when positioning measures in equities are below average for most hedge funds,\" they add. August may be one of the most bearish months for risky markets, but JPMorgan says there were \"as many signs of calm as of concern,\" at the start of the month. The investment bank's U.S. strategists say they see an \"increasingly compelling case for value,\" as second-quarter earnings were likely to mark an inflection point in the profit cycle, and the global business cycle was \"surprising on the upside.\" The three major benchmark indexes have recovered from March lows, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56%  6.5% down year-to-date, the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87%  2% higher in 2020 and the Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39%  21.6% up for the year, hitting record highs on Monday."}]}
