I don't think this is going to slow down. ... I think that wherever there is wood to burn, this fire is going to burn, and right now we have a lot of susceptible people.' \u201d - Dr. Michael Osterholm, Center of Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota The wave language, said Osterholm, is drawn from the pattern of influenza outbreaks, in which an initial case load is traditionally followed by a lull and then a secondary and perhaps tertiary outbreak, whereas in this coronavirus pandemic the U.S. is still seeing daily case tallies trend upward in dozens of states on a regular basis, some 104 days after the World Health Organization formally made its pandemic call. \"I'm not sure the influenza analogy applies anymore,\" he said. \"I don't think we're going to see one, two and three waves - I think we're just going to see one very, very difficult forest fire of cases.\" Dr. Michael Osterholm leads the Center of Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.
