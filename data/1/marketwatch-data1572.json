I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think this is going to slow down. ... I think that wherever there is wood to burn, this fire is going to burn, and right now we have a lot of susceptible people.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Dr. Michael Osterholm, Center of Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota The wave language, said Osterholm, is drawn from the pattern of influenza outbreaks, in which an initial case load is traditionally followed by a lull and then a secondary and perhaps tertiary outbreak, whereas in this coronavirus pandemic the U.S. is still seeing daily case tallies trend upward in dozens of states on a regular basis, some 104 days after the World Health Organization formally made its pandemic call. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure the influenza analogy applies anymore,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to see one, two and three waves \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just going to see one very, very difficult forest fire of cases.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Michael Osterholm leads the Center of Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.
