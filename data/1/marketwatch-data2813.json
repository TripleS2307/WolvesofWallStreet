Here are a few things they have in common.", "body": "Ascena Retail Group Inc. is the latest retail company to join a growing list of those filing for bankruptcy during the COVID-19 pandemic. That list includes Brooks Brothers and J.Crew. Though the names may change, there are some factors that these companies have in common going into a chapter 11 filing. \u201cOf the retailer bankruptcy filings so far, the common denominators have been lack of e-commerce scale and capability, largely mall-based locations, narrow breadth of assortments (e.g. apparel-only, home-only), and, in seven of the 19 filings, private-equity owned enterprises that were overly burdened with debt,\u201d said Margaret Reid, senior portfolio manager at the private bank at Union Bank. Many of these factors pre-date the coronavirus pandemic which closed shops across the country. For example, the pandemic has accelerated the consumer shift to online shopping, which began even before the illness spread. And malls were struggling to attract foot traffic, especially as more retailers shuttered operations in the worst performing locations.

The retailers and brands that survive, and even excel through the pandemic crisis, are those that provide the convenience that customers want, and have the means to adjust and progress through the rapidly changing environment. \u201cThe overall trend of the US consumer willing to spend for value and convenience prior to COVID has only accelerated by the crisis, therefore those companies that have been positioned to deliver value and convenience \u2013 Target, Walmart, Costco \u2013 are likely to be gaining market share coming out of this as the economy reopens,\u201d said Reid. See: The back-to-school shopping season will be a \u2018dud\u2019 one analysts says, but the NRF is forecasting a record breaker Though Ascena US:ASNA still has notable names like Ann Taylor in its portfolio, it was also dragged down by a number of brands that had fallen out of favor with shoppers. \u201cWe have long held the view that although Ascena has a good track record of making various brand acquisitions work financially, its record on developing those brands has been far less impressive,\u201d wrote Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData Retail, in a note. \u201cThe results of this have already been seen with the closure of once popular staples like Dressbarn and the sale of a majority stake in Maurices.\u201d A significant number of the company\u2019s Justice stores will close and certain Ann Taylor, LOFT, Lane Bryant and Lou & Grey stores will cease operation, including all of the locations in Puerto Rico, Canada and Mexico. All of the company\u2019s plus-size Catherines stores will shutter. \u201cWithin the current portfolio there is exposure to weaker retail locations, so a pruning of the fleet makes sense from the perspective of getting rid of shops that are unlikely to deliver sales and profit growth,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cThis is especially so as more sales migrate online.\u201d Also:Brooks Brothers files for bankruptcy as its take on office gear falls out of step with more casual trends Ascena has $150 million in funding from existing lenders and expects that sum combined with cash flow generated by ongoing operations and cash on hand to be sufficient to meet its needs. \u201cThe company has some key strengths, among them the support of lenders and the ability to renegotiate commercial leases, but will have to close an enormous percentage of its stores and leave the international market aside, focusing entirely on domestic retail sales,\u201d said Jon Pasternak, bankruptcy partner at Davidoff Hutcher & Citron LLP. \u201cAscena will most likely emerge as a smaller, leaner, and meaner brand conglomerate that will look very different from the massive multinational corporation that existed until now.\u201d Surviving bankruptcy under tough coronavirus-affected conditions is only the beginning of Ascena\u2019s journey back to stable financial ground. Don\u2019t miss:These investors are sticking with retail despite the \u2018apocalypse\u2019 \u201cThe coronavirus pandemic exacerbated Ascena\u2019s persistent execution problems and challenges as a mid-priced player in the highly competitive apparel retail sector, adding to the growing list of retail bankruptcies in 2020,\u201d said Raya Sokolyanska, vice president at Moody\u2019s Investors Service. \u201cThe elimination of a significant portion of interest payments and the new financing will provide liquidity, but significant challenges remain as Ascena contends with both near-term disruption and long-term pressures in the space.\u201d Ascena stock plummeted 25.7% on Thursday following news of the bankruptcy filing. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF XRT, +0.05% has gained 0.5% for the year to date. The Amplify Online Retail ETF IBUY, +1.39% has rallied 48.3%. And the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% has edged down 0.5% Additional reporting by Ciara Linnane."}]}
