Perhaps the biggest mistake that many folks are making with face masks \u2014 besides not wearing them in public at all \u2014 is pulling the facial coverings down so that the nose is exposed. Amid the ongoing debate over when and where people should wear masks, and the mixed messaging behind that, what\u2019s perhaps been lost in the din is the correct way to put on a mask to actually help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the first place. The CDC guidelines call for wearing a mask that covers both your nose and your mouth, with the mask secured under your chin. It should fit snugly against your face. There should not be large openings or gaps around your nose, mouth and the sides of your face. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } But as summer temperatures have scorched the U.S. \u2014 and, let\u2019s face it, some social distancing fatigue has set in as the pandemic continues \u2014 health officials have had to remind people that pulling their masks down below their noses or their chins renders the mask basically useless. That\u2019s because you can still inhale the virus through your nose, or exhale viral particles and spread them to other people through your nose \u2014 even if you don\u2019t feel sick. In fact, a recent study from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill found that the SARS-CoV-2 \u2014 the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 \u2014 infects the cells in your nose much more easily than the cells in your throat or your lungs. Once the virus has established itself in your nose, it can then be aspirated into your lungs and cause more serious problems. What\u2019s more, the study suggests that people are probably releasing a higher concentration of the COVID-19 virus when breathing out of their noses, rather than exhaling out of their mouths. \u201cIf the nose is the dominant initial site from which lung infections are seeded, then the widespread use of masks to protect the nasal passages, as well as any therapeutic strategies that reduce virus in the nose, such as nasal irrigation or antiviral nasal sprays, could be beneficial,\u201d said study co-senior author Dr. Richard Boucher in a statement. Wearing masks \u201creally is a two-fer,\u201d he further explained to the News & Observer. \u201cYou\u2019re protecting yourself, and you\u2019re protecting somebody else from you transmitting something in an asymptomatic phase.\u201d But you have to wear the mask properly. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo recently took sloppy mask behavior to task while warning protesters and police alike to wear the coverings properly last month. \u201cThis is a mask,\u201d he said, pulling one up to cover his nose, mouth and chin. Then he pulled it down below his chin. \u201cThis is a chin guard,\u201d he said, noting that wearing a mask this way \u201caccomplishes nothing.\u201d \u201cNobody told you to wear a chin guard. Wear a mask,\u201d he said. More than 4 million Americans have tested positive for COVID-19, and 143,967 have died as of Friday morning. Dr. Anthony Fauci says, \u201cI certainly don\u2019t think we\u2019re near the end of this\u201d in a new interview with MarketWatch. President Donald Trump has at times also struck a more somber tone over the pandemic that has infected more than 15.3 million globally \u2014 and even begun calling on Americans to wear masks this week. \u201c \u201cNobody told you to wear a chin guard. Wear a mask.\u201d \u201d \u2014 Gov. Andrew Cuomo But individuals can make a major impact in the battle against this global crisis by taking three simple steps: washing their hands regularly, keeping their distance from other people \u2014 and wearing masks. That\u2019s according to a study out of the Netherlands that was published on Tuesday. \u201cA large epidemic can be prevented if the efficacy of these measures exceeds 50%,\u201d the researchers wrote. In other words, \u201cSARS-CoV-2 will not cause a large outbreak in a country where 90% of the population adopts handwashing and social distancing that are 25% efficacious (i.e., reduce susceptibility and contact rate by 25%, respectively).\u201d Indeed, at least 230,000 cases of the coronavirus may have been prevented due to government orders requiring face masks in 15 states and the District of Columbia between April and mid-May, according to a recent study by two University of Iowa professors. Another study suggests that nearly 45,000 U.S. deaths from coronavirus could be prevented by November if 95% of the population wore masks.

There are also many myths and misconceptions surrounding masks, such as that people only need to wear one if they\u2019re showing symptoms, or that wearing a mask will reduce your oxygen level. Neither of these is true.

An observational study published in the medical journal Thorax on Thursday found that a two-layer facial covering reduced the number of droplets spreading from coughing and sneezing better than a single layer of fabric. A three-ply surgical mask was the most effective. Still, even one layer is better than nothing.

You should also store them in a paper bag or re-sealable plastic bag to prevent them from becoming contaminated, rather than tossing them on your dresser or in your car.
