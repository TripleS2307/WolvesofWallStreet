I see little reason to delay giving when so much good can be achieved through supporting worthwhile causes today. Besides, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot more fun to give while you live than to give while you are dead.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the attitude of Chuck Feeney, the one-time billionaire who has spent several decades doing his best to give away his fortune. Just as he was wildly successful as the co-founder of retail giant Duty Free Shoppers, he was also accomplished in meeting his charitable goal. This week, Feeney closed his 38-year-old Atlantic Philanthropies, having donated all his cash to such lofty endeavors as bringing peace to Northern Ireland and modernizing Vietnam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health care system. More recently, he spent $350 million to turn New York city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Roosevelt Island into a technology hub, Forbes reported. His donations include a total of $3.7 billion to education and another $870 million to fight for human rights and social change, like $62 million toward abolishing the death penalty in the United States and $76 million to back the passage of Obamacare. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe learned a lot. We would do some things differently, but I am very satisfied. I feel very good about completing this on my watch,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Feeney, now 89, told\u00c2 Forbes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy thanks to all who joined us on this journey. And to those wondering about Giving While Living: Try it, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll like it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Feeney years ago said he would set aside about $2 million to fund his and his wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s retirement. Dubbed the \u00e2\u0080\u009cJames Bond of Philanthropy\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Forbes, Feeney now lives in a small apartment in San Francisco that \u00e2\u0080\u009d has the austerity of a freshman dorm room. \u00e2\u0080\u009c Hear more from the man himself: div.youtube { height:0; position:relative; padding-bottom:56.25%; } div.youtube > iframe { position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; } While he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t trumpet all his accomplishments along the way, Feeney was still incredibly influential, with both Berkshire Hathaway\u00e2\u0080\u0099s BRK.A, +0.06% Warren Buffett and Microsoft MSFT, +2.48% co-founder Bill Gates cheering his work. \u00e2\u0080\u009cChuck\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been the model for us all,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Buffett told Forbes when asked for comment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you have the right heroes in life, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re 90% of the way home. Chuck Feeney is a good hero to have.\u00e2\u0080\u009d At the closing of Atlantic Philanthropies, which was done over Zoom, Gates and former California Gov. Jerry Brown both sent video messages praising Feeney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work. Also, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi sent an official letter from the U.S. Congress thanking him. Feeney was definitely feeling the love: iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not here to tell anyone what to do with their money,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Feeney once said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou make your money, you do what you want with it. But I think there is an obligation, certainly for the haves, to reach out and to see what they can do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}]}
