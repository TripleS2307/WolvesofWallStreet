The short-term home rental service, which had been hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic and the abrupt halt of travel, has seen a rebound in rental bookings as people take getaways closer to home, if at all. If the 12-year-old company does go public, it would enter a welcoming IPO market that has seen big offerings from the likes of insurance startup Lemonade Inc. LMND, +12.82% and music label Warner Music Group Inc. WMG, +0.54% amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The Journal -- which stressed that Airbnb's timeline for a public offering could change -- noted that the San Francisco-based company was recently valued at $18 billion, down from as high as $31 billion some three years ago. Morgan Stanley MS, -0.34% will lead the offering, and Goldman Sachs GS, -0.21% will also be involved, the Journal said."}]}
