About \u00e2\u0082\u00ac40 billion of the plan's funding will come from the new European Union joint recovery fund, the government said. - The plan is based on tax cuts and incentives for businesses (\u00e2\u0082\u00ac30 billion), a massive public investment in the green transition and areas such as transport, clean energies and construction (\u00e2\u0082\u00ac35 billion), and \"social cohesion\" measures (\u00e2\u0082\u00ac35 billion) such as support for part-time work programs, training for young workers and health care.

It is designed to try to \"avoid an economic collapse,\" French Prime Minister Jean Castex said on Thursday. - The French stock market PX1, +0.71%  rose 2% in early trading Thursday after the plan was detailed, twice as fast as the average of European indexes measured by the Stoxx 600 SXXP, +0.55%. - According to the French government, the plan will help the economy make up for the coronavirus-related loss of GDP by the end of 2022, and help create 160,000 new jobs next year. According to the French central bank, the economy could shed up to 1 million jobs by the end of 2020.

According to government estimates, the country's GDP will shrink by more than 10% this year. Opinion:France throws \u00e2\u0082\u00ac15 billion at aerospace sector. It better be money well spent The outlook: With French public debt expected to reach 120% of GDP this year, French President Emmanuel Macron hopes that his plan, by boosting growth, will help stabilize the burden at that level until 2025. He also hopes it will stabilize his rating, and put him in a better position to run for a new term when the campaign for the April 2022 presidential election starts in earnest at the end of 2021. That can only happen if he manages to prove that his policies can create jobs. The substance of the plan is in line with Macron's bid to focus on structural reforms.
