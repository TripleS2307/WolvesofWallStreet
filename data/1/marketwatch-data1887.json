Besides things like personal protective equipment, signage and social distancing, all of which the city says will be in place by Sept. 10, the union is calling for every single student, educator and staff member to have a positive antibody test result or receive a diagnostic test at least 10 days before a school opens for classes. \u201cNo New York City school should open unless it meets all the criteria that we will present for you here today,\u201d Mulgrew said. \u201cWhat happened in March cannot happen again in this city.\u201d Inevitably, classes would have to be delayed from their Sept. 10 start date in order to meet the union\u2019s demands, Mulgrew acknowledged. But rather than a uniform first day, he proposed a gradual reopening as individual schools became ready. That would mean a delay of several weeks, until late September or early October, for schools if stakeholders, including City Hall and the Department of Education, worked quickly, he said. The union\u2019s ultimatum comes amid growing calls for New York City to delay the start of in-person classes. Don\u2019t miss: The new coronavirus is mutating, but that \u2018may be a good thing,\u2019 says top expert Last week, the leader of a union representing the city\u2019s principals sent a letter to Mayor Bill de Blasio and schools Chancellor Richard Carranza, urging more time to train teachers and to make necessary building updates. A union representing nearly 23,000 lunch workers and crossing guards sent a similar letter last week, asking for a delay to the school year. But the teachers union has been working closely with Mayor Bill de Blasio and the Department of Education to come up with the city\u2019s current school plan, and throughout negotiations had not asked for required testing for teachers and students. See: Is it safe yet to work and go back to school in New York? \u201cThis is fear mongering,\u201d said Miranda Barbot, spokeswoman for the city\u2019s Department of Education, in a statement. \u201cWe spend hours a day, literally, talking to the UFT about policies and procedures and have delivered on a robust and practical testing protocol, a nurse in every building and a 30-day supply of PPE for every school.\u201d Ms. Barbot called the city\u2019s back-to-school plan the most rigorous in the country. \u201cIt seems like they just don\u2019t want to say the quiet part out loud: They don\u2019t want to open schools at all for students and families.\u201d Mulgrew said he presented the union\u2019s additional criteria to the mayor last week, and now he\u2019s waiting to hear back. De Blasio has said there\u2019s enough time to get everything ready in time for the September start date. But among the biggest challenges Mulgrew raised is adequate testing. A safe reopening would require monthly screening of all teachers and random student testing each month, with higher rates of testing in neighborhoods with known outbreaks, said Mark P. Jarrett, deputy chief medical officer at Northwell Health who advised the union\u2019s report. Also on MarketWatch: Why the COVID-19 \u2018baby bust\u2019 could impact stock prices for the next 30 years Mulgrew also raised concerns about contact tracing, which he said would need to be carried out school-wide within 24-hours of a positive test result. A union-led team of around 100 inspectors were also going around to every school to check on the status of ventilation system upgrades and other building preparations, he added. New York City is the only major school district in the country attempting any form of in-person learning this fall. Districts from Los Angeles to Chicago will start the school year completely remote. Under the current hybrid-learning plan, students will return to classrooms a couple days a week and learn remotely on the other weekdays, while mandatory mask-wearing, social distancing and cohorting students to limit exposure will take place in school buildings.

Dukes, president of the NAACP in New York, and Randi Weingarten, president of national teachers union the American Federation of Teachers, threw their support behind opening New York City schools this fall. \u201cNo one is looking to throw up obstacles,\u201d said Johnson at the union\u2019s news briefing. On the contrary, he said, he wants New York City to \u201cbe the model.\u201d"}]}
