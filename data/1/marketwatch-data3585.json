Initially, good earnings from the likes of FedEx provided some support, as did talk of coronavirus vaccine distribution plans by the White House, and upbeat sentiment about the latest batch of IPOs, including the cloud software company, Snowflake.

The Nasdaq finished up 133.67 points, or 1.2%, at 11,190.32, logging back-to-back gains.What drove the market? Stocks gave up earlier gains to close mostly lower Wednesday, after the Fed indicated it will keep rates near zero through at least 2023, but also warned of risks to the economy without additional fiscal stimulus during the coronavirus pandemic. The Dow initially climbed 300 points in afternoon trade, after the Fed\u2019s rate-setting committee indicated that future rate hikes will hinge on at least two things: labor market conditions return to the \u201cmaximum employment\u201d and inflation has risen to 2% and \u201cis on track to moderately exceed 2% for some time. But those gains faded after Fed Chair Powell reiterated that the economic downturn resulting from the pandemic is \u201cthe most severe in our lifetime,\u201d in an afternoon news briefing. To that end, the central bank expects to keep up its \u201cfull range\u201d of support up for some time, including its current $120 billion monthly pace of assets purchases in the form of government Treasurys and mortgage bonds until the economy is \u201cfar along in its recovery.\u201d Kathy Jones, Charles Schwab\u2019s chief fixed-income strategist, said it boils down to the Fed confirming, once again, that it\u2019s committed to doing all it can to support the economy, but that it wants to see Congress do more to blunt the pandemic\u2019s carnage. \u201cI\u2019ve never in my career heard so many Fed officials basically pleading for fiscal policy,\u201d Jones told MarketWatch. \u201cI think every time it comes up, and we realize it\u2019s not happening yet, it weighs on the risk assets.\u201d Further, the Fed\u2019s outline for a future where interest rates likely stay at zero for at least the next three years \u201cis not a positive signal for the economy,\u201d Jones said. Powell said the economy likely risks ongoing unemployment stress, as well as an uptick in evictions and foreclosures, \u201cthings that will scar the economy,\u201d without additional fiscal support from Congress, during his briefing. It was the first policy statement and updated economic forecasts under the Fed\u2019s new flexible inflation target strategy announced last month. Here\u2019s a recap: Fed decision day Investors have come to expect a prolonged period of support from the Fed, which has helped bolster the U.S. stock market since its lows during the coronavirus crisis in March, but many also have been waiting on Congress to pass a spending package.

Sales topped pre-crisis levels during the month, but the rate of growth is slowing. \u201cThe consumer has performed well so far given the health and economic impact from Covid, but there is still a long way to go in the recovery story,\u201d said James Knightley, ING\u2019s chief international economist, in written commentary, underscoring obstacles such as high unemployment, slim chances of \u201cmeaningful fiscal stimulus in the next few months\u201d and the \u201cclear threat that a fractious election\u201d that endanger consumer sentiment and spending.

The Paris-based organization said it now expects the world economy to shrink 4.5% this year, less than its June prediction for a 6% decline, reflecting a slowly improving U.S. labor market and China data.
