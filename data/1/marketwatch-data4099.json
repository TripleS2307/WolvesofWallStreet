Now see:Joe Biden to give speech of a lifetime as he accepts Democratic presidential nomination. Trump\u2019s visit to Pennsylvania capped a week of visits to four battleground states, in which he is polling behind the Democratic nominee. Surveys of swing-state voters as well as betting markets have Trump behind Biden in the race for the White House. Trump\u2019s strategy is to blast Biden as beholden to the far left of the Democratic Party, and in his speech he noted Pennsylvania is a fracking state and charged Biden would use tax increases to fund the \u201cGreen New Deal.\u201d Biden has not fully embraced that plan to fight climate change and says he\u2019d ban fracking for oil and gas production only on federal lands. Biden\u2019s acceptance speech on Thursday night will conclude the Democrats\u2019 four-day convention, which this year was almost entirely virtual due to coronavirus health concerns. Republicans will renominate Trump next week in much the same format. Trump plans to speak Aug. 27 from the White House.
