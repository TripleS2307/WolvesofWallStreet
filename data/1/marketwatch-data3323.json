Using cell-phone data on which stores millions of people visited, economists Austan Goolsebee and Chad Syverson of the University of Chicago found that traffic began to decline sharply before government restrictions were put in place, especially in counties with the most severe viral outbreaks. Read:U.S. likely regained 3 million jobs in June, but coronavirus flareups hamper recovery From March to May, Americans also shifted to smaller, less busy stores from larger ones that typically draw bigger crowds. \u201cBy many accounts, anxious individuals engaged in physical distancing on their own accord,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cWhile overall consumer traffic fell by 60 percentage points, legal restrictions explain only 7 of that. Individual choices were far more important and seem tied to fears of infection.\u201d The recent rash of new coronavirus cases in states such as Texas, Florida and Arizona appear to support the paper\u2019s conclusions. Foot traffic and social mobility began to decline in those states even before they moved to reimpose new restrictions or delay further reopening of their economies. If the pattern holds, many Americans are unlikely to venture out much until the pandemic recedes again or treatments are developed. That could delay or slow an economic recovery and consign some companies in hard-hit industries such as retail, travel and dining out to failure \u2014 regardless of how much states reopen. \u201cRepealing lockdowns may not a particularly powerful tool for restarting growth. If people are otherwise concerned about potential infection, lifting legal restrictions on their activity has limited effect,\u201d Goolsbee and Syverson wrote. Goolsbee was a former top adviser to President Barack Obama. The paper was put out by the National Bureau of Economic Research."}]}
