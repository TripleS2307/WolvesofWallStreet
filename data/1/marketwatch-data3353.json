Based on the front-month contracts, prices saw a weekly climb of 1.5%, which represents their fourth weekly rise in a row according to Dow Jones Market Data. October Brent crude UK:BRNV20, the global benchmark, lost 4 cents, or 0.09%, at $45.05 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe, ahead of the contract\u2019s expiration at Monday\u2019s settlement. For the week, front-month contract prices climbed by 1.6%. Hurricane Laura was responsible for at least six deaths and caused extensive damage as it came ashore and moved inland Thursday. However, production from oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico and activity at refiners in the Gulf Coast, the heart of the U.S. oil-processing industry, was expected to rebound quickly. The five Texas oil refineries that were shut ahead of Hurricane Laura are planning to restart soon, but two major refineries near Lake Charles, La. May take longer due to power outages and \u201cpotentially more serious storm damage,\u201d according to an article Friday from S&P Global Platts. The storm surge was less than anticipated, lowering the probability of prolonged downtime, said Jason Gammel, analyst at Jefferies, in a note. Still, largely all the refining capacity in Lake Charles, Louisiana, and nearby Port Arthur, Texas, was offline in anticipation of the storm, he noted, which along with some reductions and closures in the Houston area likely affected around 3.4 million barrels a day of distillation capacity. \u201dIn normal times this might have led to a sustainable surge in refining margins, but we expect the gains this week will be fleeting given the ample unutilized capacity elsewhere and high product inventories,\u201d Gammel said. Around half of U.S. petroleum refining capacity is located outside of the region. Analysts said crack spreads\u2014the difference in price between a barrel of crude and the products refined from it\u2014remain at unattractive levels, which could weigh on demand for oil. The gasoline crack spread settled at $7.95 on Thursday, the weakest settlement since April 13, said Robert Yawger, director of energy at Mizuho Securities, while the heating oil crack ended at $8.657, the lowest since June 4. \u201cRefiners generally do not make money when the cracks are trading at levels below $10\u2026Refiners may be reluctant to quickly return to production when the product they make is a money losing proposition,\u201d he said, in a note. Data from the Interior Department\u2019s Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement on Friday estimated that 84.3% of current oil production in the Gulf of Mexico was shut in, with shut ins of 60.1% for natural-gas production\u2014both unchanged from Thursday. Also Friday, Baker Hughes BKR, -1.34% reported a decline of 3 in this week\u2019s number of active U.S. oil rigs. Last week, it was up by 11 rigs, following three weeks of declines. On Friday, front-month September gasoline US:RBU20 rose 2.4% at $1.3155 a gallon, with prices up nearly 2.5% for the week, while September heating oil US:HOU20 added nearly 0.5% at $1.2162 a gallon\u2014up 0.7% for the week. The September contracts expire at Monday\u2019s settlement. On its first full session as a front-month contract, October natural gas US:NGV20 fell 2% to $2.657 per million British thermal units. For the week, the contract was up 3.3%, but prices rose 8.5% from last Friday\u2019s finish for the September contract, which was the front month."}]}
