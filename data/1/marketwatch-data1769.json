MarketWatch photo illustration/ Getty Images|iStockphoto As a few battleground states look on track to decide the 2020 White House race, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth looking at how their economies are faring during the coronavirus recession. Do any key swing states suffer from a relatively high unemployment rate, potentially making them easier game for Democratic challenger Joe Biden as he battles President Donald Trump? Pennsylvania, with its 20 electoral votes, appears to fit the bill. The Keystone State had 10.3% unemployment last month, topping the national rate of 8.4%. The table below shows how six key swing states have been faring in terms of August unemployment, as well as two other metrics based on data from earlier in the summer \u00e2\u0080\u0094 renters behind on payments to their landlords and usage of food stamps, also known as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. Further down, another table shows how Biden is generally leading Trump in polls focused on those six states, which are viewed by analysts as likely to determine the presidential election\u00e2\u0080\u0099s outcome. The former vice president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advantage in Pennsylvania is 4.0 percentage points vs. his average edge of 3.8 points in the battleground states. Trump and his campaign have said pollsters are\u00c2 getting the 2020 race wrong. Unemployment rate in August % of renters behind on rent % rise in food-stamp recipients Florida 7.4% 21% 42% Pennsylvania 10.3% 18% 10% Michigan 8.7% 20% 14% North Carolina 6.5% 27% 15% Arizona 5.9% 17% 13% Wisconsin 6.2% 12% 15% Average for the 6 swing states 7.5% 19% 18% U.S. average 8.4% 21% 19% Sources: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities The two additional metrics (renters behind on rent and food-stamp usage) come from an analysis of government data by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think thank. North Carolina has shown an especially high percentage of cash-strapped renters, based on Census Bureau figures from July, while Florida had a particularly large increase in food-stamp usage from February to June, according USDA data.

He needs to have that be a wash, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not close to a wash right now. Trump is getting credit for those first three good years of his term with the economy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The former vice president \u00e2\u0080\u009cneeds to get out and campaign more, fundamentally, and then he needs to campaign about the economy more while he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sabato added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just talk about the pandemic, even though it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your No. 1 issue. Work the economy in, too.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Related: Biden says U.S. economy was \u00e2\u0080\u0098more equitable\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in Obama era And read: Trump can beat Biden, analyst says \u00e2\u0080\u0094 watch for \u00e2\u0080\u0098a big Q3 GDP figure\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Betting markets\u00c2 are giving Biden a 54% chance of winning vs. the Republican incumbent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 45%. Another closely watched measure of viability is each campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s finances, and Biden had more cash on hand as this month began. Trump also often touts the performance of the stock market. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% has been selling off this month, but the equity gauge is still positive for the year and notched an all-time high on Sept. 2.
