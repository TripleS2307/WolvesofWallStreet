Andrew Cuomo on Monday criticized President Donald Trump's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, calling out his comments about COVID-19 testing on the Fourth of July and his decision not to wear a mask. Trump on Saturday tweeted, \"if we didn't test so much and so successfully, we would have very few cases.\" \"He is facilitating the virus, he is enabling the virus, by statements like that,\" Cuomo said during a news conference. \"You're seeing the infection rate go up, and the economy suffer.\" New York was once the epicenter of the coronavirus epidemic in the U.S., and the most recent daily figures show the state now has 817 hospitalizations, 518 new cases, and nine deaths, with Cuomo noting that cases have continued to decline since the state began its reopening process on May 15. However, in the rest of the U.S., at least 38 states are reporting increasing infections rates."}]}
