Still, Home Depot stock edged down 1.1% in Tuesday trading. For the year to date, shares have jumped 30.5% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% is down 2.7% for the period. Home Depot executives are unsure of the remainder of the year, even if the first part of 2020 was a blockbuster. \u201c[W]e\u2019re cautious to extrapolate trends from the first half of the year into a forecast for the remainder of the year, particularly given the tremendous amount of uncertainty we face with regards to the duration and continued impacts of the virus,\u201d said Home Depot Chief Executive Craig Menear, according to FactSet. UBS thinks smaller projects were a contributing factor as well. \u201cCustomers likely performed a number of smaller projects, driving up traffic,\u201d wrote analysts led by Michael Lasser. \u201cHome Depot\u2019s ticket was up 10.1% probably supported by customer trip consolidation, big-ticket strength, and some lumber inflation.\u201d UBS rates Home Depot stock buy with a $300 price target.

Sales that used the company\u2019s online platforms were up about double for the quarter, and more than 60% picked up their orders in a store. Placer.ai data shows that Home Depot visits were up 19.1% year-over-year in June and 19.0% in July. On August 1 and August 2, the increase was 34.3% and 38.2% respectively. Visits at Lowe\u2019s Cos. LOW, +1.38% were up as well, rising 30.9% in June and 25.8% in July. Lowe\u2019s reports second-quarter earnings on Wednesday. \u201cThis indicates that the demand could be longer-term creating a powerful opportunity for both brands,\u201d Ethan Chernofsky, vice president of marketing wrote in a Placer blog post last week. \u201cThe idea here is that greater levels of focus on the home alongside economic concerns that reduce the desire to buy new create a scenario where upgrades become the most desirable way forward.\u201d The end of government economic stimulus benefits could impact future home spending. Don\u2019t miss:Amazon Prime Day, back-to-school uncertainty is changing the shopping calendar \u201cThe ending of enhanced benefits is undoubtedly a negative as it will deprive many households of the extra cash they were spending on the home,\u201d said Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData Retail. \u201cHowever, from our data it is still clear that home remains a big priority for most consumers and spending cuts are more likely to be focused on categories such as apparel. It is also true that by spending less on things like travel, gasoline, and eating out, some households can devote more cash to their homes.\u201d This bodes well for Home Depot. Wells Fargo is even more upbeat, especially considering that more people are moving out of cities and will have projects in their new homes. \u201cWe view sustainability of strong Q2 trends the largest needle-mover for shares going forward, and considering recent improvement in leading housing metrics (turnover, etc.), de-urbanization, an extended stay-at-home lifestyle and lingering government stimulus benefits, we see ample levers supporting continued upside into 2H20,\u201d analysts led by Zachary Fadem wrote. Wells Fargo rates Home Depot stock overweight with a $300 price target."}]}
