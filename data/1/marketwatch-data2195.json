Pompeo, speaking in Philadelphia, singled out property rights and religious freedom as \u201cforemost\u201d principals in a speech that elsewhere complained about the \u201cproliferation\u201d of protections in international agreements related to human rights. \u201cWe are forced to grapple with tough choices about which rights to promote and how to think about this,\u201d he said. \u201cAmericans have not only unalienable rights, but also positive rights granted by governments, courts and multilateral bodies. Many are worth defending in light of our founding; others aren\u2019t.\u201d Pompeo on Thursday released a report produced by the Commission on Unalienable Rights, which he tasked last year with conducting a broad review of U.S. human rights policy, arguing at the time that it had \u201clost its bearings.\u201d Before its release, many human rights groups were skeptical of the commission, whose chairwoman was conservative legal scholar Mary Ann Glendon, a former U.S. ambassador to the Holy See. Pompeo noted that the report emphasizes property rights and religious liberty. \u201cNo one can enjoy the pursuit of happiness if you cannot own the fruits of your own labor. And no society can retain its legitimacy or a virtuous character without religious freedom,\u201d he said. The report did not produce any specific recommendations and steered clear of endorsing policy proposals. But experts who parsed it for direction noted, for example, that it referred to abortion and same-sex marriage not as rights but \u201cdivisive social and political controversies.\u201d Critics such as Sen. Bob Menendez, the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the report would damage the United States\u2019 reputation as a champion of human rights around the world by narrowing the scope of who deserves protection. \u201cAs feared, Secretary Pompeo used his speech to insinuate a hierarchy of rights where property rights and religious liberty are \u2018foremost\u2019 rights and some rights are not \u2018worth defending,\u2019\u2019\u2019 said the New Jersey Democrat. Critics also faulted the makeup of the commission, saying it was weighted with conservatives, and the public did not have sufficient opportunity to weigh in on its findings before the report\u2019s release. \u201cAs was clear from the start, Secretary Pompeo\u2019s Commission on Unalienable Rights was designed to challenge the international consensus with a narrow view of human rights, that among other things would leave LGBTQ people even more vulnerable to violence and discrimination,\u201d said David Stacy, government affairs director of Human Rights Campaign. Pompeo also took aim in his speech at demonstrators \u201cpulling down statues\u201d and \u201cdesecrating monuments,\u201d in echoes of President Donald Trump\u2019s recent speech at Mount Rushmore. The secretary of state said it was an attack on the people who fought for the rights laid out in the Declaration of Independence. He also criticized The New York Times for its 1619 Project, an award-winning explanation of the persistent legacy of slavery in the United States. \u201cAmerica is fundamentally good and has much to offer the world because our founders recognized the existence of God-given unalienable rights and designed a durable system to protect them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut these days I must say even saying America is fundamentally good has become controversial.\u201d"}]}
