Robyn Beck/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images BEIJING \u2014 While Wednesday night\u2019s vice-presidential debate was universally called \u201ccivil\u201d \u2014 with many saying the most riveting moment was when a fly perched on Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s head \u2014 China emerged as the source of several of the evening\u2019s more heated exchanges. China has been a dominant theme in the campaign for months, with the presidential candidates releasing ads or declarations avowing their hardline stance against the rising economic rival.

Kamala Harris said halfway into the debate, \u201cthe vice president earlier referred to what he thinks of as an accomplishment \u2014 the president\u2019s trade war with China. You lost that trade war,\u201d she said, staring at Pence. \u201cYou lost it.\u201d \u201cLost the trade war with China?\u201d Pence responded moments later. \u201cJoe Biden never fought it. Biden\u2019s been a cheerleader for Communist China over the last several decades.\u201d Moderator Susan Page of USA Today later brought up China as an entire segment of the debate, asking Pence, \u201cHow would you describe our fundamental relationship with China? Competitors? Adversaries? Enemies?\u201d As Page was posing her question, the CNN feed of the debate inside China was cut off \u2014 as often happens when foreign channels delve into topics that Chinese leaders deem sensitive. This left viewers here in the dark about Pence\u2019s response. Curiously, however, the feed resumed when it was Harris\u2019s turn to respond. It\u2019s unknown why. The country\u2019s vast team of censors closely monitor all forms of media that citizens might see, so it was unlikely an accident. Harris has made stern comments regarding China in the past, and raised the ire of state media after she accepted her nomination, and is not seen as a China dove. \u201cU.S. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden\u2019s choice of Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate, who Donald Trump dubbed as the \u2018meanest\u2019 U.S. senator, is expected to add points to Biden\u2019s campaign as Harris is a female African American, but her harsh stance on China will likely escalate the \u2018who-is-the-toughest-on-China competition\u2019 between the \u2018donkey and elephant\u2019 in the 2020 U.S. presidential race,\u201d state-run Global Times wrote just after her nomination, citing \u201cChinese observers.\u201d Chinese social media barely registered the debate. More popular U.S.-related topics included a hashtag claiming President Trump had promised free medical care for those with coronavirus, based on a statement the president made Wednesday. Capitol Report: Trump calls contracting coronavirus \u2018blessing from God\u2019 in latest video, claims Regeneron antibody \u2018cocktail\u2019 could be made available to all, for free Another heated exchange came when Harris was asked about the U.S.- China relationship. \u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s perspective and approach to China has resulted in the loss of American lives, American jobs and America\u2019s standing,\u201d Harris said as Pence shook his head. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about standing,\u201d Harris continued. \u201cPew, a reputable research firm, has done an analysis that shows that leaders of all of our formerly allied countries have now decided that they hold in greater esteem and respect Xi Jinping, the head of the Chinese Communist Party, than they do Donald Trump, the president of the United States. This is where we are today, because of a failure of leadership by this administration.\u201d The Pew survey, published Tuesday, found abysmal approval ratings for both Trump and Xi, but indeed found that Western Europeans favored the Chinese leader 19% versus 17% for Trump.

MarketWatch struggled to find anyone at a busy shopping complex in central Beijing who could name either vice-presidential candidate. One respondent, who gave his name as Kevin and said he reads U.S.-related news on WeChat, said, \u201cAll I know is one of them is a woman.\u201d Tanner Brown covers China for MarketWatch and Barron\u2019s."}]}
