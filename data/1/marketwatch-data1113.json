Americans should brace themselves for another round of coronavirus in the fall, health professionals and economists say. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development released its twice-a-year economic outlook on Wednesday, and presented two scenarios \u2014 one where the coronavirus continues to recede, and another where a second wave of rapid contagion erupts later in 2020. It said a second wave of SARS-CoV-2 is as likely as not. OECD Chief Economist Laurence Boone said both forecasts are equally probable. \u201c \u2018We can only look at what other seasonal coronaviruses and seasonal influenzas do. Based on that, most of us feel comfortable there will be a second wave.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Gregory Poland, who studies the immunogenetics of vaccine response in adults and children at the Mayo Clinic Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for three decades and one of the leading experts on the pandemic in the U.S., said on Tuesday, \u201cIn a period of four months, it has devastated the whole world. And it isn\u2019t over yet.\u201d He added, \u201cWhere is it going to end? We\u2019re still at the beginning of it.\u201d Yet last week, he said, \u201cWe don\u2019t inevitably have to have a second wave.\u201d Fauci has previously said that a vaccine could take 12 to 18 months and that would be a game changer. Some observers say even that timeline is wildly optimistic. Many epidemiologists advise more caution when talking about the reduced prospect of a second wave. Gregory Poland, who studies the immunogenetics of vaccine response in adults and children at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and who is an expert with the Infectious Diseases Society of America, told MarketWatch, \u201cNobody has a crystal ball. We\u2019d all like to know definitively. We can only look at what other seasonal coronaviruses and seasonal influenzas do. Based on that, most of us feel comfortable that there will be a second wave.\u201d While COVID-19\u2019s progress has slowed in major cities such as New York, where most cases in the U.S. are centered, confirmed coronavirus cases have risen in more than a dozen U.S. states, with some of the most populace states a key cause of concern: Texas, California and Florida. During the great influenza pandemic of 1918, the second wave was worse than the first, partly due to a more virulent strain of the virus. Another complication: Flu and SARS-CoV-2 have almost identical symptoms: fever, coughing, night sweats, aching, tiredness, and nausea and diarrhea in severe cases. Like all viruses, neither are treatable with antibiotics. They can both be spread through respiratory droplets via coughing and sneezing, yet hail from different virus families. There is still no universal flu vaccine, even though scientists have been researching the flu since the 1940s. Poland likens our desire to get back to normal life to the fable of the tortoise and the hare, and advocates clear, consistent messaging. \u201cThe race doesn\u2019t always belong to the swiftest. The public and political pressure is for a vaccine as soon as possible. Public pressure is not data. Moderna hasn\u2019t produced data from their Phase 1 vaccine trial. We\u2019re going to have to be very careful here. We have individual countries, individual mayors, governors, senators, the House and the president all inferring their own recommendations. What the public hears is just static.\u201d \u201c \u2018In a period of four months, it has devastated the whole world. And it isn\u2019t over yet ... Where is it going to end? We\u2019re still at the beginning of it.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for the last three decades Approximately 10% to 20% at the very most of the U.S. population will be immune to the new coronavirus next time around, Poland said. \u201cThat means 70% to 80% of us are immunologically naive. People think because we hit Memorial Day and we have nice weather that it\u2019s over. It ain\u2019t over. When coronavirus hit earlier this year, 99% of the seasonal influenza was over. This won\u2019t happen next time, and they have similar symptoms. We still don\u2019t have testing solved. Health-care providers are exhausted. They still don\u2019t have enough personal protective equipment.\u201d Similar to Poland, Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization\u2019s Health Emergencies Program and former epidemiologist specializing in infectious disease and public health, in May warned of complacency surrounding relaxation of social distancing measures. Countries should \u201ccontinue to put in place the public-health and social measures, the surveillance measures, the testing measures and a comprehensive strategy to ensure that we continue on a downwards trajectory, and we don\u2019t have an immediate second peak,\u201d he said. Flattening the curve of new cases through social distancing, testing and contact tracing will help to avoid overwhelming the health-care system during any possible second wave, health professionals say. The U.S. has about 2.8 hospital beds per 1,000 people, according to industry website STAT News, which reports on public health and science issues. \u201cWith a population of 330 million, this is about 1 million hospital beds. At any given time, about 68% of them are occupied. That leaves about 300,000 beds available nationwide,\u201d the publication said. Letter from New York:\u2018When I hear an ambulance, I wonder if there\u2019s a coronavirus patient inside. Are there more 911 calls, or do I notice every distant siren?\u2019 Many epidemiologists advise more caution when talking about the reduced prospect of a second wave. MarketWatch photo illustration/Getty Images Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recently told the Financial Times that he \u201ccan\u2019t guarantee\u201d that there won\u2019t be more stay-at-home requirements in the winter or the fall. \u201cWe are committed to using the time that we have now to get this nation as over-prepared as possible. We\u2019ve seen evidence that the concerns it would move to the southern hemisphere like flu [are coming true],\u201d Redfield told the U.K. paper, adding, \u201cWhen the southern hemisphere is over I suspect it will re-ground itself in the north.\u201d \u201c \u2018Can you travel from the southern hemisphere to the northern hemisphere this summer? Of course you can. That will spark a second wave.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Gregory Poland, who studies the immunogenetics of vaccine response in adults and children at the Mayo Clinic How are we going to prepare for a possible second wave? \u201cHuman behavior is controlling the pandemic\u2019s parameters,\u201d Poland added. \u201cIn a lot of the southern hemisphere, there is not the same public-health infrastructure, medical infrastructure and not the same access to PPE. There are also a host of other cultural factors that are different. Can you travel from the southern hemisphere to the northern hemisphere this summer? Of course you can. That will spark a second wave.\u201d That, he adds, doesn\u2019t account for further transmission during the recent riots across the U.S. Mutation is another unknown. \u201cThis is an RNA virus and inherently a virus that will mutate and undergo recombination. When people are co-infected with two or more strains, the virus has the opportunity to trade genetic material. Patients in neighboring hospital beds might have subtly different coronaviruses. Now you provide the petri dish for them to combine. We hear things like \u201coperation warp speed.\u201d Never before have I seen politics, public opinion/public pressure and economics weigh so heavily on the science to subvert and pervert it.\u201d \u201cIf we\u2019re not expecting a second wave or a mutation of this virus, then we have learned nothing,\u201d New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. \u201cThat is why it is such an important period for government.\u201d Poland paints a grim worst-case scenario for this: \u201cImagine this scenario: It\u2019s October. The influenza epidemic occurs, COVID-19 comes back. We\u2019re fussing with China. There\u2019s been a glitch with Moderna trials. There\u2019s another police killing, and now the riots are inflamed because nothing appears to be fixed, and we\u2019re in the middle of a political campaign. This does not have good optics to me.\u201d \u201cIf I were king for a day, brother, this would be run differently,\u201d Poland said. \u201cI would take a Consumer Reports/Good Housekeeping approach. I\u2019d get the best experts assembled, something like the National Academies of Science, and this would be the kitchen cabinet who would recommend what kind of studies we need to do now to get the best kind of data to inform best practices. I would not waste any of my time sniping politically at anybody else. I would be a wartime king. I would fund all of the nudges to encourage good behavior, and have radical transparent honesty with the public.\u201d \u201c After worrying exponential growth in the early days of the pandemic, other countries moved quickly to flatten the curve of new cases. \u201d The Dow Jones Industrial Index DJIA, +0.56% and the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% were higher Wednesday, as investors weighed progress in COVID-19 vaccine research amid fears of rising cases of coronavirus in U.S. states that have loosened restrictions. The COVID-19 pandemic, which was first identified in Wuhan, China in December, had infected 10,501,482 people globally and 2,636,538 in the U.S. as of Wednesday. It had claimed at least 512,071 lives worldwide, 127,427 of which were in the U.S., according to Johns Hopkins University. The Dow Jones Industrial Index DJIA, +0.56% and the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% were slightly higher Wednesday, despite the surge in coronavirus cases in some of the most populous states in the U.S., including California, Florida and Texas. For his part, Fauci credited an improvement in testing and contact tracing as a way to help avoid a second wave of coronavirus. \u201cIt\u2019s the way we and the efficiency and effectiveness in which we put the manpower, the systems, the tests, to identify isolate and contact trace that will determine how successful we are in preventing that wave,\u201d Fauci told CNBC\u2019s \u201cHalftime Report.\u201d The U.S. health-care system will also have an opportunity to stock up on ventilators and PPE and, in an ideal world, people will understand the benefits of social distancing. That same strategy of testing and tracing people who have tested positive so they can be quarantined appears to have worked in other countries, most notably Iceland. After worrying exponential growth in the early days of the pandemic, Iceland\u2019s government has flattened the curve of new cases. Only six new cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, were detected in May. There have been only three new cases so far this month, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 1,807 and the total number of deaths from COVID-19 to 10. In a few short months, scientists around the world have learned a lot about SARS-CoV-2, including the virus\u2019s genetic structure; how it infects human cells; what kind of disease manifestation it causes; and how it impacts the liver, kidney and brain, and how secondary symptoms affect children. That progress has been reflected in the Dow Jones Industrial Index and S&P 500, which recovered most of the ground lost earlier in the pandemic. Equity indexes have ricocheted in recent months as markets remained nervous of progress on vaccine research. Poland cautions against read into public debate or the markets as an indicator of what the virus will do next. \u201cThe coronavirus only knows one thing,\u201d he says, \u201cand that is to infect another host.\u201d"}]}
