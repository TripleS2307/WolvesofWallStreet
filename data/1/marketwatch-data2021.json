Your financial adviser has a plan", "body": "After decades of working, your professional identity is seared into you. It largely shapes how you see yourself. As you near retirement, an underlying concern lurks just below the surface: What happens when my career ends? Where will I keep a sense of purpose? \u201cThe fear is entirely rational,\u201d said Thomas Hlohinec, a Philadelphia-based financial adviser. \u201cLook at a workaholic. With their work, they\u2019re well respected. But they may be unhappy at home.\u201d Executives can measure their success with yardsticks such as annual bonuses, impressive job titles and lavish perks. But at home, things are different. You might brag about your kids or possessions, but it\u2019s not the same as gaining instant status from the soaring arc of a respected career. Advisers who help pre-retirees transition into a new phase know that the loss of professional prestige can sting. Even if their clients don\u2019t necessarily love their chosen line of work, it gives them a daily structure and drive to excel. To proactively address his clients\u2019 fears of losing their purpose after retiring, Hlohinec asks them two questions: 1. In the last five years, what aspects of your job did you not enjoy? 2. In the last five years, what did you work on that you really enjoyed? Their answers tell him a lot about how to design a retirement that capitalizes on what someone enjoys and minimizes what they don\u2019t. If a client likes to coach new hires, for instance, Hlohinec might connect him with local entrepreneurship programs that seek volunteer mentors. \u201cIt\u2019s shifting their focus from the fear and uncertainty of what\u2019s ahead to getting them excited to do more of what they enjoyed,\u201d Hlohinec said. When clients open up about their anxiety, attentive advisers welcome these personal conversations. They acknowledge the fear and offer a roadmap to address it. Ryan Sullivan uses a four-step approach to guide clients through their fears. A managing director at Hartford Funds in Wayne, Pa., Sullivan urges advisers to apply this repeatable process whenever a client confides in them: 1. Empathize: Before racing to offer solutions, attend to clients\u2019 emotional state and see the situation through their eyes. 2. Offer perspective: Normalize the fear by assuring clients that they\u2019re not alone. (\u201cMany of my clients feel that way as they approach retirement.\u201d) 3. Give options. Propose a menu of strategies for clients to consider. Explore a range of possibilities, from basic steps (\u201cSample a few new hobbies\u201d) to more ambitious ones (\u201cRun for city council\u201d). 4. Agree on the next steps: Confirm what the client and adviser will do to implement potential solutions \u2014 and set a follow-up appointment. \u201cIn the last step, you\u2019re setting up mileposts so that the client thinks about getting to the next meeting,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cHaving a definite date for the next interaction alleviates a fear of the unknown\u201d and holds everyone accountable for following through. Advisers also can help by recommending outside resources, such as referring the pre-retiree to a therapist. For Kyle Moore, a certified financial planner in St. Paul, Minn., a simple gift works wonders: Moore gives out copies of \u201cHow to Retire Happy, Wild, and Free\u201d by Ernie Zelinsky. For example, when a client in her late 60s, a university professor, expressed concern about retiring, Moore gave her the book. After reading it, she decided to pursue personal writing projects and serve on nonprofit boards as she segues into retirement over the next few years. \u201cShe went from being nervous about retirement to being more excited about it,\u201d Moore said. \u201cShe still doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s on the other end, but now she has lots more ideas. The book helps you reflect on what skills you\u2019ve acquired over your working years and how you can use those gifts and talents to be fulfilled in retirement.\u201d More: Are you overlooking this critical factor in deciding what is the \u2018best place\u2019 to retire?
