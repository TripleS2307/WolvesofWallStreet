He was a key enforcer of \"Abenomics,\" the economic policy based on long-term monetary easing, fiscal stimulus and structural reforms. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 He's set to formally become prime minister after a vote of Japan's parliament, the Diet, on Wednesday. But he is only serving Abe's remaining year as LDP leader, and will face a new leadership election in September 2021. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Japanese political analysts expect Suga to call for a general election before the end of the year, to give him the popular mandate that will help him push through further economic reforms. Opinion: Olympics postponement will make just a dent in Japan's GDP. It could have been worse, if the games had gone ahead The outlook: Suga's lack of international and diplomatic experience may prove a hindrance, most notably when elaborating Japan's policy toward increasingly assertive China, or dealing with President Donald Trump's frequent tirades against countries that export a lot to the U.S., and the Trump era's uncertain commitment to the defense of U.S. allies. But the new prime minister's main task in the short term is to pull the country's economy from the depths of its current recession. Japan, already plagued by slow growth before the coronavirus, has been hit by a steep fall in both consumer demand and exports, as world trade slowed on the pandemic impact.
