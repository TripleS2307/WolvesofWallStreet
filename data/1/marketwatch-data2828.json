He was a key enforcer of \u00e2\u0080\u009cAbenomics,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the economic policy based on long-term monetary easing, fiscal stimulus and structural reforms. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s set to formally become prime minister after a vote of Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parliament, the Diet, on Wednesday. But he is only serving Abe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remaining year as LDP leader, and will face a new leadership election in September 2021. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Japanese political analysts expect Suga to call for a general election before the end of the year, to give him the popular mandate that will help him push through further economic reforms. Opinion: Olympics postponement will make just a dent in Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s GDP. It could have been worse, if the games had gone ahead The outlook: Suga\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lack of international and diplomatic experience may prove a hindrance, most notably when elaborating Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policy toward increasingly assertive China, or dealing with President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s frequent tirades against countries that export a lot to the U.S., and the Trump era\u00e2\u0080\u0099s uncertain commitment to the defense of U.S. allies. But the new prime minister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main task in the short term is to pull the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy from the depths of its current recession. Japan, already plagued by slow growth before the coronavirus, has been hit by a steep fall in both consumer demand and exports, as world trade slowed on the pandemic impact.
