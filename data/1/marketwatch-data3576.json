But it is the slaughterhouse that people talk about. The complex on the edge of the small town of Rheda-Wiedenbr\u00c3\u00bcck is Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest meat plant, with a workforce of 6,500. Locals discuss the busses shuttling Romanian and Polish workers to the 25,000 pig-per-day facility run by the T\u00c3\u00b6nnies Group, and the apartment blocks where workers sleep six to a bedroom. Recently, gossip has also turned to the plant floor, where thousands of eastern-Europeans are lined shoulder-to-shoulder along noisy conveyor belts. By late June, approximately a fifth of the staff had tested positive for coronavirus. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEveryone knew [about conditions there] before. It was a constant topic of conversation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ursula Mense-Petermann, a university professor living 13 miles from the plant. Now, she says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe whole of German society\u00e2\u0080\u009d is aware of the plant. The outbreak led to a quarantining of workers, provoked broader shelter-in-place restrictions in the region, and burst gossip about labor practices at the T\u00c3\u00b6nnies plant into a national fascination. Germans asked: How could their modern egalitarian country \u00e2\u0080\u0094 of all places \u00e2\u0080\u0094 be host to such shocking conditions? That question has ricocheted across wealthy, Western countries, where coronavirus outbreaks at factories and food production facilities have pulled back the curtain on labor practices more often associated with the developing world. A thread running through food industries in Germany, the U.K., and the U.S. shows companies have sometimes navigated regulations to put in place something like industrial enclaves, often employing foreign workers under standards and practices associated with less wealthy nations. When COVID hit, these conditions seem to have left some of the facilities especially vulnerable to a disease that spread rapidly. They often employ low-paid workers in cramped conditions, frequently toiling for long hours in proximity to one another. The employees, desperate for work, are often unable to seek improvements to their working environments or to take adequate time off for sickness. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing it all over the world with these types of jobs. It starts with the workers: they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a very vulnerable workforce,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Kim Cordova, leader of the union local representing workers at the JBS USA meatpacking plant in Greeley, Colorado, site of one of America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deadliest workplace outbreaks. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey build the plants that are in very political conservative communities, where the workers don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have support with chambers of commerce, or county commissioners.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Exclusive:Health official quits after being pushed to reopen Colorado county and hot-spot meat plant In Germany, the meat processing industry has developed enclaves of low-cost Eastern European workers. In 2004, when Poland and Hungary joined the European Union, their citizens couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be directly employed in Germany. But German businesses could hire Eastern European companies. So German meatpackers set up separate conveyor belts for different stages of meat processing that could be staffed with teams from a specific \u00e2\u0080\u0098service provider,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 each with ties to Eastern European labor recruiters, said Mense-Petermann, who recently published a study on labor in the German meat industry. At first these crews were paid and managed under their home countries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 labor laws, earning three to five euros per hour, a fraction of German wages. Eventually, reforms meant all workers were paid a German minimum wage, and conveyor gangs had to register as German companies. But abuses persisted, Mense-Petermann said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a system of organized lack of responsibility,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. Teams have been paid by the amount of meat they produced in a given amount of time in giant, chilled-temperature factories tightly packed with workers, pig carcasses and shouting foremen, she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne reason for the devastating working conditions, in my view, is that subcontractors do not own any plant, any machinery, any facilities. They just employ workers. Labor costs is the only screw they can turn to make profit themselves,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ursula Mense-Peterman added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe broader public has not been aware of the fact that, in the midst of the German society, there were such labor practices.\u00e2\u0080\u009d More than 1,500 workers tested positive at the G\u00c3\u00bctersloh plant at the end of June, leading the government to put more than 500,000 people into self quarantine, according to German news reports. The outbreak was shocking, given that Chancellor Angela Merkel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s government had been praised internationally for containment efforts. News reports said some workers returned to their home countries after the outbreak, while others were resistant to the idea of sitting in quarantine without pay. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m angry with the company, T\u00c3\u00b6nnies. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m angry with the system behind it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d G\u00c3\u00bctersloh Mayor Henning Schulz told public broadcaster Deutsche Welle. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m angry with the system of sub-sub-subcontractors which is totally intransparent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Merkel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s administration has proposed legislation making slaughterhouses offer jobs directly to workers, with her agriculture minister describing meat industry labor subcontracting an \u00e2\u0080\u009cuntenable practice\u00e2\u0080\u009d involving \u00e2\u0080\u009ccascades of shadow companies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In July, T\u00c3\u00b6nnies responded to criticism by announcing an \u00e2\u0080\u009caction plan for extended pandemic prevention\u00e2\u0080\u009d where it would directly employ about one-sixth of its workers, help with housing for some of the newly-hired workers, as well as provide masks, testing and social distancing. The company didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t respond to a request for comment. Read:Tyson sued by families of 3 Iowa workers who died from coronavirus In 2004, workers in Morecambe Bay in the northwest of England dredged up 21 bodies of Chinese cockle pickers who had been trapped by riding tides in their workshed and drowned. The criminal case that followed became a national whodunit, with detectives turning up a web of labor contractors called \u00e2\u0080\u0098gangmasters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 profiting off illegal Chinese immigrants. The story became a national fixation, focusing on the idea of \u00e2\u0080\u009cmodern slavery.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Critics of U.K. labor regulation say focus on this term hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been helpful for combating the broader issues related to the exploitation of foreign workers in the food industries. Labor contractors still provide much of the labor in the food sector, and there remain plenty of abuses that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t rise to the level of \u00e2\u0080\u0098slavery,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 critics say. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey look at the cases that are most spectacular, with a focus on bigger cases that are more sensationalist and linked to organized crime,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Johanna Katharina Schenner, a labor and employment research scholar at the University of California at Berkeley. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut not all labor law violations are linked to organized crime.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The 2019-2020 end of year performance report of the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority identifies 15,186 potential victims of labor exploitation or licensing breaches. But it only reports eight enforcement case convictions for the period. Darryl Dixon, the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s director of strategy, says that his colleagues do focus on day-to-day exploitation, and that these numbers don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t account for other ways to handle violations, such as referring cases to other agencies, or pressing employers to improve conditions. The U.K. has a relatively small number of work safety inspectors compared with Europe, said Schenner. The food business system of depending on contractors, of chartered flights of eastern Europeans flying in to pick a crop, and the reticence among workers of reporting violations, makes it difficult to enforce developed world standards in U.K. food factories and farms. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have overcrowded housing; people living in trailers, five together. They can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford to rent in the U.K.,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Schenner said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd then you have labor intensification. When you work at a higher speed you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be as careful about the virus\u00e2\u0080\u0099 spread.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Food processing plants, along with elder-care facilities, prisons and schools, have been key sites of coronavirus outbreaks in the U.K., according to a study by researchers at Imperial College London and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. In June, meat plants in West Yorkshire and Anglesey closed temporarily after 208 workers tested positive for coronavirus. And in July, seasonal pickers on a bean-and-broccoli farm in Herefordshire had to isolate after 73 tested positive for the infection. An English worker on the farm described isolated, communal living quarters with mostly Bulgarian and Romanian workers, living and working \u00e2\u0080\u009cso close together that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not surprising that if anyone gets COVID,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to a Guardian report. An aerial photograph of the farm shows 18 trailer houses parked 20 feet apart from each other in a field alongside warehouses. Health authorities said 200 workers had been quarantined in trailers and that the government would provide them translators and other services. Unite, the U.K. labor union, denounced what it said were cramped, unsafe working conditions in British agriculture generally, and a frequent failure to comply with requirements for distancing, protective wear and safety checks. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe said at the start of this pandemic that this is something that is likely to happen, and in particular on the farms because workers are put in caravans or dormitories where they have to share,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bev Clarkson, Unite\u00e2\u0080\u0099s national officer for agriculture, said in a statement.

The JBS USA plant is an enclave in other ways, too, something the public discovered when plant workers, many of them immigrants, began dying of coronavirus this spring. Until the 1980s, meatpacking was one of America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s highest paying blue-collar jobs. But then labor unions lost a series of strikes resulting in pay cuts. New plants opened as nonunion operations, hiring undocumented workers until a series of crackdowns drove companies to seek other laborers for the grisly, injury-prone, exhausting type of jobs few American citizens wanted. Factory owners turned to refugee relocation programs run by the U.S. State Department, and by charitable organizations. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese were jobs that were \u00e2\u0080\u0094 compared to jobs in Somalia, Myanmar, and Bhutan \u00e2\u0080\u0094 high paying,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said David Michaels, who lead America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top workplace regulator, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration between 2009 and 2017. But that agency \u00e2\u0080\u009chas been weakened,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, and \u00e2\u0080\u009cright now is doing very little to protect meat workers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d With the coronavirus pandemic, protecting workers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 health fell to a Balkanized system of independent county regulation. Colorado alone has 53 local health agencies, ultimately overseen by elected county commissioners with their own ideas about the best ways to regulate business. Pushing the JBS plant in Greeley to comply with measures to fight the pandemic fell to top county health official Mark Wallace, who stepped down in May, after county commissioners ordered him to work toward \u00e2\u0080\u009copening\u00e2\u0080\u009d county businesses against his own better judgment, as reported by MarketWatch. Since then, eight more county medical officers have stepped down in Colorado, said Theresa Anselmo, executive director of the Colorado Association of Local Health Officials. They were joined by officials quitting in at least 23 other states, according to a review by Kaiser Health news Service and the Associated Press, which counted 49 health officers quitting nationwide as of August 10. In Colorado \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey continue to be threatened personally, their property is vandalized. They are being put under pressure to agree with measures that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t science or public-health based just for the expediency to open. Their orders are being defied openly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Anselmo. Six plant workers and one manager have died of coronavirus, with at least 300 infected at the Greeley beef plant, according to state reports. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported July 10 that in April and May, 86 meatpacking workers nationwide had died of coronavirus. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWestern countries rely on immigrants from poorer countries to do the hard low-paying jobs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Michaels, now a professor at George Washington University School of Public Health. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut these workers are often unprotected, have little ability to protect themselves, and the governments are often unwilling or unable to step in and protect them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cordova said that testing for coronavirus at the JBS plant remains incomplete. Workers aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t given adequate filtration masks, and line-speeds have been quickened, meaning workers aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t able to take care to stay separate from each other, increasing risk of infection, she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is still not enough testing available,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd there is still work-while-sick culture.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In a statement responding to MarketWatch questions, JBS USA said the plant doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a work-while-sick culture, workers showing coronavirus symptoms are tested, and that the plant provides safety measures that include handing out thousands of masks each day. \u00e2\u0080\u009cContinued claims that the plant is not safe or is not providing adequate protective equipment are inconsistent with the views of numerous health professionals\u00e2\u0080\u009d visiting the plant, said the statement.
