Under the new in-principle agreements, U.S. drug developer Novavax NVAX, +0.18% will provide 60 million doses of its coronavirus vaccine to the U.K. Janssen Pharmaceutica, a division of Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +1.39% will supply the U.K. with 30 million doses of its candidate. With today\u2019s announcement, the U.K. has now secured access to six different candidates, across four different vaccine type, taking its potential stockpile to 340 million doses \u2014 one of the biggest in the world. That is enough for five doses per person. \u201cThe government\u2019s strategy to build a portfolio of promising vaccine candidates will ensure we have the best chance possible of finding one that works, U.K. business secretary Alok Sharma said in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s agreements will not only benefit people in the U.K. but will ensure fair and equitable access of a vaccine around the world, potentially protecting hundreds of millions of lives.\u201d he added. If the vaccines are safe and successful in clinical trials, both could be delivered to the U.K. in mid-2021, the government said.

On Friday, Novavax said it would deliver 60 million doses of its coronavirus vaccine to the U.K. as early as the first quarter of 2021. As part of the agreement, the U.K. will fund a late-stage trial of Novavax\u2019s NVAX, +0.18% vaccine candidate to assess the efficacy of the vaccine on the country\u2019s population. The trial, which is scheduled to start in the third quarter of 2020, will be a study in about 9,000 adults between 18 years and 85 years of age to protect against symptomatic COVID-19 disease as well as evaluate antibody and T-cell responses, Novavax said in a statement. Read:Novavax says its COVID-19 vaccine shows promising results in early study Kate Bingham, chair of the U.K. government\u2019s Vaccines Taskforce, said it is encouraging that Novavax\u2019s recent clinical data shows their vaccine triggers an immune response greater than that in patients who have recovered from the disease. \u201cWe believe that Novavax has a highly innovative vaccine that could be the first in its class of protein-based vaccine options. We are happy to partner with them and global organizations such as CEPI [Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations] to further our mutual commitments to ensure global access to the vaccine,\u201d she said. Separately, Johnson & Johnson said its Belgian subsidiary Janssen will supply the U.K. government with its candidate known as Ad26.COV2-S with an initial sale of 30 million doses on a not-for-profit basis for emergency pandemic use. The U.K. has an option to buy an additional 22 million doses. Ministers have also agreed in principle to co-fund a global clinical study of the Janssen vaccine. The next phase of clinical trials is expected to begin later this year to look at whether providing two doses of their vaccine candidate to participants provides long-term protection against coronavirus.

The same month, GlaxoSmithKline GSK, +1.52% said it had taken a stake in German vaccines maker CureVac. The U.K. government had previously announced a deal with AstraZeneca for the drugmaker to produce 100 million doses of its potential vaccine being developed in partnership with the University of Oxford. Novavax said it would join with Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies to manufacture the antigen component of its coronavirus vaccine candidate, NVX-CoV2373, from its Billingham, Stockton-on-Tees site in the U.K., to produce as many as 180 million doses of the vaccine annually."}]}
