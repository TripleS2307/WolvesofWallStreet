The test is of particular interest given that there are wait times of days or sometimes weeks to receive a COVID-19 test result. Abbott said the test must be performed by a health care professional in a point-of-care setting; however, people who receive the test can download a new free mobile app that will provide a verifiable test result that includes the date the test was performed. Abbott said the display of results is similar to a digital boarding pass used by airlines. \"Just as interest in COVID-19 testing seemed to be waning, Abbott once again answers, the bell\" Raymond James' Jayson Bedford told investors on Thursday. \"The timing of this [emergency use authorization] is a positive surprise, as is the price, accuracy, and capacity.\" The diagnostics maker has developed and launched six COVID-19 diagnostic and antibody tests during the pandemic. Its stock is up 18.8% year-to-date, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% has gained 7.6%."}]}
