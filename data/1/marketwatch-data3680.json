According to James Quincey, chief executive of Coca-Cola KO, +0.69% \u00c2 , many of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 400 \u00e2\u0080\u009cmaster brands\u00e2\u0080\u009d are in just one country, accounting for just 2% of total revenue. At the beginning of the pandemic, Quincey said the company decided to \u00e2\u0080\u009cruthlessly prioritize\u00e2\u0080\u009d core brands, which would also aid the supply chain.

Coca-Cola said that it would stop operations on the Odwalla brand of juice beverages, effective July 31. There will be 300 job cuts as a result of the move. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis gives us the flexibility to support our investments in brands like Minute Maid and Simply and to continue to scale rising start like Topo Chico,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Quincey said. Topo Chico is a brand of sparkling mineral water. Bottled water has been a hot item, with Nielsen data showing online sales of seltzer, tonic and club soda climbing 61% year-over-year for the week ending June 13. Quincey said that Coca-Cola turned its attention to the sparkling category in China and saw a 14% increase in volume for the quarter, with strength in Coke Zero Sugar.

Shares have tumbled nearly 13% for the year to date. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% \u00c2 is down 6.7% for 2020 so far. Coca-Cola suffered from a decline in sales at places like stadiums, arenas, and movie theaters, which were shuttered due to COVID-19. However, Fairlife milk and the Simply juice brands did well as more consumers stayed home. Ryan Giannotto, director of research at GraniteShares, which offers the U.S. Large Cap XOUT, +1.15% \u00c2 among their products, says the company has failed to generate wealth for shareholders during the quarter due to a lack of technological advancement.

Coca-Cola talked up its touchless beverage fountains, which were introduced last week and allow customers to fill their drinks from their phones without creating an account or downloading an app. The company plans to roll out these Coca-Cola Freestyle fountains across the U.S. by the end of the year."}]}
