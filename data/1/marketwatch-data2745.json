Domino\u00e2\u0080\u0099s DPZ, -2.50% \u00c2 previously had wings on the menu, but, according to Richard Allison, the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief executive who spoke about the new item on the Thursday earnings call, they were in need of improvement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn our view, the upgraded product quality coupled with the investment behind advertising to support the rollout could allow the brand to take share in this multibillion-dollar category,\u00e2\u0080\u009d wrote BTIG analysts led by Peter Saleh.
