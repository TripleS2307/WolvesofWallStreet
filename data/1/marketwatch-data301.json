The FTSE 100 sports-betting and gambling group--which owns the Coral, Eurobet, Ladbrokes and CasinoClub brands--expects 2020 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization between 770 million pounds and 790 million pounds ($994.8 million-$1.02 billion), up from the previous guidance of GBP720 million-GBP750 million. Net gaming revenue from the online business soared 26% in the three months to Sept. 30, driving a double-digit increase in overall sales. U.K. retail was down 5% and European retail edged up 2%. GVC said its U.S. joint venture BetMGM continues to make good progress and it is expected to deliver full-year revenue between $150 million and $160 million. The share of the full-year loss from the joint venture for GVC is forecast to be around GBP60 million, it said. The London-listed company also announced an agreement to acquire Bet.pt, a Portuguese gambling operator. GVC expects the Portuguese sports-betting and gaming market to more than double by 2023 to 450 million euros ($529.5 million).
