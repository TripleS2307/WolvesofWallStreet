Yet the big question is this: Can the rebound in consumer spending \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the driving force of the U.S. economy \u00e2\u0080\u0094 carry on once all the pentup demand that built up during the lockdown is met and government aid to families and unemployed workers fades away? Read:Retail sales surge a record 17.7% in May, but coronavirus wounds still visible The partial recovery in sales in May was helped not just by states beginning to reopen their economies. The federal government also provided up to $1,200 in onetime stimulus to families and made unemployment benefits more generous for the millions of people who lost their jobs. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe economy is recovering, but when you start at historic lows and you reopen, that should not surprise anyone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe issue over the next two or three months will not be how big a gain we get, but how close we get to the end of 2019 levels.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Getting back to retail-sales numbers at the end of 2019 is likely to be a huge challenge. Even after the spike in May, receipts are still 8% below precrisis levels. Washington is preparing further relief measures, but it has no plans to send out another round of $1,200 checks. The Trump White House and Republican-controlled Senate also favor a reduction in emergency unemployment benefits that in many cases pay workers more to stay home than to return to work. Extended jobless benefits run out at the end of July.

Restaurants, airlines, hotels, sports leagues, entertainment venues and certain segments of the retail industry are sure to struggle to get back to normal with so many customers hesitant to gather in large groups. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSectors most affected by ongoing social distancing requirements will take longer to recover,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said senior U.S. economist Andrew Hunter at Capital Economics. Although the official unemployment rate fell in May to 13.3% from a record 14.7%, some 20 million Americans were still out of work at the end of the month. A large chunk of them could be sidelined for much longer and that will weigh on consumer spending in the months ahead. \u00e2\u0080\u009dMillions of households are caught in the high unemployment rate trap and they will not be feeling as optimistic any time soon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Robert Dye, chief economist at Comerica Bank in Dallas. A further complication could be a recent increase in COVID-19 cases in some U.S. states probably resulting more people returning to work as well as the mass protests over police brutality. If the increases in COVID-19 infections occur as economies reopen, then some states may pull back in allowing people to have greater access to shops, restaurants, etc,\u00e2\u0080\u009d wrote David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAdditionally, consumers may be more reticent about potential exposure."}]}
