FLWS, +3.90% surged 10.4% in premarket trading Thursday, after the flowers seller raised its full-year fiscal 2020 outlook for profit, revenue and free cash flow, as consumer demand started accelerating in late March amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The company now expects adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal year ending in June to grow 75% to 85% from a year ago, compared with previous guidance of a rise 15% to 17%. The FactSet EPS consensus of 62 cents implies 19% growth. The revenue growth guidance was increased to 16% to 18% from 8% to 9%, and the estimate of free cash flow is now $75 million to $85 million, up from $45 million to $50 million.
