The California Consumer Protection Act, or CCPA, is considered the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first true data-privacy law and among the strongest aimed at the digital economy. Consumer advocates say it could usher in more state laws that hold the likes of Facebook Inc. FB, +0.26% \u00c2 and Alphabet Inc.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s GOOGL, +1.82% \u00c2 GOOG, +1.97% \u00c2 Google more accountable for how they monetize the data of billions of people world-wide. The CCPA officially became California law on Jan. 1, and began being enforced by California Attorney General Xavier Becerra on July 1 after a six-month grace period. When asked about it near the end of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s earnings conference call last month, Chief Financial Officer David Wehner launched into a long discourse about its impact on advertising, the lifeblood of Facebook. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know, in the near term, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really around implementing CCPA. And in the longer term it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more potential for further similar regulation across the globe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wehner said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing an impact to the business from CCPA today. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what the impact will be. How things play out will depend on advertiser implementation, adoption rates in terms of opting out of tracking. So there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of uncertainty as to how it plays out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wehner did not offer specifics, but Facebook has taken several steps over the years to comply with CCPA. Indeed, the depth and tone of his answer showed greater concern for it than the July ad boycott of more than 1,100 companies over objectionable content on the social network. The boycott, which included Coca-Cola Co. KO, +0.69% \u00c2 and Ford Motor Co. F, -1.36% \u00c2 , is expected to have minimal drag on Facebook sales. For more: The Facebook ad boycott could pay off for companies more than advertising on Facebook The ominous legal cloud of CCPA, which one data-security expert calls the most far-reaching law affecting California businesses, goes far beyond Facebook. Some 500,000 companies nationwide who deal in data in the Golden State are affected under the law\u00e2\u0080\u0099s broad rules, according to Kimball Parker, CEO of SixFifty, the technology subsidiary of pre-eminent Silicon Valley law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati. CCPA gives internet users the ability to see what information is collected about them and stop that data from being sold. It empowers California\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attorney general to penalize the worst offenders, with fines of $2,500 to $7,500 for each violation. The law broadly applies to businesses that meet any of these three criteria: annual revenue of $25 million; more than half of its revenue through the sale of consumers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 personal information; or handling personal information of more than 50,000 California residents. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor companies, it is a nightmare,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Parker told MarketWatch.

Of course, Facebook and Alphabet\u00c2 face the most total exposure because they reach billions of people and each violation of the law comes with a fine of $2,500 to $7,500. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe fines add up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Parker said. The law has already exacted a steep financial toll for Facebook. The social-networking giant says it has spent billions of dollars shoring up its privacy and security features to comply with laws like CCPA in the U.S. and General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, in the EU. At the same time, Google and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +3.01% \u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who, along with Facebook, command more than 60% of the U.S. digital-advertising market \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have taken significant steps to address the new law. Facebook contends its data policy, with CCPA-related updates, includes information on different types of data that it collects, how the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s products work, and an update on what California consumers need to do to exercise their CCPA rights. In June, the company released a feature, Limited Data Use, that limits how Facebook uses partner data by directing Facebook to act as a service provider when processing information coming from California residents. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve created dozens of teams, both technical and nontechnical, that are focused solely on privacy, and we currently have thousands of people working on privacy-related projects and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re hiring many more,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a Facebook spokesman told MarketWatch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor example, we built self-serve tools that let people access, download and delete the information they share on our service. We make these tools available to everyone on Facebook, regardless of where they are.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The law\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impact is sprinkled throughout Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 10-Q form for its recently completed second quarter. CCPA is mentioned seven times, compared with 40 mentions of COVID-19 and nothing on the boycott. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese laws and regulations [in particular, CCPA and GDPR] are evolving and subject to interpretation, and resulting limitations on our advertising services, or reductions of advertising by marketers, have to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to the 10-Q report. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAny of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, and financial results.\u00e2\u0080\u009d There is little debate the law\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most significant impact will be on the digital-advertising ecosystem, cautions Julian Baring, general manager of Americas at Adform. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCCPA is the latest example of slow march of regulation encroaching on their business models,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Baring told MarketWatch. More on CCPA: What it does, what has changed and what it means for investors The parade of data-privacy laws was largely prompted by Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Cambridge Analytica scandal, when the London-based political consulting firm acquired and used the personal data of up to 87 million Facebook users without their permission. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was a watershed moment for consumers and privacy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Pam Dixon, founder of the World Privacy Forum, a nonprofit public interest research group. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe got [the European Union\u00e2\u0080\u0099s GDPR], CCPA, and a sequel to CCPA. The cost to the business side has been profound [financially], and time consuming for individuals to opt in.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Shaped by real estate millionaire Alastair Mactaggart, CCPA is broadly applied to any company with either annual revenue of $25 million; derives more than half of its revenue through the sale of consumers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 personal information; or handles personal information of more than 50,000 California residents.

It would grant consumers more control over what it calls \u00e2\u0080\u009csensitive personal information\u00e2\u0080\u009d such as a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s race, health, Social Security number and recent locations using GPS technology. If passed into law, consumers would have the right to prevent such data from being sold or used for advertising purposes. More important, CPRA includes the creation of a five-member state agency to enforce privacy protections, instead of the state attorney general under CCPA. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUnder [CPRA], a consumer can limit the use of their sensitive information to stop Uber UBER, -0.18% \u00c2 from profiling them based on race, stop Spotify SPOT, +0.08% \u00c2 from utilizing their precise geolocation and prevent Facebook from using their sexual orientation, health status or religion in its algorithms,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Carmen Balber, executive director of the nonprofit Consumer Watchdog, said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCPRA is coming in another year, and it is another hurdle that is completely cost prohibitive for most companies,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Parker says. Businesses should expect privacy to be a concern front and center for years to come, data experts warn. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFacebook and Google are under so much regulatory pressure, they have the resources, the money and lawyers, be on top of things,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Richy Glassberg, CEO of Safeguard Privacy, which helps hundreds of businesses meet CCPA guidelines. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEverybody else is screwed. It is a continuum to stay ahead of privacy regulation. In a year, Mactaggart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new law will be more like GDPR. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be talking about this a year from now, if it passes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d See also: This California legislator is taking on SmileDirectClub For now, in a new world order of CCPA, most companies are content to comply as much as legally required without revamping their business operations at great cost and possibly weakening product lines, security experts say. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re skirting or toeing the line while still running the same old business model,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Gusto Chief Security Officer Fredrick \u00e2\u0080\u009cFlee\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lee, who has written extensively about CCPA, most recently for Harvard Business Review. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an inverse monotonic relationship between privacy and value,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Vasant Dhar, a professor in the NYU Stern School of Business, where he is director of the Center for Data Science, told MarketWatch in an email message. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe more someone knows about you (less privacy), the more value to them. CCPA introduces friction (you now have to DEAL with being ACCOUNTABLE etc compared to the Wild West days, so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a cost), and it makes it harder to link data which is where a lot of value lies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}]}
