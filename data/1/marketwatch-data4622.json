The task of nominating the party's candidates for president and vice president will be done in Charlotte, N.C., with a limited number of delegates, but the big convention events - chiefly Trump's acceptance speech - will shift to Jacksonville, which raced to put together a proposal and overcame concerns about hotel and arena capacity. The convention will be held Aug. 24-27, according to people familiar with the planning. It places Trump in the most prized swing state, which has 29 electoral votes and which he narrowly won in 2016. \"Not only does Florida hold a special place in President Trump's heart as his home state, but it is crucial in the path for victory in 2020,\" Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said. \"We look forward to bringing this great celebration and economic boon to the Sunshine State in just a few short months.\" An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.
