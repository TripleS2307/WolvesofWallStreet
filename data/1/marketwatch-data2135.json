Fifteen women told the Post they were harassed while working in the NFL team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s front office between 2006 and 2019, 14 of whom requested anonymity because they were fearful of legal reprisals from the team.

Three male members of the team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s front office have left their jobs in the past week, all of whom were named in the Post report. Two other executives who were named left their jobs in 2015 and 2018. The team said Thursday it has hired a law firm to review the allegations. While team owner Daniel Snyder was not accused of harassment, many of the women said he set a poor example and tolerated a toxic corporate atmosphere, claiming he verbally abused top executives, even allegedly forcing a male executive to do cartwheels for his entertainment during a staff meeting. A number of women said their experiences with the team ruined lifelong ambitions. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am done with the NFL,\u00e2\u0080\u009d one anonymous woman told the Post, saying it \u00e2\u0080\u009chas killed any dream of a career in pro sports.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Last week, the team dropped its longtime nickname following decades of complaints that it was racist, following a revolt by team sponsors."}]}
