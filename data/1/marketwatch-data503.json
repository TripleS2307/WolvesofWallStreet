Traders continued to keep an eye on moves in the U.S. dollar and prospects for additional stimulus from Washington. On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated his belief that the U.S. economy needs more fiscal support, even as the recovery from pandemic has been strong thus far. Against that backdrop, December gold GCZ20, +2.17% fell $11.30, or 0.6%, to settle at $1,908.80 an ounce. Prices gave up the bulk of the 0.7% climb they saw on Monday, when they finished at $1,920.10, the highest most-active contract settlement since Sept. 18, according to FactSet data."}]}
