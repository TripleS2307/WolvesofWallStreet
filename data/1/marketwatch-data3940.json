Gold\u2019s performance so far this year is \u201cnot attributed to the pandemic,\u201d said Alex Ebkarian, chief operating officer at Allegiance Gold. \u201cCOVID-19 simply exasperated the underlying weaknesses as evident by the negative real interest rates and further weakening of the dollar.\u201d On Tuesday, the August gold contract US:GCQ20 settled at $1,800.50 an ounce, the highest finish since Sept. 2011, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Based on the most-active futures contracts, prices ended the second quarter with a gain of 12.8%. That was the largest quarter percentage rise since the quarter ended March 2016. Year to date, prices were up 18.2%. Gold accelerated its move towards record highs in the second quarter of this year, as it was \u201calready set on this trajectory\u201d before the seriousness of the coronavirus was even realized, said Peter Spina, president and chief executive officer at GoldSeek.com. The reaction to COVID-19 over the last quarter was of \u201chistoric proportions,\u201d with global debt now soaring and governments injecting trillions of dollars into their economies. Under those conditions, gold is a \u201clower risk shelter to seek refuge,\u201d said Spina. A weaker U.S. dollar also contributed to dollar-denominated gold\u2019s hefty gain for the quarter. The benchmark ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, -0.58% trades more than 1% higher year to date, but was down around 1.7% for the second quarter. Still, there were times so far this year where the usual inverse relationship between gold and the dollar didn\u2019t apply because of a significant shortage in gold supply following the shutdown of the miners, refineries, and mints, and the selloff in gold for liquidity needs to cover short positions, said Ebkarian. The direction of real interest rates matters the most, he said. Since those are near zero in the U.S., \u201cgold\u2019s position is far more compelling than bonds.\u201d Looking ahead, he said he\u2019s paying close attention to any further weakening of real interest rates, as well as an increase inflation. Gold can be used as a hedge against inflation. Ebkarian also said there could be a second wave of COVID-19 infections, which \u201ccould yet again halt parts of our economy.\u201d \u201cConsidering the trifecta global, financial and health crisis, uptick in inflation, market uncertainties, [and] weakening dollar, investors can best position themselves by moderately, proactively diversifying a portion of their portfolio in physical commodities and taking a mid- to long-term approach,\u201d he said. \u201cHistory tells us that post government and Fed interventions and bail outs, gold could double and silver quadruple, as it did between 2008 and 2011.\u201d \u201c \u2018With everything going on, gold could take a step back, but only to take a few more steps forward. Gold has only one way to go, and that is up.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Alex Ebkarian, Allegiance Gold For the second half of the year, before the outcome of the U.S. presidential elections, Allegiance Gold anticipates prices for the yellow metal to be between $1,800 and $2,000 an ounce, said Ebkarian. Gold may top $2,000 with Joe Biden in office as president \u201cas investors will be concerned about the uncertainty of U.S. policies moving forward,\u201d he said. If President Donald Trump gets a second term as president, the gold market \u201ccould trade momentarily either at the current prices or slightly below,\u201d though he also points out that since Trump took office, gold has gone up by roughly 50%. Either way, Allegiance Gold\u2019s 24-month outlook shows gold surpassing $3,000, \u201cas uncertainties with the pandemic, unemployment rate, weakening dollar and debt burden remain,\u201d he said. Spina, meanwhile, expects gold to break to all-time record highs \u201cwithin the next couple of quarters,\u201d and said $2,000 and higher gold is \u201ccoming.\u201d Gold futures saw a record settlement of $1,891.90 on Aug. 22, 2011, according to Dow Jones Market Data, based on records dating back to November 1984.
