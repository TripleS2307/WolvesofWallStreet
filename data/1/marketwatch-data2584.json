The Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study focused on enrolling minority patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia; there are 389 participants enrolled in the trial. However, the drug did not lead to a difference in mortality, Roche said. Roche is also testing Actemra with Gilead Sciences Inc.'s GILD, +0.82% remdesivir, which is the only new drug to receive an emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration as a COVID-19 treatment during the pandemic. Earlier this week Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, +2.20% and Incyte Corp. INCY, +3.19% said their rheumatoid arthritis drug Olumiant when paired with remdesivir shortened recovery time for hospitalized coronavirus patients. Both findings, neither of which have been published yet in a peer-reviewed medical journal, for the first time in months point to a clinical benefit for rheumatoid arthritis drugs when treating some COVID-19 patients after a series of setbacks over the summer.
