After Democrats blocked a Senate Republican bill on the Senate floor Thursday, the way forward is unclear, several senators said. If a package can\u2019t advance on its own, it would need to be married to a temporary spending bill, a prospect that\u2019s already been ruled out. Asked if fiscal stimulus efforts were over until after the November elections, Sen. Richard Shelby, the Alabama Republican who heads the Senate Appropriations Committee, said, \u201cIt looks that way.\u201d \u201cYou know, you never know around here. Sometimes things look bleak and they revive, and so forth. But we thought the scaled down version was a good bill, good timing and everything else. The Democrats obviously thought otherwise.\u201d To advance, the Republican bill needed 60 votes. It only received 52, which was still something of a victory for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. On Wednesday, McConnell had declined to say he had even 51 of his party conference\u2019s 53 votes. No Democrats voted in favor of the bill and one Republican, Rand Paul of Kentucky, crossed the aisle to also vote against it. The bill would have revived a federal add-on payment on top of state jobless benefits, set higher legal liability standards for suing over contracting coronavirus, and renewed Paycheck Protection Program to help keep small businesses afloat. Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, said \u201cI think it\u2019s a 50-50 proposition at this point. I just don\u2019t know to what extent our Democratic colleagues want a deal.\u201d Democrats have held fast to their stance that a bill has to be big one. They have come down to a price tag of $2.2 trillion, $900 billion above Trump the administration\u2019s last offer of $1.3 trillion. The so-called skinny bill Senate Republicans were trying to pass Thursday was even smaller, touted as costing about $500 billion. With House Democrats having approved an even bigger bill than their current offer in May, and Senate Republicans having a bill they can point to as their unified offer, lawmakers in both parties have votes they can talk up in their electorates, even if nothing gets passed until after the election. The last, best hope for a stimulus package probably lies in just parts of it being included in a deal to keep the government open past Sept. 30. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and McConnell have all agreed to work out a stopgap spending bill, even if they haven\u2019t agreed on significant details, like how long its duration should be. Pelosi at her weekly press conference was adamant Thursday on keeping the issues separated. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not going to be in there,\u201d she said when asked if some coronavirus aid could ultimately be included."}]}
