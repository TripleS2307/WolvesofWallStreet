But just how bad was it?", "body": "Whew ! Turns out the U.S. economy didn\u2019t get hurt as badly in July from a resurgence in coronavirus cases as Wall Street feared. But make no mistake: The U.S. recovery did take a blow. The government said Friday that the U.S. regained 1.8 million jobs in July, a number that in any other month would be astonishingly good. But these are obviously not normal times.

The rising number of Covid-19 cases in many American states last month forced many states to reimpose restrictions on businesses and prevent them from rehiring staff. And American consumers themselves have turned more cautious. Adding to the litany of problems, Democrats and Republicans in Congress are still at odds on the next rescue package for the economy, including financial aid for millions of workers who have lost their jobs. A temporary $600 federal benefit supplement for the unemployed expired at the end of July. So did an emergency loan program for small businesses and a moratorium on evictions of delinquent renters. Read:The U.S. has only recovered 42% of the 22.2 million jobs lost from the coronavirus Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West, worries that future increase in employment won\u2019t be so robust. \u201cThis is likely to be the best jobs report we are likely to see for a while and probably exaggerates the health of the U.S. labor market today,\u201d he said. The key is how consumers respond. They\u2019ve lost confidence in the economy over the past month, going out less to shop, eat or travel. If they become even more worried about their jobs or if unemployment benefits aren\u2019t extended, they\u2019re likely to cut spending again as they did early in the pandemic. Retail sales endured a record collapse in March and April. \u201cWithout that gigantic bump in benefits, consumers won\u2019t have the fuel to spend. What is going to happen to consumption?\u201d said Dan North, chief North American economist at credit-insurer Euler Hermes. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to come screeching to a halt.\u201d Read:Consumers hold the key to an economic recovery and right now they\u2019re very anxious Consumer spending accounts for almost 70% of U.S. economic activity. Businesses can\u2019t bring back more workers or increase production if sales flatten out or decline again. Then it becomes a vicious circle: Less spending leads to fewer jobs, and few people working leads to even less spending and more layoffs. The first hint of how households have responded will come toward the end of this week with the retail sales report for July. Sales snapped back strongly in the early stage of the recovery, soaring 18.1% in May and rising an additional 7.5% in June. See: MarketWatch Coronavirus Recovery Tracker Retail sales haven\u2019t returned all the way to pre-crisis levels \u2014 though they are surprisingly close \u2014 but a big slowdown in purchases or, worse, outright decline will send a clear signal that the recovery is flagging. A solid gain of 3% or more, however, would offer a glint of hope that the U.S. rebound is still underway. See:MarketWatch Economic Calendar"}]}
