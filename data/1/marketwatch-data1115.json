Investors also parsed a weaker than expected September employment report from the U.S. Labor Department. What are Treasurys doing? The 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.777% was up 1.7 basis points to 0.694%, extending a 3.5 basis point weekly increase, its largest such move since the week of Aug. 28. While the 2-year note rate TMUBMUSD02Y, 0.156% was unchanged at 0.131%, and virtually flat for the week. The 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, 1.576% rose 2.6 basis points to 1.480%, contributing to a weekly rise of 7.5 basis points. Bond prices move inversely to yields.What\u2019s driving Treasurys? President Donald Trump said he tested positive for the coronavirus after his aide Hope Hicks had also tested positive for the disease. Trump will now enter quarantine, creating fresh uncertainty over the race for the White House in November against Democratic candidate Joe Biden. Bond yields rose in the session after some progress on a new fiscal stimulus bill came into view. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she anticipated reaching a deal, adding that Trump\u2019s diagnosis \u201cchanged the dynamic\u201d of negotiations. The development shifted some focus away from economic data that was expected to command market participants\u2019 attention. The U.S. Labor Department said the economy created 661,000 new jobs in September and the unemployment rate fell again to 7.9% to the lowest level during the pandemic. Economists had forecast 800,000 job gains down from August\u2019s increase of 1.371 million. In other data, the University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment index for last month came in at a reading of 80.4.What did market participants\u2019 say? \u201cYields want to run higher before the election. That\u2019s evident in today\u2019s reaction to surprising news and good economic reports. Investors think the November vote will confirm Biden\u2019s current lead, producing a new government that will add stimulus and address lingering pandemic woes,\u201d said Jim Vogel, an interest-rate strategist at FHN Financial. Trump\u2019s positive test for COVID-19 is \u201cnot going to have a drastic direction on interest-rate markets. Even though it\u2019s directionally going risk-off, the reaction has been very muted. There\u2019s not a lot of people who want to go long or short Treasurys,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital, in an interview."}]}
