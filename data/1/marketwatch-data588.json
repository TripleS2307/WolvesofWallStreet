ActBlue tweeted on Sunday morning that people had given $100 million to \u201ccandidates up and down the ballot and orgs on the front lines of the impending judicial confirmation fight.\u201d More money likely has come in through Monday morning, with Democratic voters inspired to open their wallets as Trump urges the Republican-run Senate to consider his upcoming nomination \u201cwithout delay.\u201d Related: Trump says he\u2019ll name Supreme Court pick on Friday or Saturday Opinion:Here\u2019s what has to happen for Trump and McConnell to seat a new Supreme Court justice before Election Day At the same time, Republicans also see political opportunities in another battle over a Supreme Court vacancy, describing it as an \u201cimportant galvanizing force\u201d for their voters ahead of the Nov. 3 elections. Trump has \u201can opportunity to change the subject\u201d in a White House race that so far has been a \u201creferendum on him and his handling of the COVID pandemic,\u201d said Capital Alpha Partners analyst James Lucier in a note. Separately, Biden\u2019s campaign and its affiliates have reported $466 million in cash on hand as of Aug. 31. That tops by $141 million the $325 million in cash on hand that the Trump campaign and its affiliates have disclosed. The disclosures of cash on hand come after the two sides announced their fundraising hauls for August in early September, with Biden revealing $364.5 million raised vs. Trump\u2019s more than $210 million. Trump had reported a bigger fundraising haul than Biden in July, and the GOP incumbent previously had enjoyed an advantage in cash on hand."}]}
