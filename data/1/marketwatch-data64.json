(AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 A federal judge has denied a motion to extend voter registration in Florida even though a computer meltdown on the final day of registration might have prevented thousands of potential voters from taking part in November\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidential election. In a 29-page ruling on Friday morning, U.S. District Court Judge Mark E. Walker said his decision was \u00e2\u0080\u009can incredibly close call\u00e2\u0080\u009d but added that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interest in preventing chaos in its already precarious \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and perennially chaotic \u00e2\u0080\u0094 election outweighs the substantial burden imposed on the right to vote.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Walker shared in the exasperation of voter advocacy groups even as he ruled against them, peppering his opinion with sharply worded criticisms of the state. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn so ruling, this Court notes that every man who has stepped foot on the Moon launched from the Kennedy Space Center, in Florida. Yet, Florida has failed to figure out how to run an election properly \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a task simpler than rocket science,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the judge wrote. Secretary of State Laurel Lee reopened registrations for seven hours on Tuesday after consulting with Gov. Ron DeSantis, providing another opportunity to people who weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t able to submit their voter registrations online before Monday night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deadline. But Walker said this was too little, too late and done with not enough notice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith the public sounding the alarm, the Secretary of State decided to implement a half measure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Walker wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe hastily and briefly extended the registration period and ordered Florida\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supervisors of election to accept applications submitted by the Secretary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new \u00e2\u0080\u0098book closing\u00e2\u0080\u0099 deadline.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Walker wrote that Lee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009ccure\u00e2\u0080\u009d had at least one major flaw: She did not notify the public until after noon on the date of her new deadline. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis left less than seven hours for potential voters to somehow become aware of the news and ensure that they properly submitted their voter registration applications, all while also participating in their normal workday, school, family, and caregiving responsibilities,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Walker wrote. The final day of the registration period has historically been one of the busiest, as thousands of people register, requesting replacement voter cards or updating addresses and other voter information to be sure their ballots will be counted. Lee, who oversees the voting system, said her office had put in additional servers to accommodate the heightened interest, but misconfigurations in the system prevented it from handling the surge. Florida\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief information officer, James Grant told The Associated Press that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe servers were configured in a way that reduced its capacity to a fraction of a fraction of what it was capable of,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that while denying people opportunities to vote was not their intention, he acknowledged that the system failed on a critical day. The Secretary of State\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Office said the system was overloaded by some 1.1 million requests per hour. During the peak of the slowdown, about 49,000 people were trying to access the system \u00e2\u0080\u0094 many trying repeatedly to register without success. Some gave up and never returned to register to vote despite Lee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to reopen the registration period, said Cloe Cabrera, the spokesperson for Organize Florida, one of the groups that sued the state. Others might not have learned of the next day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s extension. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re disappointed that so many Floridians were disenfranchised because of the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s failure to upkeep the online voter registration system,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cabrera said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA lot of folks who went to the website, which crashed, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go back to the website and they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to exercise their democracy, which is very upsetting,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. Dream Defenders, New Florida Majority, LatinoJustice PRLDEF and others who joined the lawsuit in Tallahassee said at least two additional days were needed to provide citizens with enough time to respond. Anything less would be voter suppression, they said. The groups were considering an appeal, but with Election Day now less than four weeks away, that option might be impractical and sow further chaos into an election season already hampered by the coronavirus outbreak. Florida\u00e2\u0080\u0099s online voter registration system serves the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 67 counties and became operational in October 2017. It has had a few hiccups over the years, but nothing like what happened Monday \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the final day for potential voters to register for the November presidential election. In the last seven hours of Monday, only about 8,100 people successfully accessed the system. Earlier in the day, more than 70,000 Floridians had been able to log on before the system slowed to a crawl at about 5 p.m. Data filed by the state indicates that 50,000 people registered during the extended time period. Based on previous trends, the judge noted, perhaps more than 20,000 additional people might have also registered to vote, if they had been able to access the system. A spokesman for DeSantis, Fred Piccolo, told the AP on Friday that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe governor took quick and decisive action to ensure voter access to multiple registration options including online, in person, or through the mail. There was no basis for federal courts to get involved and the governor expected this outcome.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The judge, however, suggested that the failures gave DeSantis little to be proud of. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis case is about how a state failed its citizens,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPotential voters attempted to perform their civic duty, to exercise their fundamental right, only to be thwarted, once again, by a state that seemingly is never prepared for an election.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}]}
