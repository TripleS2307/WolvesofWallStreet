Trump made the comment during an interview with WECT News of Wilmington, N.C., when a reporter asked if he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s confident in the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voting system, which could see 600,000 absentee votes cast this fall. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey will vote, and then they are going to have to check their vote by going to the poll and voting that way because, if it tabulates, then they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to do that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo let them send it in, and let them go vote. And if their system is as good as they say it is, then obviously they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to vote. If it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tabulated, they will be able to vote. So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the way it is, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what they should do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Voting twice is illegal under both North Carolina and federal law. In North Carolina, it is also illegal \u00e2\u0080\u009cto induce\u00e2\u0080\u009d someone else to fraudulently cast a ballot. Trump has been a frequent and vocal critic of mail-in voting, claiming \u00e2\u0080\u0094 without evidence \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that it is susceptible to fraud. Trump himself has voted by mail a number of times. WECT said the way North Carolina\u00e2\u0080\u0099s system is set up, it is \u00e2\u0080\u009cclerically impossible for a person to vote twice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d because once the mail-in ballot is received, the voter would not be allowed to cast a vote in person. When asked about Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suggestion Wednesday night on CNN, U.S. Attorney General William Barr said Trump was \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrying to make a point,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but declined to say whether voting twice is illegal (it unequivocally is), telling host Wolf Blitzer \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what the law in the particular state says.\u00e2\u0080\u009d iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Separately, federal prosecutors in North Carolina charged 19 noncitizens with voter fraud Wednesday, accusing them of illegally casting ballots in 2016. Few details were disclosed, but one defendant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attorney told the Associated Press: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese cases are clearly timed for partisan political purposes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Read on:A look at claims made by William Barr on mail-in voting, China and more in his Wolf Blitzer interview on CNN"}]}
