Confirmed coronavirus cases have been surging recently across Japan, especially in urban areas like Tokyo and Fukuoka, raising worries people weren\u2019t staying home or social distancing enough. Critics say the government has been sending out conflicting messages, encouraging people to travel and spend with a \u201cGoTo\u201d campaign offering discounts at hotels and resorts while also saying they should avoid unnecessary risks.
