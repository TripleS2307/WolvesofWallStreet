The commission announced earlier that the debate would be virtual. The commission\u00e2\u0080\u0099s announcement came after Trump was hospitalized for COVID-19 and his challenger, Vice President Joe Biden, said he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to participate in a debate in person while Trump remains potentially contagious. The commission said the decision was made \u00e2\u0080\u009cin order to protect the health and safety of all involved with the second presidential debate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Minutes later, in an interview on Fox Business Network, Trump rejected the changes and said he had only learned about them just before they were announced. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to waste my time in a virtual debate that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not what debating is about. You sit behind a computer and do it. And then they cut you off whenever they want,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said. The second debate was set to be in a town hall format in Miami on Thursday, Oct. 15, moderated by C-SPAN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Steve Scully. The candidates would have participated from separate remote locations under the new format announced Thursday. There is precedent for a virtual debate dating back 60 years to the dawn of mass-media campaigns. In 1960, the third debate between John Kennedy and Richard Nixon was held remotely. Kennedy debated from a television studio in New York whil; Nixon appeared from Los Angeles, according to the New York Times. In a statement, Bill Stepien, Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign manager\u00c2 said the president would participate in a rally instead."}]}
