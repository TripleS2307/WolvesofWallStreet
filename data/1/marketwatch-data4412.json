How to cope", "body": "David Ekerdt planned some fun events for the spring of 2020. The newly retired college professor booked a trip to Europe and expected to attend the Indy 500 along with pre-race festivities over Memorial Day weekend. But due to the pandemic, his trip abroad was rescheduled for May 2021 and he didn\u2019t travel to Indiana for the race. He also canceled a family reunion that he planned to host at his home in Kansas City, Mo. \u201cWe planned all these high points in our lives,\u201d he said. \u201cNow they\u2019re all scratched.\u201d Like many older Americans, Ekerdt, 70, realizes that his retirement has turned into something less dreamy and more disappointing. The challenge is coping with squashed expectations. Suddenly stuck at home, retirees who spent decades envisioning how they\u2019d embrace their well-earned freedom are experiencing a mix of emotions. On the positive side, they\u2019re grateful for their health and whatever small joys they can claim. Yet the negatives are stacking up\u2014from alarm at watching the months tick away without travel or embracing the grandkids to anxiety about all the money spent on luxuries that are no longer accessible (good luck finding a flight to that vacation home). \u201cRetirees are entitled to gripe about all the assets they bought,\u201d Ekerdt said. \u201cThey thought they\u2019d be liberated in retirement. But now they\u2019re confined.\u201d For perspective, Ekerdt considers his former colleagues and the stresses they continue to face in the workplace. And he reminds himself that many retirees are experiencing varying degrees of hardship and sacrifice. \u201cIf it had been just me, then I\u2019d be furious it was taken away from me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not the sole loser.\u201d Read: What to do when you inherit your parents\u2019 stuff \u2014 and you don\u2019t want it He suggests two ways to salvage the situation: reconnect with old friends and engage in satisfying domestic activities (from gardening to reading long-neglected books). Your attitude shapes how you respond to an upended retirement. Idleness and stewing resentment fuel a kind of mental meltdown, leaving more time to regret what you don\u2019t have and lash out. Phyllis Diamond, a New York City-based retirement coach and psychotherapist, admires a 68-year-old friend for springing into action and applying herself in new ways. Read: What you need to know about COVID-19 health care rationing \u201cShe lives in a 55+ community where the pool and tennis are closed,\u201d Diamond said. \u201cShe participates in [online] book and movie groups, but she\u2019s a doer and she decided she wants to be leader. So she\u2019s stepping up and taking charge of new initiatives to create, market and organize new programs to bring people together.\u201d Diamond recommends that angry retirees revive old passions and restart old hobbies\u2014or develop new ones. That\u2019s better than allowing waves of grief to immobilize you. \u201cAction is the antidote for anxiety and depression,\u201d she said. \u201cDoing is curative.\u201d She cites her husband\u2019s recent efforts to relearn the guitar, which he stopped playing 40 years ago. Before the pandemic, he\u2019d pick it up once or twice a year for 15 minutes, she says. Now he practices daily and has calluses on his fingertips to prove it. Obsessed with retirement? Subscribe to Retirement Weekly Stay-at-home orders have left otherwise venturesome retirees retreating into a shell. Three months of a restrictive daily routine threaten to dull the senses and stoke negative emotions. \u201cInstead of falling into a routine, look for ways to shake it up,\u201d said Dave Hughes, author of \u201cDesign Your Dream Retirement.\u201d He urges retirees to broaden their range of daily activities, from exploring new walking routes to picnicking in a park."}]}
