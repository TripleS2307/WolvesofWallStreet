For the first time, the Fed will release its economic projections for 2023. Economists expect the Fed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cdot plot\u00e2\u0080\u009d to show that most officials think rates will remain at 0.125%. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s looking like rate hikes are going to be a 2024 story, at the earliest,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Michael Gregory, deputy chief economist at BMO Capital Markets. The Fed will release a policy statement at 2 p.m. Eastern. Powell will hold a press conference a half hour later. Read:Fed is fighting the last battle and there are risks to the strategy While the unemployment rate has shown improvement, the lack of congressional action on another fiscal-aid package leaves the future path of the economy in doubt. The Fed may note the improved economy but not celebrate it. Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, thinks the Fed may adopt \u00e2\u0080\u009cconditional\u00e2\u0080\u009d forward guidance, with officials pledging not to raise rates until specific economic conditions are met. This would follow the Bank of Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s promise not to raise rates until inflation is sustainably back to their 2% target. Most other economists think a change in the Fed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s forward guidance will be delayed until later this year. At the moment, the Fed statement says policymakers expect \u00e2\u0080\u009cto maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Shenfeld said the path of Fed rate policy depends so much on issues that are impossible to pin down. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf someone told me that \u00e2\u0080\u0098I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to raise rates until 2024,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and someone else told me \u00e2\u0080\u0098I think they are going to raise rates at the end of 2022\u00e2\u0080\u0099, I would say both are reasonable guesses,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Shenfeld said. Lewis Alexander, chief economist at Nomura Securities, said he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think the Fed has forged a consensus on forward guidance. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe expect the FOMC to adopt this type of outcome-based forward guidance by the end of the year, but it does not seem ready to do that at this meeting,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Alexander said in a note to clients. Instead, the Fed will take smaller steps, like setting the rationale for their monthly purchases of $120 billion of government bonds and mortgage-backed assets to advance its economic objectives. At the moment, the Fed has said the purchases were needed to \u00e2\u0080\u009csustain market functioning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bigger questions will concern the scale and composition of asset purchases, and the Fed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long-term plan with its $7 trillion balance sheet. This will be the first Fed meeting under its new flexible inflation target strategy. This allows the Fed to let inflation run above 2%, and essentially calls for rates to remain lower for longer. Economists are watching to see how the strategy is incorporated in the statement and projections. Tim Duy, a Fed watcher at the University of Oregon, doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think this will cause major changes in the Fed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presentation Wednesday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor the moment, the Fed remains content to simply entrench expectations that the policy path is locked down at zero for the foreseeable future,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Stocks rose modestly Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% \u00c2 inching up slightly while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% \u00c2 and Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39% \u00c2 posted more solid gains."}]}
