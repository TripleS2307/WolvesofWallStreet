Instead, \u00e2\u0080\u0098mask liaisons\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in blue", "body": "\u00e2\u0080\u009cWould you like a mask?\u00e2\u0080\u009d police officer Michael Miceli asked incoming straphanger Thomas Suh. The officer was in the subway, standing near the booth on the uptown side of the 4/5 station at Wall Street. He was holding a small box of light-blue, disposable face masks, the pleated kind with a thin wire running across the top so the mask fits more snugly against the bridge of the nose. The cop was in full uniform, which these days includes a mask of his own along with a pair of thin, tightfitting surgical gloves. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Suh answered through his own black cotton mask and over the rumble of an uptown 4 train, which was just then arriving on the platform. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA mask,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Miceli repeated. Talking through masks in a noisy subway is never easy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have free masks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Everybody likes free, especially in New York City, where so few things are free. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Suh, who is 34 and was on his way to the going-out-of-business sale at the Century 21 designer-discount store, a couple of blocks away. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCan I have two of them?\u00e2\u0080\u009d The police officer shrugged and handed the man two masks. Welcome to the latest quiet battlefront in New York City\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life-or-death war against the novel coronavirus, which has already infected 244,000 men, women and children in the city, killing 23,767 of them, according to the official count.\u00c2 Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss: I went to the Met, and here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I saw The public-school kids will be back in classrooms by Oct. 1. The first of the indoor diners return Sept. 30. No one knows whether that will make the virus accelerate again. But the subway, the vital irrigation system that nourishes the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy and its cultural life, is struggling mightily to convince 5.5 million daily riders that they can safely pass through the turnstiles again. New York can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t thrive without its subway. And universal mask wearing is at the heart of the revival plans. But the masks are totally useless unless people wear them and wear them properly. This being New York, not everyone is going to comply. Back on April 15, Gov. Andrew Cuomo mandated the use of face masks in public places across New York state. Last week, vowing \u00e2\u0080\u009cto give riders comfort to re-engage the system,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the governor turned up the heat underground, ordering $50 fines for anyone caught without a mask in the subway. The only problem? Mayor Bill de Blasio refused to board the train.

Such enforcement measures, as he put it months earlier, do not \u00e2\u0080\u009creflect our values.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a cop to do? Caught in the middle of this latest standoff between Albany and City Hall are the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s police, especially those assigned to the NYPD Transit Bureau\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 12 districts, who are expected to \u00e2\u0080\u0094 do what exactly? Well, somehow to navigate between two headstrong politicians who can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to agree on much of anything, even something as basic as mask enforcement. Good luck with that! Officer Thomas Saladino hands out masks at the Wall Street subway station.\u00c2 Ellis Henican/MarketWatch The bottom line: Despite the subway\u00e2\u0080\u0099s need to reassure riders that everyone will be masked, city police have been told: no arrests, no fines and, most of all, no viral videos like the one that circulated in mid-May after Kaleemah Rozier, 22, entered the Atlantic Avenue/Barclays Center station in downtown Brooklyn with her 5-year-old son. She had a mask around her chin while she spoke on a cellphone. There isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t much dispute about what happened next since most of it was caught on video. Uniformed police officers asked her politely \u00e2\u0080\u0094 at least three times \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to cover her mouth and nose with the mask. She refused, and the encounter escalated. Rozier cursed at the officers, slapped one in the arm, threatened to \u00e2\u0080\u009ccough on all of you\u00e2\u0080\u009d and rushed off down a stairway. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s when she was grabbed and held on the ground, before being charged with misdemeanor disorderly conduct and resisting arrest and given a desk appearance ticket. Video of the tussle went viral and, after the mayor demanded a \u00e2\u0080\u009creset,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rozier hired attorney Sanford Rubenstein and announced a $10 million lawsuit against the city for her \u00e2\u0080\u009cpsychological injuries.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhatever else was happening in that moment, we should never have a situation when a mom with her child ends up under arrest for that kind of offense \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just not right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d de Blasio said.

Even the cops, he said, have grown more supportive of masks. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt the beginning,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Saladino said, \u00e2\u0080\u009ceveryone in the district was like, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no big deal. Just let it be.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d But once dozens of his fellow officers began testing positive, feelings in the district began to change. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt hit us hard,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut we started taking proper precautions. Gloves. Masks. A lot of Purell. Now everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doing that. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be OK.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ellis Henican is an author based in New York City.
