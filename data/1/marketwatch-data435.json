The new S-Class is powerful, too. The two available engines in the U.S. version of this spacious all-wheel-drive (AWD) sedan include a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6 with 429 horsepower (S 500) or a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V8 with 496 horsepower (S 580). Both powertrains are mounted to a 9-speed automatic transmission, and both profit from an integrated 48-volt starter/generator that aids economy, power, and smoothness. As you\u2019d expect of a flagship Mercedes sedan, the new S, known internally as the W223, is packed with safety and driver-assist technologies, many supported by onboard processing with 50 percent more power. Also, the new 2021 Mercedes-Benz S-Class now has the latest version of the MBUX \u201cHey Mercedes\u201d user interface, which has better voice recognition and can function in 27 languages. Interestingly, the new S also can store seven different driver profiles (each with personalized preset settings for the seats, the mirrors, the audio, the chassis). The car recognizes the driver in four ways: through fingerprint authentication (via a touchpoint), facial recognition (via a tiny camera pointed at the driver), voice identification (using the microphone of the MBUX system), or a PIN that can be entered. Just how luxurious is the new S? Consider this: The heated and cooled front seats of the base model have 10 different massaging programs, each offered in two levels of intensity and in sessions that last 8 or 18 minutes. Each front seat has 18 motors and six fans. The new S also is available with up to five digital screens (two in front and three in back, with one of those being a removable tablet) plus rear-seat frontal airbags. In a frontal collision, airbags deploy from the rear of the front backrests to protect the two folks in each outer rear seat. The bags deploy from a spot below the color touchscreens on the back of the front seats.What\u2019s new for 2021? The S-Class is an all-new vehicle for 2021, based on a new chassis with an aluminum-intensive body. All models that come to the U.S. are long-wheelbase versions with 4Matic all-wheel drive. What we like 4Matic all-wheel drive Potent engine offerings Packed with technology Available rear-seat airbags Available rear-wheel steering What we don\u2019t Expected starting price of about $100,000 Too cautiously styled? No hybrid (or electric model) for the U.S. AMG Line has reduced rear steering angle How much? Estimated at $100,000Fuel economy Buyers in the U.S. have a choice of engines. You can get a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6 (with 429 horsepower and 384 lb-ft of torque) in the S 500. If you even more power, the twin-turbo 4.0-liter V8 in the S 580 puts out 496 horsepower and a whopping 516 lb-ft of torque. Both powerplants mate to a 9-speed automatic transmission, and both have a 48-volt mild hybrid system with an integrated starter/generator that adds21 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. EPA fuel-economy figures for the 2021 Mercedes-Benz S-Class sedans have not been released. For some perspective, consider that last year\u2019s S 450 4Matic, powered by a twin-turbo 3.0-liter V6 with 363 horsepower, was rated by the EPA at 18 miles per gallon city/28 mpg highway. We expect the new S 500, with a turbo 3.0-liter inline-6, to post similar numbers. Also, last year\u2019s S 560 4Matic, powered by a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V8 with 463 horsepower, was rated at 17 mpg city/27 mpg highway. Don\u2019t be surprised if the new S 580, also powered by a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V8, posts similar mpg numbers.Standard features and options Naturally, standard features abound on the 2021 Mercedes S-Class. On the Luxury Line base model (if you can call it that), the S-Class has a panoramic sunroof and a beautiful leather-upholstered interior with a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, a large 12.8-inch central OLED touchscreen, and massaging multi-contour seats with heating and cooling. The 2021 S-Class also has soft-close doors, the latest \u201cHey Mercedes\u201d driver interface, and a navigation system with helpful augmented-reality arrows that point you in the right direction. Read: What\u2019s it like to own an Audi e-tron? Airmatic air suspension and 19-inch alloy wheels are standard, as is a new multifunction steering wheel, wireless smartphone charging, wireless Apple AAPL, +1.74% CarPlay/Android Auto, and a 360-degree surround-view camera. Other standard niceties include power rear sunshades, six USB-C ports, and a Burmester audio system with 15 speakers. While the S-Class AMG Line has some attractive AMG styling cues and unique alloy wheels, the Executive Line is the S-Class with the most standard equipment. Available only as a V8-powered S 580, the Executive Line features active multi-contour seats (with neck & shoulder heating) and an electrically adjustable rear seat. Perhaps most significant, the Executive Line has the auto industry\u2019s first rear-seat airbags designed to protect the outer rear passengers in frontal impacts. The airbags deploy from the back of the front seatbacks, from a spot just below the digital touchscreens. Other S-Class Executive Line hardware includes 4-zone climate control, wireless rear smartphone charging, and rear-seat interface for the MBUX infotainment system. The Executive Line also comes standard with rear-axle steering, which at low speeds contributes up to 10-degrees of opposite-phase rear steering to tighten the turning circle of the big new sedan by 6 feet. While that may not seem like much, the S-Class Executive Line has the same turning radius as the much smaller A-Class sedan, which means it will be much easier to park at the mall (if we ever do that again) or pull a U-turn on a narrow neighborhood street. Also notable: The AMG Line S-Class can be ordered with rear-axle steering, but it gets only 4.5 degrees of it because of clearance issues related to its wider rear tires. Options on the standard S-Class Luxury Line are highlighted by Nappa leather upholstery and a powerful Burmester 4D surround-sound audio system with 30 speakers. Its claim to fame? The seats reverberate to the music, giving the driver and front passenger a good \u201cfeel\u201d for the tunes. (For those wondering, that function can be shut off.) The new S-Class also is available with a 3-D Technology Package (featuring 3-D gauges and a head-up display), plus 20-inch wheels and a Warmth & Comfort Package (heated rear seats and heated front and rear armrests). Also on MarketWatch: Which is better? The Tesla Model S and Model 3 compared S-Class AMG Line models are available with a heated steering wheel and the AMG Night Package, plus a Warmth & Comfort Package and 4.5 degrees of rear-axle steering. You can also order AMG alloy wheels in 20- or 21-inch sizes. As the top S-Class offering, the S 580 Executive Line can be ordered with a finer grade of Nappa leather, a 3-D Technology Package (3-D instrument cluster, a head-up display, and augmented-reality navigation), plus the Warmth & Comfort Package and a system that keeps the driver fresh and alert via the seat massagers and a pleasant smelling air ionizer. Twenty-inch alloy wheels with 10 spokes also are available on the Executive Line.Safety It\u2019s too early to have any crash-test data on the 2021 Mercedes S-Class sedan, either from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). Nevertheless, it\u2019s clear that the new S-Class sedan has been built with occupant safety in mind. Take, for example, the rear-seat airbags that are standard on the S-Class Executive Line. The first of their kind, they deploy from the rear of the front seatbacks to greatly reduce the head and neck loads felt by the two outer rear passengers in a frontal collision. All new S-Class models also benefit from Pre-Safe Plus, which automatically tightens the seat belts (and closes the windows and sunroof) before a collision. It also applies the brakes to prevent the S-Class from rolling post-accident into any other possible dangerous situation. And with Pre-Safe Sound, also standard, the S-Class emits a loud sound right before impact, triggering a protective reflex in the ear that helps prevent hearing damage during the boom of the actual crash.

This, using the E-Active Body Control system, helps direct impact forces at the stronger part of the chassis at the doorsill level. Again, this clever system will make its U.S. debut for the 2022 model year.Behind the wheel Autotrader hasn\u2019t driven the new 2021 Mercedes-Benz S-Class yet.

Mercedes-Benz builds the new S-Class sedan in Sindelfingen, Germany, at a thoroughly modern new facility called Factory 86. How does the new S-Class compare in size to the previous S-Class? The 2021 Mercedes S-Class is a tiny bit larger than the outgoing S-Class. It\u2019s 1.3 inches longer, it has a 2-inch-longer wheelbase, and its front and rear tracks have increased by 1.4 and 2.0 inches, respectively. The headroom in front is about the same as before, but there\u2019s about a half-inch more in back. Rear legroom has improved by about an inch. What\u2019s bigger, the Mercedes S-Class or the BMW 7 Series? The BMW 7 Series is a 207.4-inch sedan with a 126.4-inch wheelbase. At 207.0 inches, the new Mercedes S-Class is fractionally shorter than the big BMW, but it has a longer 127.0-inch wheelbase.Autotrader\u2019s advice If you\u2019re going to be a bear, you might as well be a grizzly. That\u2019s our way of recommending the flagship S 580 Executive Line. Yes, it\u2019s the most opulent S-Class sedan available, and yes, it has the 30-speaker Burmester 4D stereo, but it\u2019s also the only new S-Class with rear airbags and 10 degrees of active rear steering, the latter something we can\u2019t wait to try. Regardless of model, though, the increasingly digital 2021 Mercedes-Benz S-Class sedan is a fitting replacement for the outgoing S, which has had a nice long run.
