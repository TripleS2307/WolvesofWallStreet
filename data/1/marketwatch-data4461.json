The report showed a weekly fall of 98,000 barrels per day in implied demand for finished motor gasoline to 8.55 million barrels a day. Implied demand for distillate fuel oil fell 470,000 barrels per day to 3.22 million barrels a day. \u201cThat fall will tie into broader concerns around a rise in COVID cases in the U.S. and the potential economic headwinds that could bring moving forward,\u201d Fraser said in a daily note. West Texas Intermediate crude for September delivery CL.1, -1.62% US:CLU20 on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 83 cents, or 2%, to settle at $41.07 a barrel, while September Brent crude BRN.1, -0.07% UK:BRNU20 lost 98 cents, or 2.2%, at $43.31 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe. Crude prices finished slightly lower Wednesday, pulling back a day after settling at their highest since March, pressured by an unexpected weekly climb in U.S. crude stockpiles. The EIA reported Wednesday that U.S. crude inventories rose by 4.9 million barrels for the week ended July 17. That compared with an average forecast by analysts polled by S&P Global Platts for a decline of 1.9 million barrels.

Among the petroleum products Thursday, August gasoline US:RBQ20 fell by 1.9% to $1.2586 a gallon and August heating oil US:HOQ20 shed 1.3% to $1.2541 a gallon. Natural-gas futures, meanwhile, rallied as traders eyed storm activity in the Gulf of Mexico. \u201cAa tropical depression is building off the coast of Texas and may develop into Tropical Storm Hanna before reaching land\u201d said Christin Redmond, commodity analyst at Schneider Electric, in a note. \u201cThe storm is likely to hit an area with offshore oil and gas production assets, which may temporarily reduce gas production in the near-term.\u201d Meanwhile, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported Thursday that domestic supplies of natural gas rose by 37 billion cubic feet for the week ended July 17. That was a bit larger than the average increase of 33 billion forecast by analysts polled by S&P Global Platts. August natural gas US:NGQ20 settled at $1.785 per million British thermal units, up 6.2%. That was the highest settlement since July 10, according to Dow Jones Market Data. \u201cSo far this summer, there has not been much of a general weather bid in natural gas as temperatures have not been hot enough to warrant above average energy demand for [air conditioning] needs,\u201d said Richey. But \u201cif forecasts begin to call for late summer heat waves, we could see nat gas make a run back above the $2.00 mark, which could market the beginning of a new uptrend.\u201d"}]}
