Beacon Policy Advisors analyst Ben Koltun has laid out how Trump could get re-elected in a note to clients, touching on the potential for encouraging economic data and positive developments in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe optimistic case for Trump over the next few weeks goes something like this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote in the Thursday note. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe economy continues to improve with voters feeling better about their economic future. Trump heralds a big Q3 GDP figure and the unemployment rate continues to drop. At the same time, COVID-19 begins to get under control and any re-emergence in the Fall is at a far lower rate than expected. The October surprise is Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s announcement of a viable vaccine that can soon begin distribution, with Dr. Anthony Fauci and other scientists and doctors with bipartisan credentials backing up Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s claim of its viability.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Related:Fauci tells Americans to \u00e2\u0080\u0098hunker down\u00e2\u0080\u0099 this fall and winter And see:Fauci says coronavirus vaccine more likely in 2021, not 2020 The take from the Beacon analyst follows a JPMorgan Chase team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s note last week that said \u00e2\u0080\u009cmomentum in favor of Trump will continue, while most investors SPX, +0.87% \u00c2 DJIA, +0.56% \u00c2 are still positioned for a Biden win.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Koltun said Trump also could improve his chances if the president \u00e2\u0080\u009ccleans Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clock\u00e2\u0080\u009d in their first debate on Sept. 29. The analyst then said it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible that Trump \u00e2\u0080\u009closes the popular vote by 3.5 points (despite the polls showing Biden ahead nationally by five),\u00e2\u0080\u009d but he is able to \u00e2\u0080\u009csqueak out a victory\u00e2\u0080\u009d and even gain more electoral votes than he did four years ago. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis optimistic case for Trump is certainly not out of the realm of possibility,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYet, without a Phase Four fiscal deal emerging in Congress, the recent snag in vaccine trials, Trump reportedly not preparing all that much for the debates, and the focus remaining on Trump more than Biden, the optimism for Trump begins to wilt.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Related:Trump marks 9/11 in Pennsylvania, as Biden also visits the swing state Also read:\u00e2\u0080\u0098I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t lie\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Trump spars with reporters over playing down the coronavirus Biden has an edge of almost 4 percentage points over the Republican incumbent in a RealClearPolitics moving average of polls focused on top swing states that are likely to decide the White House race.
