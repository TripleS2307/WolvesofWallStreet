Trump spoke to reporters on Labor Day from the North Portico of the White House \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a rare venue for a presidential press conference. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf Biden wins, China wins, because China will own this country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cToday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Labor Day \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good time to talk about where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re being ripped off by countries, but nobody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even close to China.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump spoke after a\u00c2 New York Times report\u00c2 detailed the former vice president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s longstanding belief that US industries and human rights in China would benefit from boosting China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy through trade. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe New York Times has just published an entire story on Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sellouts, which is amazing for the New York Times. I appreciate that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn 2001 Biden said the United States welcomes the emergence of a prosperous integrated China at the global stage because we expect this is going to be a China that plays by the rules. They didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t play by the rules \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The World Trade Organization \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why they became a rocket ship. They were flatline for years and years and years and they joined the World Trade Organization. And frankly they cheated.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI made a great trade deal with China\u00e2\u0080\u009d in January before the coronavirus pandemic and \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re buying [US products]. You know why? They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re buying because they know I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not happy. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why they buy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But Trump vowed to punish China for \u00e2\u0080\u009csending\u00e2\u0080\u009d COVID-19 overseas, including by \u00e2\u0080\u009cdecoupling\u00e2\u0080\u009d economically. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll end reliance on China once and for all, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decoupling or putting in massive tariffs like I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been doing already. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to end our reliance on China, because we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t rely on China,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said. Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Lily Adams denounced Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s speech as \u00e2\u0080\u009cincoherent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cTrump ignored the economic havoc he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s created and lied his way through a series of debunked political attacks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Adams said. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic nationalism regarding China comes as he works to again win the Rust Belt states that struggled with globalization. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will manufacture our critical medical supplies in the United States, we will create Made in America tax credits and bring our jobs back from China to the United States and we will impose tariffs on companies that desert America to create jobs in China and other countries,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will prohibit federal contracts from companies that outsource to China, and will hold China accountable for allowing the virus to spread around the world. Now you can understand why China would much rather see Sleepy Joe than Donald Trump.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Trump administration recently sanctioned Chinese officials\u00c2 for eliminating Hong Kong\u00e2\u0080\u0099s political autonomy\u00c2 and detaining Uyghur Muslims in re-education camps, as the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a dramatic souring in relations. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause of Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic treachery was 60,000 shuttered American factories. I heard this morning that the real number is probably 70,000\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talking about how wonderful it is with China. No, China has been very bad \u00e2\u0080\u0094 on top of which we had the China virus sent to us\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 We had other viruses sent in over the years that came from China. I wonder why.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}]}
