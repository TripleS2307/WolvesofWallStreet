On Tuesday, Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc. INO, -1.36% \u00c2 shared the first data from the Phase 1 clinical trial for its coronavirus vaccine candidate, and the FDA issued guidance telling developers that approval requires a vaccine to reduce the risk of COVID-19 by 50% when compared with placebo. A day later, BioNTech BNTX, +1.23% \u00c2 and Pfizer Inc. PFE, -0.27% \u00c2 jumped into the fray, sharing that their experimental vaccine had generated neutralizing antibodies at a higher level than what has been reported in people recovering from a COVID-19 infection. The news sent Inovio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stock down and pushed up shares of BioNTech and Pfizer. The rocky investor response once again showcases the complexity of developing a vaccine, as quickly as possible, for a virus that came to the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention seven months ago, when there are still questions about what kind of immunologic protection antibodies for this virus can provide. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe would not expect the initial generation of vaccines to be silver bullets in terms of conferring nearly complete protection,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bernstein analysts wrote in an investor note on Wednesday, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand questions on the ability to inhibit transmission or the durability of immunity remain to be addressed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Read: Race for a COVID-19 vaccine has drug makers scaling up manufacturing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 before one is developed BioNTech and Pfizer have released the most detailed information so far among the vaccine candidates being tested in the U.S. They said that 24 participants in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial who received two doses of the lower-dose vaccines developed neutralizing antibodies, an indicator that the experimental vaccine can generate antibodies at the same level or higher than those seen in convalescent sera, which is collected from people who have recovered from COVID-19. The data sent shares in both companies up in trading on Wednesday; BioNTech, which had its stock halted briefly, by 8.7%, and Pfizer, by 4.8%. The Bernstein analysts called the data \u00e2\u0080\u009csolid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d saying the vaccine candidate is a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccredible\u00e2\u0080\u009d player in the rapidly expanding coronavirus vaccine field. Mizuho Securities\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Vamil Divan said the candidate showed a \u00e2\u0080\u009crobust immune response.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That said, none of the clinical research that has been shared so far about vaccines being developed in the U.S. from BioNTech and Pfizer, Inovio, and Moderna Inc. MRNA, +0.09% \u00c2 has been peer reviewed. (Moderna released preliminary data from its Phase 1 trial in May and is expected to publish detailed findings from the Phase 1 trial in a medical journal, as is Inovio and BioNTech and Pfizer, which published their Phase 1 data as a preprint on Wednesday.) Inovio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disclosure of Phase 1 data for its vaccine candidate was somewhat limited. It said 94% of 36 trial participants showed \u00e2\u0080\u009coverall immunological response rates based on preliminary data assessing humoral (binding and neutralizing) and T cell immune responses.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Its stock hit a record high of $31.69 on Monday and has since tumbled, closing at $26.95 on Tuesday, when it announced the data. Shares were down 26.8% in trading on Wednesday.

However, he remains bullish on the probability of Inovio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vaccine moving forward in clinical testing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn truth, while we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what \u00e2\u0080\u0098good\u00e2\u0080\u0099 immunogenicity data should be, studies suggest that both T cell and antibody immune responses will be important for protection in both mild and serious infections,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe early data for INO-4800 appear to be promising.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The FDA guidance calls for vaccines to prevent infection with the virus, and the regulator won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t approve a vaccine \u00e2\u0080\u009con the basis of just immunogenicity as some investors, developers and commentators have suggested,\u00e2\u0080\u009d SVB Leerink\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Geoffrey Porges wrote in an investor note. What that means is that it may take longer to approve a vaccine than what government officials have promised the American public. The Department of Health and Human Services has said it would have 300 million doses of a vaccine by January as part of the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Operation Warp Speed program. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe guidelines do not suggest that a widely usable vaccine will be available at \u00e2\u0080\u0098warp speed\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in 2020,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Porges wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe tone and clarity of the document suggests that regardless of political pressure, the FDA continues to apply sound regulatory judgment and expertise.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Since the start of the year, the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund XLV, +0.90% \u00c2 has declined 0.8%, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% \u00c2 is down 4.0%.
