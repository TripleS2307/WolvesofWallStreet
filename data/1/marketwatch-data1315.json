The Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index slipped to 54.6% in September from a 21-month high of 56% in the prior month. Readings over 50% indicate growth. Although the index declined for the first time since April and fell short of the 56.5% MarketWatch forecast, the tenor of the September ISM report was quite positive. New orders and production were strong again and a contraction in employment since the start of the pandemic neared an end. \u201cManufacturing performed well in the month with demand, consumption and inputs registering growth indicative of a normal expansion cycle,\u201d said Timothy Fiore, chairman of the survey. \u201cWhile certain industry sectors are experiencing difficulties that will continue in the near term, the manufacturing community as a whole has learned to conduct business effectively and deal with the variables imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d he said. What happened: Fourteen of the 18 industries tracked by ISM expanded in September. The index for new orders slipped 7.4 points, but it was still quite robust at 60.2%. Ditto for production: The gauge fell 2.3 points to 61%, but any reading over 60 is very vigorous. \u201cBusiness has continued to be strong, with September following August. October is also shaping up to be a good sales month as well,\u201d said a senior executive at company that makes plastics and rubber products. Another executive at a maker of electrical equipment said, \u201cDemand remains high, strong finish to 2020 projected, with an even stronger 2021 fiscal year.\u201d Perhaps the best news was an increase in the employment index to 49.6% from 46.4% \u2014 a sign companies are ready to hire or bring back most of their workers.

The gauge tends to rise or fall in tandem with the health of the economy. See: MarketWatch Economic Calendar Big picture: The sharp rebound in manufacturing shown by the ISM survey suggests the U.S. economy is recovering faster than expected, but business has by no means returned to normal. What the ISM survey is designed to reveal is simply whether business is getting better or worse each month, not how much better. Most manufacturers are still producing fewer goods with fewer workers than they were before the pandemic, and it\u2019ll likely be some time before output and employment climb above pre-crisis levels given depressed demand at home and abroad.
