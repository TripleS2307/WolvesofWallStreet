In a petition to the Federal Communications Commission, the Commerce Department called for an FCC rule-making to reinterpret key elements of Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act. That provision has given online companies broad immunity from legal liability for their users\u2019 actions, and wide latitude to police content on their sites. \u201cUnfortunately, large online platforms appear to engage in selective censorship that is harming our national discourse,\u201d the petition says. \u201cThe FCC should determine how Section 230 can best serve its goals of promoting internet diversity and a free flow of ideas, as well as holding dominant platforms accountable for their editorial decisions, in new market conditions and technologies that have emerged since the 1990s.\u201d The action follows complaints by President Donald Trump and others who say left-leaning Silicon Valley technology companies unfairly censor conservative views on their digital platforms. The internet industry has dismissed those claims, and is expected to resist attempts to reframe Section 230 as an intrusion on the free-speech rights of technology companies. In a statement, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said the commission will carefully review the petition. But FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, said the panel \u201cshouldn\u2019t take this bait.\u201d \u201cWhile social media can be frustrating, turning this agency into the President\u2019s speech police is not the answer,\u201d Rosenworcel said in a statement. \u201cIf we honor the Constitution, we will reject this petition immediately.\u201d An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.
