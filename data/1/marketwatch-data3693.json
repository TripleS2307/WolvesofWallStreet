Investors have wrestled with rising daily rates of new U.S. coronavirus cases all week and that again cast a pall over the stock market on Friday. U.S. states saw a single-day record rise of 37,000 in infections on Thursday, led by Florida, Texas, California and Arizona, surpassing the 36,188 level from April 24, according to analysis of data from Bloomberg. That case count \u201cblew out any of the previous records,\u201d said Will Geisdorf, senior research analyst with Sarasota, Fl-based Allegiant Private Advisors. \u201cI think the markets are looking at that and starting to discount the potential for a V-shaped recovery.\u201d As evidence mounts that consumers are losing confidence, there will be pressure on policymakers to deliver another round of fiscal stimulus, Geisdorf said in an interview. \u201cThat\u2019s what markets need to get out of this period of consolidation and volatility and continue higher. We\u2019ve had the best 50-day period in market history. Some sort of correction was needed to relieve excessive optimism.\u201d Governors in Texas and Florida ordered all bars to close again on Friday, making the states the first to reverse some reopening measures after months of lockdowns. Texas reported 6,426 new coronavirus cases Thursday, according to Johns Hopkins University data, and Florida reported over 8,900. Overall, total cases in the U.S. have topped 2.4 million and that increase, notably in southern and western states in the U.S., has also resulted in business reopening plans being halted in North Carolina, Louisiana and Kansas. However, governors in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are proceeding with reopening efforts but imposing a 14-day quarantine for visitors from some hard-hit states. \u201cThe market has been threatened by anything that jeopardizes the economic recovery,\u201d Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial, told MarketWatch. \u201cWhat you are seeing is the market react to the headlines,\u201d she said. The key for some investors is determining the degree by which the rise in cases results in hospitalizations and deaths, Krosby said. \u201cIt will give us a sense of whether the therapeutic treatments are working,\u201d she said. Investors are also digesting the results of the Federal Reserve\u2019s annual bank stress tests which requires banks to preserve capital by suspending share repurchases and cap dividend payments in the third quarter based on average net income over the past four quarters.

However, personal incomes sank 4.2% last month, reflecting the mass unemployment. \u201cConsumer demand will probably look good in June as well, supported by the reopening in the Northeast and a still-elevated savings rate,\u201d wrote Jefferies analysts Aneta Markowska and Thomas Simons. \u201cHowever, stimulus payments are now shrinking and dragging down overall income growth,\u201d the wrote.
