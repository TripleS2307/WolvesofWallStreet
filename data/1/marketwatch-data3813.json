The decline marked the sharpest one-day fall since April 27 and the settlement was the lowest since June 1, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Global benchmark Brent oil for August delivery UK:BRNQ20 retreated $3.18, or 7.6%, at $38.55 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe, following a 1.3% gain. Prices also finished at their lowest since June 1 and the day\u2019s slide represented Brent\u2019s steepest since April 21. The Energy Information Administration reported Wednesday that U.S. crude inventories rose by 5.7 million barrels for the week ended June 5. That defied a forecast by analysts polled by S&P Global Platts for an average decline of 3.2 million barrels. Meanwhile, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday emphasized that the economic outlook for the U.S. would be challenging as the central bank kept rates at a range of 0% and 0.25% following its policy meeting and warned that millions of people might not return to their jobs. \u201cIn the last weeks, oil prices have rallied on the back of supply curtailments that have largely brought global crude inventories under control, but prices are once again under pressure as concerns over the pace of the demand recovery intensified,\u201d wrote Paola Rodriguez Masiu, senior oil markets analyst at Rystad Energy, in a Thursday note. A weaker recovery from the pandemic that has hobbled much of the global economy can damage demand for crude oil and its byproducts as the industry struggles with concerns about the efficacy of measures to limit oil output. Traders are also concerned about signs that coronavirus cases in the U.S. are continuing to rise and topped the 2 million mark just as businesses are resuming activity. The global case tally for the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 climbed to 7.39 million on Thursday, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. \u201cRisk assets, including crude oil and equities are under pressure today from an increase in coronavirus cases,\u201d said Robert Yawger, director energy futures at Mizuho Securities USA, in a Thursday note. \u201cEvidence is building that a second wave of COVID-19 cases is building in Arizona, Texas, Florida, and California,\u201d he wrote. The oil market had been reacting to recovering demand as business activity had begun to restart amid signs that the coronavirus pandemic was receding in most developed countries, as well as the newly extended pact between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, collectively known as OPEC+, to cut production by 9.7 million barrels a day through July. OPEC+ delivered 85% of its agreed production cuts last month, according to a survey conducted by S&P Global Platts, released Wednesday. Back on Nymex, prices for petroleum products followed oil lower, with July gasoline US:RBN20 down 7.5% at $1.1188 a gallon and July heating oil US:HON20 losing nearly 7.3% to $1.088 a gallon. Natural-gas futures settled higher after the EIA reported Thursday that domestic supplies of natural gas rose by 93 billion cubic feet for the week ended June 5. On average, analysts polled by S&P Global Platts forecast an increase of 95 billion. July natural gas US:NGN20 ended at $1.813 per million British thermal units, up nearly 1.9%."}]}
