La Ni\u00f1a is a weather pattern in the Pacific Ocean that is the colder counterpart of the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon and can have a global impact on weather, affecting crops in many parts of the world. Lower soybean production may provide a further boost for prices which have already risen significantly recently on growing demand from China and prices rising to their highest levels in over two years. Soybean futures SX20, +1.47% S00, +1.47% settled at $10.285 a bushel on Sept. 17, the highest finish since May 2018. They trade nearly 8% higher for the year and have rallied by 25% from their March low. The commodity has defied an overall decline of almost 11% in the Bloomberg Commodity Index BCOM, +1.51%, with the Bloomberg Soybeans Subindex up nearly 4% for the year. Before the rally this year, soybeans suffered from \u201cdemand destruction caused by the coronavirus and swine fever in China, forecasts of global oversupply, and a stronger U.S. dollar,\u201d says Jeff Klearman, portfolio manager at GraniteShares, which offers the GraniteShares Bloomberg Commodity Broad Strategy No K-1 exchange-traded fund COMB, +1.44%. Klearman also points out that meat-processing plants around the world had been forced to shut down to stem the spread of Covid-19, reducing demand for livestock and hogs and leading to reduced soybean demand for animal feed. A weaker U.S. dollar this year, combined with dry weather conditions in the U.S. Midwest, strong Chinese demand, the reopening of meat-processing plants, and a \u201clessening threat\u201d of swine fever in China, have all helped move soybean prices higher, says Klearman. China has been a strong buyer of soybeans, in part, as a \u201cprecautionary measure against increased U.S.-China trade frictions.\u201d China\u2019s soybean imports reached a record 98 million metric tons for the 2019-20 crop year ended in August, and are expected to reach a record again for 2020-21, with some estimates running above 100 million metric tons, says Sal Gilbertie , president at Teucrium Trading. Summertime demand from China for agricultural products had already been \u201cunusually large\u201d because of weather issues that affected Chinese crop production and due to the nation\u2019s \u201caggressive\u201d efforts to rebuild their swine herd, says Gilbertie. If China\u2019s production problems turn out to be worse than expected, that could tighten the global soybean balance sheet even further, he says. At the same time, the Chinese are also \u201cadept at buying for their strategic stockpiles when prices are low. Global 2020-21 soybean ending stocks, or the amount of supplies left over after demand has been met, are expected to stand at 93.59 million metric tons, representing a more-than-17% decline from two years earlier, Gilbertie says. That\u2019s \u201can enormous decline for such a vital commodity.\u201d Further contributing to worries about tighter supplies, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said on Sept. 10 that a La Ni\u00f1a climate pattern has developed and is expected to persist through the winter. That raises the likelihood of soybean production disruptions. \u201cLa Ni\u00f1a generally affects all the major agricultural crops in some way, from coffee to wheat,\u201d says Gilbertie. \u201cDryness associated with La Ni\u00f1a in the United States, southern Brazil, and Argentina tends to negatively affect soybean, corn, and wheat production.\u201d Tightening soybean supplies have already lifted prices to their \u201cpre-trade-war multiyear trading range of between $9 and $12 per bushel,\u201d he says. The U.S. and Brazil are the top two soybean exporters, so \u201cbeans in the teens\u201d is the most likely scenario in an extreme La Ni\u00f1a event, says Craig Turner, senior commodities broker at Daniels Trading. That suggests that soybean prices may climb up to $13 or beyond. Futures prices haven\u2019t climbed to levels that high since 2014. \u201cIf South America has substantial production issues due to La Ni\u00f1a, then the global soybean market would be forced into dramatic price rationing,\u201d he says."}]}
