The dollar DXY, -0.58% \u00c2 slipped to its lowest level in two years on Monday as it lost more ground to major rivals. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a trade war, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a technology war, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a geopolitical war and there could be a capital war \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the reality,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dalio said on Fox\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cSunday Morning Futures.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you say by law, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t invest in China or even possibly withholding the payment of bonds that the United States owes payment on in China, these things are possibilities and they have big implications, such as for the value of the dollar because premarket investors are not used to having those things dictated by the government,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. The Bridgewater Associates founder added that these difficult questions had to be \u00e2\u0080\u009cwell-addressed\u00e2\u0080\u009d and it was a challenge for the government to get the policy right.

On March 22, the index hit a more-than-three year intraday high. When asked whether he was worried about the dollar, Dalio warned the U.S. was its \u00e2\u0080\u009cown worst enemy\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that he was concerned about the \u00e2\u0080\u009csoundness of our money.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t continue to run deficits, sell debt or print money rather than be productive and sustain that over a period of time. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work together to do the sound things, to be productive, to earn more than we spend, to build the stability of our currency and build a good balance sheet, we are going to decline,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.
