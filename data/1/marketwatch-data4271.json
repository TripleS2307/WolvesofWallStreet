While greatly expanded testing probably accounts for some of the increase, experts say other measures indicate the virus is making a comeback. Daily deaths, hospitalizations and the percentage of tests that are coming back positive also have been rising over the past few weeks in parts of the country, mostly in the South and West. In Arizona, 23% of tests conducted over the past seven days have been positive, nearly triple the national average, and a record 415 patients were on ventilators. Mississippi saw its daily count of confirmed cases reach record highs twice this week. \u201cIt\u2019s not a joke. Really bad things are going to happen,\u201d said Dr. Thomas Dobbs, Mississippi\u2019s health officer. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas put off lifting any more restrictions and reimposed a ban on elective surgeries in some places to preserve hospital space after the number of patients statewide more than doubled in two weeks. Republican Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona also said further efforts to reopen are on hold as cases surge. Sandwiched between the two, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, worried about rising numbers and the risks posed by her neighbors, declaring, \u201cWe\u2019re on hold.\u201d \u201cThe last thing we want to do as a state is go backwards and close down businesses,\u201d Abbott said. The U.S. reported 34,500 COVID-19 cases Wednesday, slightly fewer than the day before but still near the high of 36,400 reached April 24, according to a count kept by Johns Hopkins University. The daily average has climbed by more than 50% over the past two weeks, an Associated Press analysis found. The true numbers are probably much higher because of limited testing and other factors. Whether the rise in cases translates into an equally dire surge in deaths across the U.S. will depend on a number of factors, experts said, most crucially whether government officials make the right decisions. Deaths per day nationwide are around 600 after peaking at about 2,200 in mid-April. \u201cIt is possible, if we play our cards badly and make a lot of mistakes, to get back to that level. But if we are smart, there\u2019s no reason to get to 2,200 deaths a day,\u201d said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of Harvard\u2019s Global Health Institute. The nation\u2019s daily death toll has actually dropped markedly over the past few weeks even as cases climbed, a phenomenon experts said may reflect the advent of treatments, better efforts to prevent infections at nursing homes and a rising proportion of cases among younger people, who are more likely than their elders to survive a bout with COVID-19. \u201cThis is still serious,\u201d said Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but \u201cwe\u2019re in a different situation today than we were in March or April.\u201d Several states set single-day case records this week, including Arizona, California, Nevada, Texas and Oklahoma. Florida reported over 5,000 new cases for a second day in a row. Mississippi\u2019s Dobbs blamed a failure to wear masks and observe other social-distancing practices. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s going to take some kind of catastrophe for people to pay attention,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are giving away those hard-fought gains for silly stuff.\u201d Tom Rohlk, a 62-year-old grocery store worker from Overland Park, Kansas, complained that young people sometimes act as if they don\u2019t care: \u201cIt seems like it\u2019s time to party.\u201d The U.S. has greatly ramped up testing in the past few months, and it is now presumably finding many less-serious cases that would have gone undetected earlier in the outbreak, when testing was limited and often focused on sicker people. But there are other more clear-cut warning signs, including a rising number of deaths per day in states such as Arizona and Alabama. The numbers \u201ccontinue to go in the wrong direction,\u201d Ducey said. \u201cWe can expect our numbers will be worse next week and the week after.\u201d The number of confirmed infections, in itself, is a poor measure of the outbreak. CDC officials, relying on blood tests, estimated Thursday that 20 million Americans have been infected. That is about 6% percent of the population and roughly 10 times the 2.3 million confirmed cases. Officials have long known that many cases have been missed because of testing gaps and a lack of symptoms in some infected people. Worldwide, over 9.5 million people have been confirmed infected, and nearly a half-million have died, including over 124,000 in the U.S., the world\u2019s highest toll, by Johns Hopkins\u2019 count. While some states impose new restrictions or pause their reopenings, some businesses also are backing off. Disney delayed its mid-July reopening of Disneyland. As politicians try to strike a balance between public health and the economy, the government reported that the number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits last week declined slightly to 1.48 million, indicating layoffs are slowing but still painfully high. Elsewhere around the world, Paris\u2019 Eiffel Tower reopened to visitors after its longest peacetime closure: 104 days. With hospitals overwhelmed in New Delhi, Indian troops provided care in railroad cars converted to medical wards."}]}
