IQ, +0.84% rocketed 35% in very active trading Tuesday, after Reuters reported that Tencent Holdings Ltd. TCEHY, +1.98% 700, +0.84% was looking to become the largest shareholder in the China-based provider of video streaming services. Trading volume ballooned to 1.9 million shares, enough to make it the most actively traded stock ahead of the open. Tencent's U.S.-listed shares were still inactive in the premarket. Reuters reported, citing people familiar with the matter, that Tencent, a China-based social media and gaming giant, approached Baidu Inc. BIDU, -0.20%, which owns 56% of iQIYI, about buying a stake in iQIYI, but had not yet determined the size of that stake. The report said it was not immediately clear if Tencent approached iQIYI for what the nature of any cooperation would entail. IQIYI's stock has rallied 9.0% over the past three months through Monday, while Tencent shares have run up 29.2% and the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% has climbed 28.5%."}]}
