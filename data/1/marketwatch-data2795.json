Getty Images When it comes to essential reading for a modern central banker, John Maynard Keynes and Milton Friedman have nothing on Mark Twain. After all, Tom Sawyer convinced his friends to complete his punishment of whitewashing a fence by facetiously proclaiming how much fun he found the tedious task \u2014 even getting them to effectively pay for the privilege. While the Fed isn\u2019t relying on the same chicanery and reverse psychology employed by Twain\u2019s fictional hero, it has managed to get market participants, so far, to do some of its heavy lifting when it comes to backstopping the corporate credit market. The Fed, which launched its Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility in March, had tapped only 4% of its $250 billion asset-buying capacity as of June 30, noted Peter Wilson, global fixed income analyst at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, in a Monday note. Investors, however, have rushed into the market to buy far more. Wilson observed that as of June 30, the Fed facility had bought $9.6 billion in assets \u2014 almost $8 billion in corporate bond exchange-traded funds and around $1.6 billion in individual bonds. Meanwhile, the total assets of the largest U.S. investment-grade corporate ETF had doubled since March 19, hitting $56.5 billion as of July 14. As a result, corporate bond spreads \u2014 the premium investors demand to hold the debt over \u201crisk-free\u201d U.S. Treasurys \u2014 have narrowed sharply despite the lack of more aggressive buying by the central bank, meaning that private demand \u201chas done the Fed\u2019s work, swamping those modest purchases,\u201d Wilson said. The literary comparisons only go so far. The Fed\u2019s success is attributable, in part, to its credibility. \u201cIf market participants have sufficient faith that the Fed will buy enough bonds to stabilize and narrow credit spreads, then they will likely seek to buy before those spreads are narrowed\u2014and that is exactly what happened. A strong belief that the Fed \u2018has the market\u2019s back\u2019 can be a powerful\u2014and \u2018cheap\u2019\u2014form of financial stability policy,\u201d Wilson wrote. That isn\u2019t the only driver. Wilson also cites the \u201cportfolio rebalance effect,\u201d which academics have described as part of the mechanism of government bond purchases through quantitative easing. The idea, Wilson noted, is that QE stimulates the economy by lowering returns on low-risk assets, in this case, Treasurys, to a level that effectively forces private-sector investors to rebalance their portfolios by buying more risky assets, such as corporate bonds. And then there\u2019s a third channel \u2014 cheaper currency hedging costs, Wilson said. By cutting the fed-funds rate to virtually zero, the differential between rates in the U.S. and the rest of the world has been significantly lowered. That makes it much cheaper for overseas buyers of U.S. dollar-denominated bonds to hedge their currency risk. \u201cThis means that Japanese institutions (for example) can buy U.S. bonds, remove the risk of dollar depreciation undercutting returns, and in many cases, achieve a yen-based yield better than that seen for several years, and\u2014importantly\u2014far above the yield available on equivalent domestic (Japanese) assets ,\u201d he wrote. Meanwhile, the narrowing of corporate yield spreads relative to Treasurys, in turn, may be driving demand for stocks, analysts said. Equities have roared back to reclaim much of the pandemic-influenced fall that took the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% from a record close on Feb. 19 to a 34% fall through March 23. The large-cap benchmark ended around 4% below its all-time closing high on Monday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% remained around 9.7% below its Feb. 21 record finish. The Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39% on Monday posted a record close. Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse, argued that the tightening of corporate spreads has been a more important driver than recent moves in the Treasury market, where yields fell in step with stocks during February and March but have subsequently flatlined. \u201cWhile rising yields signal an improving economy, they also contribute to a higher cost of capital \u2014 a negative for stocks. By contrast, tighter credit spreads signal economic vibrancy and lower the cost of capital \u2014 a positive.,\u201d he said, in a Monday note. \u201cContrary to conventional wisdom, the economic signal from Treasury yields and spreads is far more important than the shifting cost of capital.\u201d"}]}
