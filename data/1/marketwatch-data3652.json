MPC, -3.21%, fresh from the sale of its gas stations to the owners of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain for $21 billion in the largest U.S. energy deal of the year, posted second-quarter earnings Monday, showing a smaller-than-expected adjusted loss but revenue that lagged estimates. The company said it had net income of $9 million, or 1 cent a share, in the quarter, after income of $1.1 billion, or $1.66 a share, in the year-earlier period. The figure includes a net pretax benefit of $1.4 billion. Excluding that benefit, the company's adjusted loss per share came to $1.33 a share, narrower than the $1.77 loss per share consensus of FactSet analysts. Revenue fell to $15.024 billion from $33.529 billion, below the $21.729 billion FactSet consensus. \"Our second quarter results reflect a full three months of the challenges COVID has created for our business,\" Chief Executive Michael J. Hennigan said in a statement. \"We began April with demand at historic lows. Despite seeing some recovery during the quarter, demand for our products and services continues to be significantly depressed, particularly across the West Coast and Midwest.\" The company is indefinitely idling its Gallup and Martinez refineries and evaluating a strategic repositioning of Martinez to a renewable diesel facility. It's on track to deliver $1.4 billion capex cuts and at least $950 million of operating expense cuts. Shares rose 6% premarket, and are down 37% in the year to date, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% has gained 1.3%."}]}
