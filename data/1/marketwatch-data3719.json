TRIP, +0.74% said Monday that it expects June revenue to be about 20% of last year's comparable period total as the coronavirus slowdown in the travel sector continues to hurt results. April and May revenue totaled about 10% of the 2019 comparable period. Monthly unique users in April were 33% versus last year, May was 45%, and June month-to-date is showing further improvement. TripAdvisor has announced significant staff cuts and other actions to manage costs. As of May 31, the company had $693 million of cash and cash equivalents down $105 million from March due to merchant refunds and other items. TripAdvisor says it still believes it has sufficient liquidity to withstand a period of revenue disruption and meet its debt covenants in 2020 and 2021, though it may consider measures to raise capital in the future. Second quarter earnings are scheduled to be announced in early August. TripAdvisor stock slipped nearly 1% in Monday premarket trading, and has fallen 40.2% for the year to date. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% is down 4.1% for 2020 so far."}]}
