And the topical sketch show drew its biggest season premiere audience in four years while recapping the previous week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s particularly manic news cycle. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSNL\u00e2\u0080\u009d boasted a marquee lineup for its 30 Rock return, including comedian Chris Rock as the host, rapper Megan Thee Stallion as the musical guest \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and, of course, Jim Carrey making his debut as former Vice President Joe Biden alongside guest stars Alec Baldwin and Maya Rudolph reprising their roles as President Donald Trump and Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s running mate Sen. Kamala Harris, respectively. The broadcast drew 7.765 million viewers overall, according to early Nielsen Media Research numbers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 making it the Comcast-owned CMCSA, -0.99% \u00c2 NBC show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most-watched debut since 2016, when Margot Robbie hosted and The Weeknd performed. Also of note: the live audience, which largely consisted of first responders, was paid to show up, the New York Times reported. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pandemic reopening guidelines still ban the public from going to live TV shows \u00e2\u0080\u0094 unless the show pays its crowd like cast members. Here are four of the most buzzed-about moments from \u00e2\u0080\u009cSaturday Night Live\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u009d Season 46 premiere over the weekend.

Baldwin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Trump interrupted Carrey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Biden repeatedly, leading Carrey to take out a remote control at one point and hit a mute button to stop Baldwin from interrupting again. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe in science and karma,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Carrey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Biden said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, just imagine if science and karma could somehow team up to send us all a message about how dangerous this virus can be\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, alluding to Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s later COVID-19 diagnosis. Rudolph\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Harris also came out during the middle of the debate to tell the \u00e2\u0080\u009cboys\u00e2\u0080\u009d to try to get the debate back on the rails, and referred to herself as the \u00e2\u0080\u009cHVPIC\u00e2\u0080\u009d (aka Hot Vice President in Charge.)
