She pinned some of the blame on President Donald Trump, but said it runs deeper than that. \u201c \u2018I\u2019d be remiss to say that part of this depression is also a result of what we\u2019re seeing in terms of the protests, the continued racial unrest, that has plagued this country since its birth. I have to say that waking up to the news, waking up to how this administration has or has not responded, waking up to yet another story of a Black man or a Black person somehow being dehumanized, or hurt or killed, or falsely accused of something, it is exhausting. And it has led to a weight that I haven\u2019t felt in my life, in a while.\u2019 \u201d That\u2019s Obama explaining her current funk to Michelle Norris, a former NPR host. \u201cThe hypocrisy of it, day in and day out, is dispiriting,\u201d Obama added. She said she deals with the negativity by sticking to a routine, a tool she picked up during her many years navigating the White House spotlight. Still, it\u2019s not easy. \u201cI\u2019m waking up in the middle of the night, \u2019cause I\u2019m worrying about something, or there\u2019s a heaviness,\u201d she said. \u201cI try to make sure I get a workout in, although there have been periods throughout this quarantine, where I just have felt too low... I\u2019ve gone through those emotional highs and lows that I think everybody feels, where you just don\u2019t feel yourself.\u201d Obama, of course, isn\u2019t alone. A recent study by the National Center for Health Statistics found that a third of Americans are showing signs of clinical anxiety and depression during the pandemic. Obama said that family time helps, though her husband and children usually spend the day apart before coming together each evening for dinner and other activities. \u201cPuzzles have become big,\u201d she said. \u201cThe girls are into them. We\u2019re all sitting on the floor around the table where the puzzle is now permanently set up and then we sit down for dinner.\u201d"}]}
