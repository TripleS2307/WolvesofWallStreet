Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn acknowledged in a tweet posted late Monday that his comment that a study had shown plasma achieving a 35% improvement in survival was inaccurate. Hahn made the comment, accompanied by President Donald Trump, while announcing an emergency-use authorization for convalescent plasma. \u201dWhat that means is \u2014 and if the data continue to pan out \u2014 100 people who are sick with COVID-19, 35 would have been saved because of the administration of plasma,\u201d Hahn said at the White House news conference, where Trump described plasma as a \u201cbreakthrough.\u201d Scientists and experts, including the World Health Organization, said Monday that was not correct and noted further clinical research was needed. The FDA commissioner confused absolute risk and relative risk, according to Peter Lurie, a former top FDA official who is president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, the Washington Post reported. \u201cI have been criticized for remarks I made Sunday night about the benefits of convalescent plasma. The criticism is entirely justified,\u201d Hahn wrote. \u201cWhat I should have said better is that the data show a relative risk reduction not an absolute risk reduction.\u201d iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist at the WHO, told reporters at a Monday briefing that, while there are many clinical trials seeking to evaluate the use of blood plasma from patients of the deadly illness who have recovered, only a few have reported results, and those results \u201care not conclusive.\u201d Others were concerned that the FDA is becoming politicized, with the EUA announcement coming on the eve of the Republican National Convention and a day after Trump accused government scientists of slowing research until after the November election. In other news: \u2022 A day after Hong Kong researchers confirmed a case of a patient who had been reinfected with COVID-19, two European patients were reported to have suffered the same fate, the Guardian reported, citing regional public broadcasters in the Netherlands and Belgium. Dutch broadcaster NOS cited virologist Marion Koopmans as describing the Dutch patient as an older person with a weakened immune system, the paper said. The Belgian patient had mild symptoms, according to virologist Marc Van Ranst. \u201cThat someone would pop up with a reinfection, it doesn\u2019t make me nervous,\u201d said Koopmans. \u201cWe have to see whether it happens often.\u201d \u2022 Residents of Gaza are in lockdown after the first cases of COVID-19 were confirmed, raising fears given the densely populated nature of its refugee camps and limited medical facilities, the Guardian reported. Until now, the region has been protected from the virus by its restricted borders. About 2 million people live in Gaza. A Palestinian Authority spokesman said four cases were confirmed in a single family in a refugee camp. \u2022 South Korea is closing schools and resuming remote learning for students in the capital Seoul, after counting 280 new COVID-19 cases on Tuesday, a 12th straight day of more than 100 infections, the New York Times reported. South Korea had won praise for its early handling of the pandemic and success in containing it, but Seoul has been hit by a fresh set of infections, some tracked to schools and others to a church. \u2022 Concerns about a fresh cluster of cases in early hot spot Spain have led Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez to deploy about 2,000 troops to track outbreaks, the Wall Street Journal reported. Infections have started to climb again in many European countries, but Spain\u2019s resurgence has it leading the pack, accounting for about a third of the Continent\u2019s new daily cases. The news is a cautionary tale coming after hard-won progress in reducing the spread, including one of the world\u2019s strictest lockdowns. In early June, new infections had fallen to fewer than 300 a day from a peak in March of nearly 8,000 a day. \u2022 U.S. universities are proving a hotbed for infections and colleges are cracking down on students who fail to socially distance and wear face masks, according to media reports. Ohio State University told 228 students to leave campus pending disciplinary investigations, according to school spokesman Ben Johnson. That was before the resumption of classes. See now: These schools have the largest endowments in the country \u2014 yet they\u2019re still raising tuition during the COVID pandemic At least 531 University of Alabama students, faculty and staff have tested positive for COVID-19 since Aug. 19, the school said Monday. Syracuse University, meanwhile, published a letter on Aug. 1, slamming students for a gathering that is now being investigated: \u201cA large group of first-year students selfishly jeopardized the very thing that so many of you claim to want from Syracuse University \u2014 that is, a chance at a residential college experience. I say this because the students who gathered on the Quad last night may have done damage enough to shut down campus, including residence halls and in-person learning, before the academic semester even begins.\u201dLatest tallies There are now 23.7 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 globally, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University, and at least 814,52 people have died. At least 15.4 million are confirmed to have tested positive and recovered. The U.S. added 40,351 cases on Monday and counted 504 new deaths, according to a New York Times tracker. The U.S. now has 5.76 million confirmed cases and 177,773 deaths, the highest in the world by a wide margin. Brazil is second with 3.6 million cases and 115,309 deaths. India is third as measured by cases at 3.2 million, followed by Russia with 963,655 and South Africa with 611,450. Mexico has had 563,705 cases and 60,800 deaths, the third highest in the world. India now has 58,390 deaths, putting it ahead of the U.K. That country has 328,620 cases and 41,519 fatalities, the highest in Europe and fifth highest in the world. China, where the illness was first reported late last year, has 89,718 cases, and 4,711 fatalitiesWhat\u2019s the economy saying? Consumer confidence fell in August to a new pandemic low after a fresh rash of coronavirus cases during the summer caused Americans to turn more pessimistic about an economic recovery, according to a closely followed survey, MarketWatch\u2019s Jeffry Bartash reported. The index of consumer confidence sank to 84.8 this month from a revised 91.7 in July, the Conference Board said Tuesday. Economists polled by MarketWatch had expected a reading of 93. The surprising decline in the index of consumer confidence index, however, was contradicted by a pair of other surveys. See:What could save the hotel industry amid the pandemic \u2014 a hub for work and play The consumer-sentiment index produced by the University of Michigan edged up slightly in August \u2014 though it was still quite low \u2014 while a daily tracker at Morning Consult has been creeping higher in the past two weeks. The level of confidence had risen in May and June after states reopened their economies, but it had faltered again in July after a fresh rash of coronavirus cases. It remains to be seen if confidence starts to rise again with case loads receding. \u201cConsumer spending has rebounded in recent months, but increasing concerns among consumers about the economic outlook and their financial well-being will likely cause spending to cool in the months ahead,\u201d said Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at the board. A separate report found sales of new single-family homes increased markedly for a third month in a row, rising to their highest level since 2006, as MarketWatch\u2019s Jacob Passy reported. Sales of new single-family houses rose 14% between June and July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 901,000, the U.S. Census Bureau reported Tuesday. Compared with a year ago, new-home sales were up 36%. Economists polled by MarketWatch had expected a median pace of new-home sales of 790,000. The government also revised June\u2019s new home sales figure to a rate of 791,000, up from 776,000. The report\u2019s small sample size has historically led to significant revisions. Read:Nouriel Roubini says reports of the dollar\u2019s demise are greatly exaggerated \u201cBuilders are already having trouble keeping pace with demand, and materials costs are rising rapidly, which will add to upward pressure on new home prices, meaning affordability will be more sensitive to any given increase in mortgage interest rates,\u201d Richard Moody, chief economist at Regions Financial Corp., wrote in a research note. \u201cAnd, with the labor market still in a state of ill repair, it is reasonable to question how long the strength in demand seen over the past few months can be sustained, even absent a meaningful increase in mortgage interest rates.\u201dWhat are companies saying? \u2022 Best Buy Co. Inc. BBY, +1.45% reported a second-quarter earnings and revenue beat, though it offered a cautious outlook.

HRL, -0.28%, the parent of food brands including Skippy peanut butter, Spam and Applegate, posted better-than-expected earnings for its third fiscal quarter. Chief Executive Jim Snee said the company saw strength across its retail and deli businesses, along with a rebound in its food-service business. \u201cWe expect the fourth quarter to mirror many of the dynamics we saw in the third quarter,\u201d Snee said. \u201cHowever, the magnitude of additional recovery in the food-service industry, the performance of the entire food supply chain and the state of the broader economy remain highly uncertain\u201d due to the pandemic. The company absorbed about $40 million in supply-chain costs related to lower production volumes, employee bonuses and enhanced safety measures at its production facilities. \u201cOn a year-to-date basis, total incremental costs were $60 million, and the range of incremental costs in the fourth quarter is $20 [million to] $40 million. The total incremental supply-chain costs are anticipated to be $80-$100 million in fiscal 2020,\u201d it said in a statement. \u2022 J.M. Smucker Co. SJM, +1.32% posted better-than-expected earnings for its fiscal first quarter, as the parent of brands including Folgers, Smuckers and Caf\u00e9 Bustelo got a boost from demand for coffee and consumer foods. \u201cWe expect continued momentum in the second quarter, and are pleased to raise our full-year guidance,\u201d Chief Executive Mark Smucker said in a statement. The company is now expecting full-year sales to be flat to up 1%, versus prior guidance for a decline of 2% to 1%.
