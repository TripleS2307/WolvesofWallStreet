But with the Fed pursuing thunderous asset purchases and getting ever softer on its 2% inflation target, the bubble is firmly on track to be one of biggest in stock market history.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Andrew Parlin, founder and chief investment officer of investment advisory Washington Peak, joining the growing chorus of bearish pundits in a recent op-ed for the Financial Times. The piece caught the attention of Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale economist\u00c2 Albert Edwards, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been known to offer up some rather gloomy market takes of his own: iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } As an investor who navigated the historic bubble in Japan decades ago, Parlin said that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperiencing d\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3 vu\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the current top-heavy climate. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBack then, anything with a whiff of exposure to real estate was at the centre of speculation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he explained. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, the hottest sectors in America are nearly all disruptive technologies. Stocks with real, or perceived, exposure to the cloud, digital payments, electric vehicles, plant-based food, or anything at all to do with the stay-at-home economy have shot up meteorically.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As Parlin sees it, stories surrounding \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe hottest disrupters,\u00e2\u0080\u009d are every bit as unrealistic as the nonsensical real-estate investments of Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mania. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBubbles are formed around individual stocks and sectors. As the concentric circles of excess widen, more and more stocks are infected,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWildly exaggerated stock stories force a delinking between fundamental analysis and share prices.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2 He said Tesla TSLA, +1.89% is an example of \u00e2\u0080\u009cthese pods of excess\u00e2\u0080\u009d that will ultimately have a destabilizing effect on the broader market. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust as soaring price-to-book ratios signaled massive speculative risk in Japan in the late 1980s, where assets were all the rage, so today in the U.S. insanely high price-to-sales ratios highlight the total lack of realism embedded in the hottest growth stocks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Parlin wrote. \u00c2 This metric, he explained, tends to be fairly stable, and it is rare to see a stock trading at a price-to-sales ratio over 10 times. But that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most definitely not the case these days. According to Bloomberg data cited in the op-ed, 530 out of 8,513 listed common stocks in the U.S. trade at more than 10 times sales. Parlin pointed out that only once in history have we seen a larger percentage of stocks trading in excess of 10 times sales. When was that? You guessed it: March of 2000. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe point is that price-to-sales ratios in the stratosphere do not stay there, any more than a tulip bulb in 17th-century Holland was able to maintain a price of $100,000,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis gets at the troubling thing about bubbles. They do not simply undergo smooth and endogenous shrinkage until they disappear. Instead, they continue to expand until they burst. This is why their bursting is more often than not shocking, spectacular and disorderly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00c2 Tuesday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decline may not be \u00e2\u0080\u009cshocking\u00e2\u0080\u009d but the major indexes, at last check, were firmly in the red. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% was down more than 400 points, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% and Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39% were hit even harder on a percentage basis. As for Tesla, the stock was taking a beating, down about 14%."}]}
