Walmart Inc. is trying to get a jump on holiday shopping, as it unveiled Thursday its list of what it believes will be the \"hottest toys\" this year. The unveiling comes as industry experts have suggested consumers may spend less during the holidays this year, but are also likely to get started a lot earlier, given uncertainties over how the COVID-19 pandemic will play out in the coming months.

With families spending more time at home amid the pandemic, this year's list reflects a focus on trends including educational toys and those that help kids burn energy outside. \"More than any year before, we're seeing strong interest across toys that stem from digital platforms, like kid influencer-created toys, interactive and educational toys, screen-free indoor entertainment and toys for active outdoor play,\" said Steve Ronchetto, the retail giant's vice president of toys. Walmart's stock WMT, +1.00%  , which fell 2.3% in afternoon trading Thursday, has rallied 21% so far this year, while the SPDR S&P Retail exchange-traded fund XRT, +0.05%  has advanced 12% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56%  has slipped 1.2%. Walmart also announced Thursday the launch of Walmart Wonder Lab, which allows consumers to virtually \"unbox,\" test and play with toys. The list of 36 toys, of which 13 will be sold exclusively at Walmart stores, was compiled by what the retailer said are the \"real experts, kids.\" They are ranked within six different categories: From the TV to the toy room Toy Price Frozen 2 - Magic in Motion Elsa Doll $59.00 Blue's Clues & You Peek-A-Boo $24.84 Paw Patrol Dino Patroller $59.00 The Child Bop It* $14.88 LEGO Death Star Final Duel* $89.00 Star Wars Dark Saber $29.84 Walmart (*Walmart exclusive) High-tech gadgets Toy Price Sensory FX ASMR Mega Bar* $19.88 VTech KidiZoom Creator Cam $59.00 Instax Mini 7S Seafoam Green* $59.00 onn. 8\" Tablet Pro* $99.00 Walmart (*Walmart exclusive) Interactive Play Toy Price Disney Princess Vanity $49.88 Gotta Go Flamingo $28.82 FurReal Mama Josie Kangaroo Pet $67.00 Squeakee $58.00 My Life As Hello Kitty Dolls* $35.00 Barbie Farm Barn Playset* $74.00 L.O.L Surprise OMG Remix Dolls $34.88 (available mid-September) Walmart (*Walmart exclusive) Surprise Toys Toy Price The Animal $34.88 (available Oct. 1) Treasure X - Sharks Treasure $19.87 Hatchimals Crystal Flyers $29.77 Na!
