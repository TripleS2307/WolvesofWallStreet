And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen this play out before. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe most expensive firms in the market today, like in August of 2000, generate no FCF, are loss-making and carry the associated negative ROEs and ROAs, and are diluting shareholders to fund operations,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kailish wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith spreads between value and growth at record levels and an explosion of speculative listings through IPOs and SPACs underway, today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s market environment shares numerous features with prior peaks in 2000 and 2007.\u00e2\u0080\u009d No sign of a popping bubble as stocks got a bit more expensive to start the week and held gains on Tuesday. At last check, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% \u00c2 , Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39% and S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% were all hovering around breakeven."}]}
