The influential Cook Political Report has changed its rating for a Senate race in Montana, where Republican incumbent Steve Daines faces Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock, to \u00e2\u0080\u009cToss Up\u00e2\u0080\u009d from \u00e2\u0080\u009cLean Republican.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It also recently has switched one of Georgia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Senate contests, where GOP incumbent David Perdue is running against Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff, to \u00e2\u0080\u009cLean Republican\u00e2\u0080\u009d from \u00e2\u0080\u009cLikely Republican,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as well as adjusted its rating for an Alaska race, where GOP incumbent Dan Sullivan faces challenger Al Gross, to \u00e2\u0080\u009cLikely Republican\u00e2\u0080\u009d from \u00e2\u0080\u009cSolid Republican.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gross is running as an independent \u00e2\u0080\u009cwith the blessing of national Democrats,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to Cook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s analysis. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMoreover, recent polling data suggests vulnerability for Republicans in AZ, CO, and IA,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Height analysts said. GOP Sen. Martha McSally of Arizona is being challenged by Democrat Mark Kelly, while Republican Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado is expected to face off against former Democratic Gov. Jon Hickenlooper, though Hickenlooper still must defeat rival Andrew Romanoff in a June 30 primary. In Iowa, GOP Sen. Joni Ernst is running against Democrat Theresa Greenfield.

The most affected areas in the energy sector would be \u00e2\u0080\u009crenewable energy tax credits and oil industry tax cuts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and in financial services, the \u00e2\u0080\u009crisk comes from Biden nominees for regulatory bodies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Read more:Biden unveils plan that would add a public option to Obamacare The Height team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s views have some similarities with a take last month from analysts at Capital Alpha Partners, who said they see increasing chances for Democrats to take the White House and the Senate while maintaining control of the House of Representatives. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCapital Alpha now flips to predict 55% odds of a Democratic White House and Senate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the analysts wrote in a May note.
