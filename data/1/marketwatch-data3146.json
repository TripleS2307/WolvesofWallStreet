Powell noted that households and the jobs market have slightly improved since May as the nation made headway against the biggest shock to the U.S. economy \u201cin living memory,\u201d but also warned that rising coronavirus cases in many states now threaten the pace of the recovery. \u201cFiscal policy is essential here,\u201d Powell said in an afternoon news conference, where he reiterated that the Fed had no plans to rein in its slate of emergency lending facilities to keep credit flowing, and also nudged members of Congress to provide additional coronavirus aid. \u201cI think they are playing with fire,\u201d Diane Jaffee, a senior portfolio manager at TCW, said about the protracted debate in Congress over further pandemic aid, in an interview following the Fed\u2019s decision. \u201cIf Congress was counting on the fact that the economy was going to reopen, and they wouldn\u2019t need to do another package, clearly, that Plan A is gone.\u201d Investors hope Republicans, Democrats and the White House can agree on additional coronavirus aid ahead of the end-of-the-month expiration of supplemental unemployment benefits that have been credited with helping cushion the economic blow from the pandemic.
