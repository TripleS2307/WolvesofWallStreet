Publishers have announced that certain games for Microsoft Corp.\u2019s MSFT new Xbox and Sony Corp.\u2019s SNE JP:6758 new PlayStation will reach a $70 price point. Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. TTWO caused a stir in the gaming world over the summer when it announced that its annual basketball game, \u201cNBA 2K21,\u201d would cost $69.99 for next-generation consoles, and recent Sony announcements included two games priced at that level. Top-of-the-line videogame titles have remained at a $60 price point since 2005, when game developers started hiking prices from a standard $50 to follow Activision, which pushed the cost for \u201cCall of Duty 2,\u201d to $59.99, according to NPD Group analyst Mat Piscatella. Adjusted for inflation, $60 in 2005 would have the same buying power as $78.29 today, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \u201cWe believe our suggested retail price for NBA 2K21 on next-generation platforms fairly represents the value of what\u2019s being offered: power, speed and technology that is only possible on new hardware,\u201d Take-Two spokesman Alan Lewis told MarketWatch in an email. From Barron\u2019s: Videogame Stocks Have Soared for 20 Years. They\u2019re About to Get Another Boost Activision Blizzard Inc. ATVI told MarketWatch it had no announcements on future games but confirmed that \u201cCall of Duty: Black Ops Cold War\u201d would retail in the U.S. at $70. When asked if Electronic Arts Inc. EA intended to release $70 games, a spokesman would only say that customers who buy \u201cFIFA 21\u201d or \u201cMadden NFL 21\u201d for $59.99 on the current PlayStation or Xbox will be able to upgrade their game for the new consoles at no additional cost. Barclays analyst Mario Lu expects the other publishers to move higher for premium games after Sony listed $69.99 prices last month for two games exclusive to the PlayStation 5, \u201cDemon\u2019s Souls\u201d from Bluepoint Games and \u201cDestruction All Stars\u201d from Lucid Games. \u201cWe think this could mark the tipping point for next-gen games pricing as we think many developers will now be more inclined to follow suit after seeing Sony pricing its own first-party titles at launch at $70,\u201d Lu said. The 2005 increase to $60 from $50 did little to slow down rapid growth in videogame sales, and the COVID-19 pandemic has increased videogame play even more. Piscatella, though, pointed out that the industry has since diversified to offer more games as part of subscriptions or as free-to-play games that monetize through in-game purchases. \u201cWhen it comes to what\u2019s different now, well, not much and everything,\u201d NPD\u2019s Piscatella told MarketWatch. \u201cNot much in that the same trepidation that exists now about some next generation titles releasing at $69.99 also occurred prior to the launch of \u2018Call of Duty 2,\u2019 \u2026 [but] the range of games and services available makes it a much more competitive marketplace today than it was way back when.\u201d Piscatella noted that many games have higher-priced \u201cPremium\u201d or \u201cCollector\u2019s\u201d editions that are often priced as much as $40 higher than the basic game, and that the number of gamers willing to pay that much has been growing, especially for high-profile titles. He also expects many games to avoid going for that higher price, though, saying $69.99 will not become \u201ca de facto standard across all releases on the next-generation consoles.\u201d \u201cThere are so many ways games can be monetized now, and no one way of pricing or selling a title will work for everyone,\u201d he said. The videogame industry has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the coronavirus pandemic, as gamers play with friends online from the safety of their homes. Videogame sales in the U.S. are expected to come in around $45.6 billion this year, out of an estimated $200.3 billion world-wide, according to Lewis Ward, IDC research director of gaming. Worldwide, that\u2019s a growth rate of 21.3%, with $22 billion more in sales than in earlier forecasts. For more: Videogames are flourishing in the pandemic, and game makers aren\u2019t scared of the future Sony\u2019s release of the PlayStation 5 is scheduled for Nov. 12, seven years after it released the PS4. Also seven years after its last major iteration, Microsoft\u2019s release of the Xbox Series X is slated for Nov. 10. An update to Nintendo\u2019s JP:7974 NTDOY Switch console, which first came out in 2017, has no official release date but is expected to arrive sometime in 2021. Piper Sandler surveyed 9,800 teenagers this summer and found that they are growing more eager to buy new consoles and continue paying upfront for games despite free-to-play options. Analyst Yung Kim reported that 63% of teens intended to buy a next-gen console, up from 59% in the spring, and 44% said that free-to-play games would not discourage them from buying games, up from 40% in the spring. Activision\u2019s \u201cCall of Duty\u201d was the most cited title, with 42% of teens saying they were \u201cexcited\u201d to buy it this year. Kim has overweight ratings on Activision, EA and Take-Two. Jefferies analyst Alex Giaimo expects the current momentum behind videogames will result in faster refresh rates for new consoles compared with previous releases, and of course more profit. \u201cThis is important in the context of full-game price hikes, as we estimate that a 10MM unit seller would contribute an incremental $56MM in net income at a $70 price point as compared to $60,\u201d Giaimo said.

Barclays\u2019 Lu expects the shift to $70 games will boost earnings-per-share to Take-Two and EA by double-digit percentages in fiscal 2022, and boost Activision\u2019s EPS by 6% in fiscal 2021. For the year, shares of Activision are up 31%, EA is up 17%, and Take-Two has gained 31%. In comparison, the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% is up 7% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.39% is up 27%."}]}
