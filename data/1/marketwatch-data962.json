COVID-19 exacerbates everything. Ask Shweta Khare, Jackie Casiano and Myriam Simpierre, entrepreneurs behind an Upper West Side cafe, West Village hair salon and Bedford-Stuyvesant grocery, respectively, which all opened their doors during the pandemic. They\u2019re making space for guarded optimism as well as setbacks, and recognizing that a key to survival is being able to pivot to a Plan B or C. \u201cThe most important lesson of COVID-19 is learning to adapt,\u201d Simpierre said. \u201cDistribution channels go awry. Prices change. A pandemic happens. Anything can happen. You have to be adaptable.\u201d Myriam Simpierre opened Buy Better Foods in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn in April. Hers was deemed an essential business. Aimee Simpierre Other New Yorkers have learned the same lesson. Partnership for New York City, a business-industry trade group, reviewed public government data and found that 495 new appearance-enhancement businesses \u2014 the category covers cosmetology, esthetics, nail specialty, natural hair styling and waxing services \u2014 and barber shop licenses were issued in the city in 2020 between March 15 and Sept. 10. That figure is down 45% from 2019 for the same period. There isn\u2019t enough useful or current public data on new grocers or cafes to see figures on those categories, according to Partnership communications director Natasha Avanessians. But amid a rising toll of closures \u2014 Partnership for New York has estimated that a third of the city\u2019s 230,000 small businesses may not reopen due to the virus \u2014 newcomers are rays of hope amid the ruins and rubble of the COVID-scorched business landscape.

The 400-square-foot shop is named for a street in Melbourne lined with small shops. She has one full-time employee and three part-timers. \u201cThe city can feel lonely, especially now,\u201d said Khare, who came to New York from London in 2014 and earned a master\u2019s degree in Organizational Psychology at Columbia University. \u201cPeople crave a sense of connection. It sounds clich\u00e9, but being a place that provides connection is very satisfying. It was my dream to create a space with a sense of community.\u201d Khare, who lives in the neighborhood with her husband, an economist, and their 17-month-old daughter, spent 2018 looking for a suitable location for her business. She finalized negotiations on a 10-year lease in January. Two months later, as she prepared to open, the virus hit. Khare considered walking away from the enterprise, concerned about being able to run it responsibly and safely. \u201cAs the weeks and months progressed,\u201d she said, \u201cI could see in some ways that the city was learning to live with the virus.\u201d Also see: Powell says it\u2019s tough for Fed to boost lending to smaller businesses She\u2019s learned the value of a landlord willing to negotiate. Hers, Schreiber Properties, which owns three adjacent buildings on West 96th Street in Manhattan, was such a landlord. \u201cThere was some negotiating, including a 10% reduction and free months,\u201d Sam Schreiber says. Khare anticipates breaking even for the first month, but she\u2019s not paying herself a salary. \u201cBusiness is steady,\u201d she says, adding that overhearing a customer say she walked 20 blocks just for her coffee, hit home. \u201cThat feels like a success.\u201d Couture Cutz, a hair salon at 242 W. 10th St. in Manhattan\u2019s West Village, marks Jackie Casiano\u2019s first business venture in New York City. \u201cThirty years ago I had a restaurant in Pennsylvania,\u201d said Casiano, 57, who signed a five-year lease on a shop on a leafy stretch that\u2019s also home to Housing Works and a police station. While driving around the city in May, Casiano saw a For Rent sign in the shop window. Rent negotiations took a month and a half. \u201cFinally, he said, \u2018Tell me what is comfortable for you,\u2019\u201d Casiano recalls. \u201cMy son, Edwin, cuts and colors hair,\u201d she said. \u201cHe has a talent in his hands.\u201d The eldest of her five kids, he brings a clientele from years of cutting and styling at Astor Place, she adds. Digging into savings, Casiano spent about $4,000 to construct the space for two stylists and two barbers. Opening day was July 15. \u201cThe first three weeks were \u2018oh my God\u2019 busy,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople were so ready to have their hair professionally done.\u201d Like a rapidly receding hairline, traffic thinned dramatically in August, a time when New Yorkers always flee the heat. \u201cI didn\u2019t see the walk-ins. It was scary.\u201d Business has picked up in September. Casiano, who\u2019s not drawing a salary yet, says she is there seven days a week. She sweeps the sidewalk and puts out bowls of water for neighborhood dogs. \u201cI talk to everybody,\u201d she said. \u201cThe neighborhood has embraced us. I hope and pray it works out.\u201d Simpierre, 46, who was born in Haiti and grew up in the U.S., spent five years planning for her small business. \u201cMy goal has always been to open a market to cater to the needs of the community and to show that healthy food is accessible,\u201d she said. Also see: It ain\u2019t over! It\u2019s New York! Buy Better Foods, her market for organic groceries, bulk foods and herbs, and supplements at 372 Kosciuszko St. in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, opened in April \u2014 about nine months after signing a 10-year-lease. \u201cI was supposed to open in March, but I delayed it a month.\u201d She was deemed an essential business. Between July 2019 to March 2020, Simpierre, whose studies at Baruch College included entrepreneurship, created her 900-square-foot space. \u201cStores tend to be cluttered,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is an open space where you can see clearly.\u201d An SBA loan helped her realize her vision. Her rent, one of the two biggest expenses along with inventory, \u201cis decent. Everything is about negotiations,\u201d she said. Early on it was difficult for her to get products that went to larger stores first. \u201cI felt the severity quickly,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause I was new and unknown there were delays. Having good relationships with distributors and local vendors is invaluable.\u201d Also see: Trump\u2019s trade policy failed the workers he promised to help Simpierre, who has two part-time staffers, sped up plans to introduce third-party shopping. \u201cI had to introduce online ordering for Mercato.com,\u201d she said. It was not in the plan in the beginning. I had to do that quickly to increase business.\u201d Five months after opening, Simpierre has been able to draw salary. \u201cI\u2019m married. I have a wife and two children,\u201d she said, adding that every entrepreneur\u2019s situation is unique. On Sept. 10, a store window was broken and the shop was burglarized. A GoFundMe campaign launched then to raise $3,500 to replace the glass and install security gates has exceeded its goal. \u201cWe plan to recover quickly and come back stronger,\u201d Simpierre notes at the fund site. \u201cIt\u2019s week by week,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic because of the support.\u201d"}]}
