I mean, we\u2019re just not.\u201d \u201d \u2014 Dr. Anthony Fauci, to FiveThirtyEight.com In separate interviews Thursday, the nation\u2019s top infectious-disease specialist said that the coronavirus pandemic is every public-health official\u2019s \u201cworst nightmare,\u201d but stepped back from comments he made the day before. \u201cRather than think in terms of reverting back down to a complete shutdown, I would think we need to get the states pausing in their opening process,\u201d Fauci said at an event hosted by The Hill. \u201cI would think we need to get the states pausing in their opening process, looking at what did not work well and try to mitigate that . . . I don\u2019t think we need to go back to an extreme of shutting down.\u201d \u201cI would hope we don\u2019t have to resort to shutdown,\u201d he said. On Wednesday, Fauci told a Wall Street Journal podcast that states experiencing serious problems with new infections \u201cshould seriously look at shutting down,\u201d a position contrary to President Donald Trump\u2019s desire to quickly reopen the country. At Thursday\u2019s event, Fauci said problem states, such as California, Florida, Texas and Arizona, can likely get a handle on the spread of the virus through more limited measures, such as closing bars, banning large gatherings and urging face masks, social distancing and hand-washing. \u201cIf we can do that consistently, I would tell you almost certainly you\u2019re going to see a downturn in those infections,\u201d he said. Separately, in an interview Thursday with FiveThirtyEight\u2019s PODCAST-19, Fauci said that compared to other parts of the world, the U.S. is not doing well. \u201cAs a country, when you compare us to other countries, I don\u2019t think you can say we\u2019re doing great. I mean, we\u2019re just not,\u201d he said. He added that partisanship has made the fight against coronavirus tougher. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t have unanimity in an approach to something, you\u2019re not as effective in how you handle it,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I think you\u2019d have to make the assumption that if there wasn\u2019t such divisiveness, that we would have a more coordinated approach.\u201d"}]}
