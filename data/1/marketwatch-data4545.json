After waiting 100 days for the richest soccer league in the world to return, fans were treated to a 0-0 draw between Aston Villa and Sheffield United in the first game back. However, Sheffield United were denied a clear goal despite the ball crossing the line. Technology company Hawk-Eye later apologized after none of the seven cameras focused on the goal picked it up as players and the goalposts blocked the view. Manchester City then beat Arsenal 3-0 in the second game of the evening. Arsenal defender David Luiz had a night to forget as his error led to the first goal and then he was sent off in giving away a penalty for City's second. The first full round of fixtures will kick off on Friday. U.K. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said that the return would represent a boost for \"a football-loving nation\" and that Wednesday's games would be broadcast in all but five countries around the world. Dowden added that he hoped some fans may be able to return to stadiums for matches by the beginning of next season. The new normal will see the matches played in front of empty stadiums with television viewers given the option of fake crowd noise. A minute's silence will be held before the first matches in memory of those lost to the coronavirus pandemic, while NHS frontline health staff will be honored through a badge on the players' shirts. The names on the back of the shirts will also be replaced by \"Black Lives Matter\" for the first 12 matches, following the death of George Floyd and worldwide protests that have resulted. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } All 92 remaining fixtures will be broadcast live in the U.K. by the league's broadcast partners Sky Sports, BT Sport BT.A, +0.51%, BBC Sport and Amazon Prime AMZN, +3.01%, as well as by broadcasters around the world insluding Comcast's CMCSA, -0.99%  NBC properties in the U.S. As part of the extensive preparations to bring football back, players and staff have been tested twice weekly over the past month as clubs returned to training.
