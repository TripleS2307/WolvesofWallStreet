But when he said \u201cif we stop testing right now we\u2019d have very few cases\u201d of coronavirus, he may have written a new line of attack for critics who question his commitment to following the science. His statement overlooks other important measures of the ongoing coronavirus threat, including hospitalizations and deaths. Trump\u2019s comment Monday was part of a broader administration effort to play down the pandemic, a push that public health experts and Democratic officials worry is sending a dangerous message to the American public as some parts of the country have seen a surge in cases in recent weeks. \u201cAn ostrich puts his head in the sand because he doesn\u2019t want to see what\u2019s around him,\u201d said Lawrence Gostin, a public health expert at Georgetown University. \u201cIt\u2019s the same thing with Trump.\u201d Last week, the University of Washington\u2019s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation published new projections that show COVID-19-related deaths in the U.S. could surpass 200,000 by Oct. 1. The institute said rising rates of infections, hospitalizations and death \u201care now occurring in the wake of eased or ended distancing policies.\u201d Trump offered more rosy talk Tuesday, predicting that a vaccine would be available by year\u2019s end and adding that \u201ceven without it, it goes away.\u201d He offered that optimistic outlook just one day after he attributed surging positive cases to testing in the United States that is \u201cso much bigger and more advanced than any other country.\u201d Read: \u2018We\u2019re still in a first wave,\u2019 Fauci says, noting precautions can prevent second wave of coronavirus Vice President Mike Pence, for his part, pushed back in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that the potential for a second wave of the virus was \u201coverblown.\u2019 \u201cLess than 2 percent of the counties in the entire country are seeing any significant increase in cases,\u201d Pence said in a separate Fox News interview. \u201cThat\u2019s a tribute to the American people.\u201d But public health experts say Trump and Pence\u2019s ebullience papers over concerning data that suggests that the virus remains a serious threat to Americans\u2019 health and the economy and that the slowing of social distancing and mitigation efforts risks a second wave of the coronavirus in the fall. Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic minority leader, criticized the vice president for ridiculing concerns about a second wave. \u201cDr. Pence would not be someone I\u2019d go to for a medical checkup, or for medical advice,\u201d he said. The Trump administration\u2019s push to diminish concerns about the virus comes as the president looks to resume his reelection campaign in earnest. Trump has seen his support erode over his handling of the pandemic and nationwide protests following the killing of George Floyd, the African American Minneapolis man who died after a white policeman pressed his knee onto Floyd\u2019s neck. In recent weeks, leading public health experts on the White House coronavirus task force have made less frequent public appearances as the White House has sought to focus on the economic recovery from the pandemic. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government\u2019s top epidemiologist, said in an interview on NPR\u2019s \u201c1A\u201d that he last spoke to Trump about two weeks ago. The coronavirus task force coordinator, Deborah Birx, hasn\u2019t given a major media interview since late May. Trump is set to hold his first campaign rally since early March on Saturday in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Ticketholders were required to acknowledge the risk of exposure to coronavirus and absolve the campaign of liability if they fall ill. Trump also has moved his August nomination acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention to Jacksonville, Florida, after North Carolina\u2019s Democratic governor said he couldn\u2019t assure that the convention could go on as planned in Charlotte without some social distancing measures. \u201cHe continues to put politics over public health,\u201d Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez said of Trump. Pence pointed to data showing more than half of states are actually seeing cases decline or remain stable. In the six states that have been recording 1,000 new cases a day, increased testing has allowed public health officials to determine that most of the outbreaks are occurring in particular settings \u2014 prisons, nursing homes and meatpacking facilities. But experts say testing is identifying just a small fraction of the actual number of infections in this country. In the last several weeks, new cases have decreased in the Northeast and much of the Midwest, while increasing in several states in the South and West. In the past week, hospitalization rates have increased in 11 states in the South and West, according to The COVID Tracking Project, a volunteer organization that collects coronavirus data in the United States. The states are Alaska, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Kentucky, Mississippi, Montana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Utah. Several of those states have also seen recent increases in the seven-day rolling average on the percent of tests coming back positive, another worrying sign. The reason for the increases can vary. In Arkansas, health officials say it\u2019s specific to a few counties and seems to be largely driven by localized outbreaks related to poultry processing plants. But in Arizona and some other states, the increases are more widespread and suggest community spread that seems to have erupted after the states lifted stay-at-home orders, school and business closures, and other restrictions that were put in place during the spring to stop outbreaks from ever taking off. Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego said Arizona residents are hearing \u201cmixed messages\u201d from Trump and Pence as well as Arizona\u2019s Republican governor, Doug Ducey, about how careful they need to be. Arizona was among the first to lift its stay-at-home order last month, quickly allowing restaurants, barbershops and even nightclubs to reopen. Ducey has declined to require residents wear masks in public spaces where social distancing is difficult. The state reported 2,392 new coronavirus cases Tuesday, a new daily high, and 25 additional deaths. \u201cWe are still very much climbing towards our peak,\u201d Gallego said. \u201cThe problem is getting worse in Arizona.\u201d"}]}
