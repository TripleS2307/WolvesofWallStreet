The company said it expects second-quarter revenue and total system capacity to be off by 90% and 75%, respectively, from a year earlier. American Airlines has cut $13.5 billion from its operating and capital budgets for the year through \"significant cost reduction actions\" around marketing, maintenance, events, training, airport facilities, and other areas. The company said it has \"passed the peak in cash refund activity\" as flight demand has started to improve. That's helped American Airlines' cash burn rate improve to an estimated $40 million a day for the month of June, from a peak of more than $100 million a day during April. The company is hoping to reduce its cash-burn rate to about zero by the end of the year \"as expected demand conditions continue to improve and its cost initiatives continue to gain traction.\" American Airlines said earlier this month that it is planning to fly 55% of its domestic schedule and about 20% of its international schedule in July. Its July system-wide capacity would represent about 40% of July 2019 flying. American Airlines shares have fallen 50% so far this year as the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% has declined 7%."}]}
