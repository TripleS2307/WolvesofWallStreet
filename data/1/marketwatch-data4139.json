That is significantly higher than the roughly 796,000 tests conducted on July 22, according to the COVID Tracking Project, and experts at Harvard University have consistently said the U.S. is falling short of testing targets during the pandemic. Officials at the National Institutes of Health said Wednesday that Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics program, which was established in April with $1.5 billion in stimulus funding, will focus on encouraging the development of point-of-care tests, in part by providing financial assistance to developers, and examining the role of home-based tests, biomarkers to identify an infection with the virus, and testing wastewater to understand the prevalence of the virus in a community. The Food and Drug Administration so far has granted emergency use authorization to 154 diagnostic tests, 31 antibody tests, and two antigen tests during the pandemic."}]}
