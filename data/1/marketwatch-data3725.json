The 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.777% rose 0.8 basis point to 0.704%, while the 2-year note rate TMUBMUSD02Y, 0.156% was up 0.6 basis point to 0.192%. The 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, 1.576% fell 0.8 basis point to 1.461%. Bond prices move inversely to yields.What\u2019s driving Treasurys? The World Health Organization reported around 180,000 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, the single-largest increase since the pandemic began, with two thirds of new cases coming from the Americas. Around half of the 50 U.S. states were also reporting a rise in new coronavirus cases, threatening to undo the months of progress made through harsh lockdown measures used to stem the coronavirus\u2019 spread. The worrisome developments on the medical front helped to keep the 10-year note yield anchored near 0.70%, even as risk assets gained on Monday, a move that would usually weigh on haven assets like government bonds.

Historically the summer months are characterized by limited conviction and low volumes, the COVID-19 outbreak challenges this typical pattern and we\u2019ll be curious to learn just how closely the mid-year point conforms to prior episodes,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets."}]}
