Some clients fear losing everything they\u2019ve built. For some, the threat of bankruptcy is a reality, while for others, even the remote possibility of going broke stirs feelings of dread. Advisers face a tricky challenge in aiding these anxious clients. On one hand, they have a responsibility to prepare individuals for the worst \u2014 and devise a plan if the money runs out. But in their effort to assist clients in desperate financial straits, they risk coming on too strong. Facing the likelihood of losing it all can prove immobilizing. Rushing to draft a detailed strategy and offer technical advice will backfire if a client isn\u2019t ready to listen. First, an adviser needs to show concern and gather information. \u201cMaybe the client is treading water with their anxiety,\u201d said Meghaan Lurtz, a senior research associate at Kitces.com, which provides education and resources for financial planners. \u201cPart of an adviser\u2019s job is to be there while they tread\u201d and serve as a sounding board. Advisers who set a supportive tone are better positioned to help clients grapple with their fear. Responding to anxiety with non-judgmental acceptance is a good first step. \u201cIt may be exhausting and stressful for advisers to deal with these clients,\u201d Lurtz said. \u201cBut you still need to thank them for opening up to you. That makes them feel safe.\u201d The next step is to try to learn more. To someone scared of losing their business, for example, say: \u201cTell me how things for you are going.\u201d \u201cGet to the heart of what the client is experiencing and what\u2019s at the heart of their fear,\u201d Lurtz said. \u201cIt may be they\u2019re nervous about losing key employees to the virus or how long they can continue to pay them. Or it may be a decline in revenues and their P&L [profit and loss]. It may be about something else.\u201d She urges advisers to make statements (\u201cTell me more about that\u201d) rather than pose questions. That\u2019s because clients are more apt to lower their guard and speak freely when responding to a neutrally worded prompt. \u201cWhen we hear a question, our brain thinks there\u2019s a right and wrong answer,\u201d she said. \u201cBut people respond very differently to a statement. It cues the client that you really want to know, and solicits a richer type of response.\u201d Advisers tend to draw conclusions from data analysis. If they think a client\u2019s fear of losing it all is unfounded, they may trot out facts and figures as reassurance. Yet appealing to rationality when someone is not thinking clearly \u2014 and riddled with fear \u2014 carries risk. \u201cWhether the fear is rational or irrational, it\u2019s real in the client\u2019s mind,\u201d said Kim Bourne, a New York City-based certified financial planner. \u201cSo you have to get to the root cause, whatever is underlying that fear.\u201d She cites the example of a client, a pre-retiree in his 60s, who feared a financial wipeout as the market tanked in mid-March. In reality, he held significant assets and faced no danger of bankruptcy. \u201cHe had the experience of poverty in his past, so he was afraid,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fear of losing everything was lingering in his head.\u201d Bourne dignified his fear. Instead of trying to appeal to his rational side by crunching the numbers, she sought to learn more about his feelings. \u201cTell me more about what it felt like when you didn\u2019t have enough money,\u201d she said. Then she asked, \u201cWhat did you learn from those dark moments?\u201d Then she asked: \u201cHow did that help you achieve your greatest financial accomplishments?\u201d He came away with a restored sense of perspective, Bourne says, and his fear no longer plagues him as much.
