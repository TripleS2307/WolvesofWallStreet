See:Coronavirus update: COVID-19 is far from contained and could rival 1918 flu pandemic that killed 50 million, experts warn \"Workers serving customers should not have to make a critical decision as to whether they should risk exposure to infection or lose their jobs because a minority of people refuse to wear masks in order to help stop the spread of the deadly coronavirus.\" The NRF also included a reminder that retailers are \"private businesses\" that can adopt legal policies to protect their associates and shoppers. \"Shopping in a store is a privilege, not a right,\" the group said. Marc Perrone, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers International union, also calls on government officials to make face coverings mandatory. \"With governors in the majority of states refusing to make masks mandatory, millions of Americans are needlessly being put in danger every day,\" he said in a statement. \"It's time for elected leaders to pull their heads out of the sand and make masks mandatory in all 50 states to protect these brave workers and the millions of families they serve.\" Moreover, the union is calling for enforcement by trained professionals, rather than retail workers who are \"already stretched thin during this pandemic.\" Commenters on Twitter are already preparing for all the videos of the backlash from angry Walmart shoppers who want to shop without a mask. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Walmart stock has gained 10.6% over the year so far while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56%  is down 6.5%."}]}
