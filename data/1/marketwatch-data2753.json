House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Thursday that changes imposed by the new, Republican postmaster general \u201cthreaten the timely delivery of mail \u2014 including medicines for seniors, paychecks for workers and absentee ballots for voters \u2014 that is essential to millions of Americans.\u2019\u2019 In separate letters, two Montana Republicans, Sen. Steve Daines and Rep. Greg Gianforte, also urged the Postal Service to reverse the July directive, which eliminates overtime for hundreds of thousands of postal workers and mandates that mail be kept until the next day if distribution centers are running late. \u201cThis action, if not rescinded, will negatively impact mail delivery for Montanans and unacceptably increase the risk of late prescriptions, commercial products or bill delivery,\u2019\u2019 Daines said Thursday in a letter to Postmaster General Louis DeJoy. \u201cDelaying mail service is unacceptable,\u201d Gianforte wrote to DeJoy. \u201cDo not continue down this road.\u201d In their letter, Pelosi and Schumer acknowledged that the Postal Service continues to face financial challenges, but said \u201cenacting these policies as cost-cutting or efficiency measures as the COVID-19 public health emergency continues is counterproductive and unacceptable.\u2019\u2019 During the pandemic, \u201cAmericans have turned to the Postal Service and depend on it for timely delivery of critical goods and a safe alternative to in-person interactions. As a result, we believe these changes must be reversed,\u2019\u2019 the Democrats said. The flurry of letters came as the top Democrat on a Senate panel that oversees the Postal Service launched an investigation into the operational changes that he said \u201care preventing Americans from receiving critical mail on time, including prescription drugs, business mail and mail-in ballots.\u201d The cost-cutting measures, intended to address the Postal Service\u2019s longtime financial problems, were imposed last month after DeJoy, a Republican fundraiser and former supply-chain executive, took over the top job in June. DeJoy, 63, of North Carolina, is a major donor to President Donald Trump and the Republican Party. He is the first postmaster general in nearly two decades who is not a career postal employee. Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, the top Democrat on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said DeJoy has failed to provide answers about the service delays, despite repeated requests. Peters is asking the public to provide their stories about delays or other problems with deliveries. The Senate inquiry comes as lawmakers increasingly focus on the Postal Service, which is reeling from mail delays and financial problems at a time when record numbers of mail ballots are expected in the November presidential election because of the coronavirus pandemic. The House Oversight Committee has called DeJoy to testify at a hearing next month. Trump, a vocal critic of the Postal Service, contended Wednesday that \u201cthe Post Office doesn\u2019t have enough time\u201d to handle a significant increase in mail-in ballots. \u201cI mean you\u2019re talking about millions of votes. .. It\u2019s a catastrophe waiting to happen.\u201d DeJoy met with Schumer and Pelosi Wednesday in a closed-door session that Schumer called \u201ca heated discussion.\u201d Democrats told DeJoy that \u201celections are sacred\u201d and urged him not to impose cutbacks \u201cat a time when all ballots count,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cFor 245 years, the Postal Service has worked to provide reliable, consistent and on-time delivery that keeps Americans connected no matter where they live \u2013 especially in rural areas,\u201d Peters said. \u201cUnfortunately, in recent weeks, I\u2019ve heard firsthand from constituents, postal workers and local officials in Michigan who have encountered problems with the timely and dependable service they count on to conduct business, get prescription medications and critical supplies and even exercise their right to vote.\u2019\u2019 Democrats have pushed for $10 billion for the Postal Service in talks with Republicans on a huge COVID-19 response bill. The figure is down from a $25 billion plan in a House-passed coronavirus measure. Key Republicans whose rural constituents are especially reliant on the post office support the idea. With her state\u2019s vast and difficult terrain, \u201cthe Postal Service is a primary source of knowledge, commerce and basic necessities,\u201d said Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska. For Alaskans, additional help from Congress \u201cis truly a necessity \u2014 not a convenience,\u2019\u2019 she said. David Partenheimer, a spokesman for the Postal Service, declined to comment on the letter from Democrats. But he said the agency is using all available resources to \u201cmatch the workload created by the impacts of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\u201d The Postal Service has \u201ca liberal leave policy\u201d and is aggressively trying to hire qualified candidates to replace tens of thousands of workers who have gotten sick or opted not to work because of the pandemic, he said. \u201cWe appreciate the patience of our customers and the efforts of employees as conditions change on a day-to-day basis,\u201d he said. Partenheimer disputed reports that the Postal Service is slowing down election mail or any other mail. \u201cWe continue to employ a robust and proven process to ensure proper handling of all election mail consistent with our standards,\u2019\u2019 he said."}]}
