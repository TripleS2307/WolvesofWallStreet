The company has not commented on the news reported by the Denver Business Journal, but Palantir\u2019s website now shows Denver as its headquarters, as does its Wikipedia entry. A Palo Alto office remains on the list of locations on the company\u2019s website. Palantir Chief Executive Alex Karp had said in a May interview on \u201cAxios on HBO\u201d that the company was considering California and the \u201cincreasing intolerance and monoculture\u201d of Silicon Valley. Palantir has been the subject of protests by activists and its own employees over its work with the U.S. government, including the fact that its software is used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the tracking, detaining and deportation of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. The company, which is valued at $20 billion and also provides technology to large businesses, confidentially filed paperwork in July to go public. A Japanese wealth manager said earlier this month that Palantir plans to go public via a direct listing by the end of September."}]}
