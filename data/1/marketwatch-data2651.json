The new rule, issued July 10 by the Department of Health and Human Services, went into effect July 15. The last set of data is from July 14. Rather than send COVID-19-related data to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as has been done since March, hospitals, hospital laboratories, and other acute-care facilities have been told to submit that information to a portal operated by TeleTracking Technologies Inc., a privately held data company. Health officials say the new process will reduce \u201cconfusion and duplication of reporting,\u201d create more flexibility with what data is collected during the pandemic, and better allocate medications such as Gilead Sciences Inc.\u2019s GILD, +0.82% remdesivir. (The terms of the experimental drug\u2019s emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration requires that the medication is allocated by the federal government.)

And will that data be made public to researchers and the public going forward? The coronavirus pandemic in the U.S. is worsening by the day, with more than half of U.S. states now considered COVID-19 \u201chot spots,\u201d based on case count increases over 14 days and high or growing positivity rates, according to the KFF. The rise in cases is in contrast to how countries in Europe and Asia have handled the pandemics within their borders. The U.S. has reported about one-quarter of the world\u2019s coronavirus cases (3.49 million) and deaths (137,420), according to data aggregated by the Johns Hopkins University.

The JHU site sources some data from the project, which focuses on state-level data and was built by journalists at The Atlantic. \u201cWe support more transparency and hope all the HHS data will be released,\u201d The COVID Tracking Project tweeted Wednesday. \u201cThat said, there\u2019s a reason we built a process to capture national numbers that doesn\u2019t rely on our national government.\u201d Sen. Kamala Harris, a Democrat from California, agreed. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } The data submitted to the federal government by hospitals includes important indicators such as intensive care unit bed capacity, the total number of mechanical ventilators in a facility, and the total number of hospitalized, suspected or confirmed positive COVID patients being treated in their facilities. At least one online dashboard operated by the CDC sharing hospital bed capacity at the state level was taken down on Thursday and then reinstated, with a disclaimer noting that the most recent data is from July 14, the day before the rule went into effect."}]}
