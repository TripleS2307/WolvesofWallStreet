Nicolai Tangen, chief executive of Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), which runs the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest sovereign-wealth fund, told the Financial Times that the fund, should \u00e2\u0080\u009cuse risk in a more clever way\u00e2\u0080\u009d by divesting its holdings in more companies for ESG reasons. The fund, which owns 1.5% of globally listed stocks and portfolios of bonds and real estate, sold out of 42 companies in 2019 following assessments of ESG risks. These included shedding holdings in 16 power producers and 12 mining companies. Tangen said he wanted to increase that number, and was planning to recruit more staff to deal with ESG matters. The fund\u00e2\u0080\u0099s risk-based divestments has helped improve returns in recent years. From 2012 to the end of 2019, they boosted the cumulative return on the equity reference portfolio by around 0.27 percentage points, or 0.02 percentage points annually, according to NBIM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s latest Responsible Investment report. Risk-based divestments linked to climate change and human rights have increased the cumulative return on the equity reference portfolio by 0.21 and 0.06 percentage points respectively.
