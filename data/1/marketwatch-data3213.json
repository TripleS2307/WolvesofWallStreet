SHAK, +1.82% stock fell 2.7% in Tuesday premarket trading after the burger chain announced preliminary second-quarter sales that missed expectations. Shake Shack said sales totaled $91.8 million for the quarter ending June 24, below the FactSet consensus for $101.0 million. The company took a $3.2 million hit from closures and reduced operating hours due to protests and curfews. Same-restaurant sales sank 49% with traffic down 60.1%. The FactSet consensus was for a 43.6% decline. Shake Shack is scheduled to announced second-quarter earnings on August 11. Shake Shack has seen weekly sales increase, kicking off the third quarter with sales of $58,000 and same-restaurant sales falling 39% for the week ending July 1. Digital accounted for about 60% of sales for the week ending July 1. Same-restaurant sales are \"acutely impacted\" by a slow recovery in New York City, one of the company's most important regions.
