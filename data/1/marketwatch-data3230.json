This is something that you might be able to do to,\u201d he says in the roughly 2 1/2-minute video. On Sunday, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for convalescent plasma gathered from people who have recovered from COVID-19 as a treatment for hospitalized coronavirus patients. \u201cThe data from studies conducted this year shows that plasma from patients who\u2019ve recovered from COVID-19 has the potential to help treat those who are suffering from the effects of getting this terrible virus,\u201d FDA commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn said in a statement. \u201cAt the same time, we will continue to work with researchers to continue randomized clinical trials to study the safety and effectiveness of convalescent plasma.\u201d Read more:Trump announces emergency authorization of plasma treatment for COVID-19 Cranston, the Emmy and Tony Award-winning actor who is perhaps best known for playing chemistry teacher turned blue meth cook Walter White on \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d previously walked his 2.6 million followers through the plasma donation process in his Instagram FB, +0.26% video. Basically, the donor\u2019s blood is taken and separated into three parts (including the plasma, platelets and red blood cells) by a centrifuge. The doctors then take the plasma, and the platelets and red blood cells are returned back to the donor. \u201cPretty neat huh?\u201d Cranston\u2019s ticker reads. The center was able to collect 840 milliliters from Cranston during his visit. \u201cBeautiful\u2026liquid gold,\u201d Cranston says, eying the bag of honey-colored plasma. \u201cHopefully it can do some good.\u201d Watch his plasma donation here: People who have fully recovered from COVID-19 for at least two weeks, meaning they had been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus in a lab, and they have been symptom-free for 14 days following their diagnosis, are encouraged to consider donating their plasma. They can find their nearest donation center on the FDA\u2019s \u201cThe Fight Is In Us\u201d resource page. And those who haven\u2019t had COVID-19 can still help by donating their blood, as the pandemic has hurt the U.S. blood supply. Convalescent plasma has been used to treat ebola and flu patients during past viral outbreaks. And preliminary studies have found that convalescent plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients is generally safe to use, and appears to raise the survival rate of those hospitalized with COVID-19. Researchers are studying whether convalescent plasma from recovered coronavirus patients could reduce the severity of COVID-19 illnesses in sick patients by boosting their ability to fight off the virus. More than 70,000 COVID-19 patients in the U.S. have received plasma through a government-funded program during the pandemic, although the FDA noted that convalescent plasma should not be considered the standard of care at this time. The Mayo Clinic has also reported preliminary data from 35,000 coronavirus patients treated with convalescent plasma, which found fewer deaths among people given the plasma within three days of diagnosis, and also among those given plasma with the highest level of COVID-19 antibodies. But this isn\u2019t considered proof yet, because the treatment hasn\u2019t been formally studied. Patients were treated in different ways at different hospitals, for example, so there isn\u2019t firm proof that isolates the plasma as the reason for their improvement, versus some other care they received. Cranston has also been calling on his followers to wear masks and practice social distancing. The actor revealed that he became infected despite being \u201cpretty strict in adhering to the protocols.\u201d \u201cI was one of the lucky ones. Mild symptoms,\u201d he wrote, spurring the public to \u201ckeep wearing the damn mask, keep washing your hands, and stay socially distant.\u201d He added that, \u201cWe can prevail \u2014 but ONLY if we follow the rules together.\u201d Keep up with MarketWatch\u2019s coronavirus coverage here.
