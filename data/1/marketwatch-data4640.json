That would mean American visitors would join Brazilians and Russians as parties that are not welcome in the EU, the paper said. The U.S. leads the world in number of cases of COVID-19 at more than 2.3 million and has the highest death toll in the world at more than 120,000, while President Donald Trump has doubled down on his logic that the rise is because of increased testing. A New York Times tracker showed that 26 states are still seeing increasing infections of the deadly illness. American visitors have been excluded from visiting the EU except for \"essential\" travel since mid-March, but a final decision on opening borders is not expected until next week, ahead of the bloc reopening on July 1."}]}
