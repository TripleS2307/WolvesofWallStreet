Results published in The New England Journal of Medicine showed that a two-dose vaccination schedule induced the desired immune response in all 45 people evaluated, a larger group than in the preliminary data Moderna MRNA, +0.09% released in May, and was generally safe and well-tolerated, the company said. Shares of Moderna already rallied after-hours Tuesday. The company is a front-runner among several developing experimental COVID-19 vaccines. The results \u201creaffirm the positive interim data\u201d released back in May, Moderna said. The trial vaccine \u201cinduced rapid and strong immune responses against SARS-CoV-2,\u201d the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. No serious adverse effects were reported, but some that did occur, such as headaches and fatigue, were \u201cgenerally transient and mild to moderate in severity,\u201d the company said. Moderna is evaluating whether the participants\u2019 immune responses are lasting, with participants followed for one year. A Phase 3 study will start this month \u201cto demonstrate our vaccine\u2019s ability to significantly reduce the risk of COVID-19 disease,\u201d Moderna said. It added that it remained on track \u201cto be able to deliver approximately 500 million doses per year, and possibly up to 1 billion doses per year\u201d beginning in 2021. Moderna last week said it had signed another manufacturing deal for the investigational vaccine, this time with Spain\u2019s Laboratorios Farmac\u00e9uticos Rovi. As part of the race for a coronavirus vaccine, drugmakers have scaled up their vaccine candidates\u2019 production to hasten the time that it would take to distribute a working vaccine. The new details about Moderna\u2019s vaccine candidate emerged as Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about a coronavirus vaccine relatively soon. \u201cWe are in a pretty good place when it comes to a vaccine,\u201d Fauci said at an event late Tuesday. \u201cIf things work out the way we hope they do,\u201d a safe and effective vaccine would be ready for distribution by late 2020, beginning of 2021, he said. \u201cI\u2019m cautiously optimistic about that.\u201d Assuming that timetable is correct, the companies racing to develop a vaccine have promised that many doses will be available right away, Fauci said. Shares of Moderna have nearly quadrupled this year, contrasting with losses around 1% and 7% for the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% in the same period."}]}
