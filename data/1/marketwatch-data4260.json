Silver has seen the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbest of both worlds,\u00e2\u0080\u009d with its precious metal side boosted by safe-haven demand, as economies in China and the U.S. improve, proving the metal a lift as an industrial metal, said Jim Wyckoff, senior analyst at Kitco.com. Silver trades in the lower half of its historical trading range, and has \u00e2\u0080\u009cmuch more upside potential,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told MarketWatch. Gold is not far from its all-time high, but silver still has long way to go before it nears its record high, making silver look \u00e2\u0080\u009cundervalued\u00e2\u0080\u009d to investors, he said. \u201c The all-time high for silver; in the coming years is not out of reach, and maybe much sooner than anybody thinks.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Jim Wyckoff, Kitco.com The record settlement level for most-active gold futures stands at $1,891.90 from August 22, 2011.

Ross Norman, chief executive officer of precious metals news and information provider Metals Daily, said now that silver has rallied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis frees gold up to continue what has already been an impressive rally,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and both metals are \u00e2\u0080\u009cbetter aligned.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cSilver has seen very strong inflows into both the [exchange-traded funds] and in the futures market on Comex, prompting a breakout on the charts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told MarketWatch. Given that, Metals Daily has adjusted its second-half 2020 forecast on the metal to $25, up from a previous forecast of $23. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGlobal macro events are positive precious metals and even though silver is partly an industrial metal, it is a case of a rising tide lifting all boats,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Norman. As for how high silver prices may go from here, Grosskopf said silver has \u00e2\u0080\u009cmore torque\u00e2\u0080\u009d to move up than gold, and \u00e2\u0080\u009cintermediate charts\u00e2\u0080\u009d point to $30 an ounce.
