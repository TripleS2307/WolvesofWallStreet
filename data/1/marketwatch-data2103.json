Each car has a midengine configuration. The Chevy is more value-conscious, and the Lamborghini is the more exotic option. You might not normally think that a Chevrolet has much in common with a Lamborghini. But with the all-new C8 generation of the Corvette making the big switch to a midengine configuration, it's now a midengine luxury sports car, which technically puts it in the same segment as the Lamborghini Hurac\u00c3\u00a1n. The Lamborghini Hurac\u00c3\u00a1n. Lamborghini Let's take a look at the differences and similarities between these stunning sports cars.Exterior The C8 has a decidedly more exotic aesthetic than previous generations of the Vette. That's because the new midengine configuration changes the shape of the car. The Corvette's look is more exotic than ever, and the sharp, dramatic lines of the C8 make it a head-turner wherever it goes. The Hurac\u00c3\u00a1n has its own exotic look, and it's unmistakably a Lamborghini from any angle. Its unique scissor doors open vertically and add to the car's exotic nature. In classic Lambo fashion, the Hurac\u00c3\u00a1n has a variety of eye-popping paint colors to make it stand out even more than it already does.

The Chevy is about 4 inches longer and 3 inches taller than the Lamborghini, and the cars are identical in width. Each car is available as a coupe or as a convertible with a retractable hardtop.Interior Each car seats two, and each has a very driver-centric interior design. Each car uses premium materials throughout the cabin, but the Hurac\u00c3\u00a1n looks and feels a bit more high-end on the inside than the C8 does. That said, the Chevy is more luxurious than ever, and its interior deserves a lot of praise for its price point. The C8 also has a surprising amount of cargo space, which adds to its practicality, while cargo capacity is a bit lacking in the Hurac\u00c3\u00a1n. You probably won't be going camping in either car, but that extra storage space is nice to have in the 'Vette. Mechanicals For the 2020 model year, the all-new C8 has only one engine. It's a near certainty that higher-performance versions of the C8 are in development, but for now, there's just the base engine. You won't hear us complaining, as it's an excellent engine, but we're itching to get behind the wheel of a faster C8.

Every 2020 C8 has rear-wheel drive, whereas the Hurac\u00c3\u00a1n can be had with either RWD or all-wheel drive.2020 Chevrolet Corvette engine 6.2-liter V8; up to 495 horsepower, 470 lb-ft of torque; 15 mpg city/27 mpg hwy; 0-to-60 mph in 2.8 seconds; top speed: 194 mph 2020 Lamborghini Hurac\u00c3\u00a1n engine 5.2-liter V10; 630 hp, 442 lb-ft of torque; 13 mpg city/18 mpg hwy; 0-to-60 mph in 2.9 seconds; top speed: 202 mph Despite a pretty big difference in horsepower, the C8 and the Hurac\u00c3\u00a1n have very similar top speeds and acceleration times. The C8 is also quite a bit more efficient than the Hurac\u00c3\u00a1n. You're probably not buying either car with frugal fuel economy in mind, but that the Chevy makes fewer trips to the gas station is a nice perk.

However, if you want features like a head-up display, forward-collision warning and blind-spot monitoring, they're available as options on the Chevy. The C8 comes standard with a nice, user-friendly infotainment system with Android Auto and Apple AAPL, +1.74%  CarPlay and standard Bose premium audio. The Hurac\u00c3\u00a1n has a nice 8.4-in touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Amazon AMZN, +3.01%  Alexa, giving it voice control, which is nice to have when you're focused on driving your Italian supercar.Pricing The biggest difference between these cars is the price. The 2020 Chevrolet Corvette has a starting MSRP of $58,900, although you'll be hard-pressed to actually find one for sale at that price. On the high end, a fully loaded C8 convertible is around the $80,000 mark, at least according to Chevy. Beware of dealer markup.

The base price of the 2020 Lamborghini Hurac\u00c3\u00a1n is $261,274, and if you opt for the Spyder convertible, that bumps the price to $287,400. That's a price increase of about 350% compared with the Chevy - or more than 250% if you jump from the fully loaded C8 convertible to the Spyder. Is the Hurac\u00c3\u00a1n 350% better than the C8? That's debatable - but we think most drivers would say no.Conclusion While there isn't a version of the C8 Corvette that can match the impressive horsepower rating of the raucous V10 under the hood of the Hurac\u00c3\u00a1n, it's hard to deny that the C8 is a much better value than the Lambo. The Hurac\u00c3\u00a1n has an exotic presence that refuses to be ignored, and driving one is a truly special experience. However, its price puts it well out of reach for the vast majority of drivers. The Corvette has always been one of the best values in sports cars, and that reputation is alive and well in 2020 with the new midengine C8. This story originally ran on Autotrader.com."}]}
