Each car has a midengine configuration. The\u00c2 Chevy\u00c2 is more value-conscious, and the\u00c2 Lamborghini\u00c2 is the more exotic option. You might not normally think that a\u00c2 Chevrolet\u00c2 has much in common with a\u00c2 Lamborghini. But with the all-new C8 generation of the\u00c2 Corvette\u00c2 making the big switch to a midengine configuration, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s now a midengine luxury sports car, which technically puts it in the same segment as the\u00c2 Lamborghini Hurac\u00c3\u00a1n. The Lamborghini Hurac\u00c3\u00a1n. Lamborghini Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s take a look at the differences and similarities between these stunning sports cars.Exterior The C8 has a decidedly more exotic aesthetic than previous generations of the Vette. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because the new midengine configuration changes the shape of the car. The Corvette\u00e2\u0080\u0099s look is more exotic than ever, and the sharp, dramatic lines of the C8 make it a head-turner wherever it goes.\u00c2 The Hurac\u00c3\u00a1n has its own exotic look, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unmistakably a Lamborghini from any angle. Its unique scissor doors open vertically and add to the car\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exotic nature. In classic Lambo fashion, the Hurac\u00c3\u00a1n has a variety of eye-popping paint colors to make it stand out even more than it already does.\u00c2 Read: The 2020 Acura NSX: It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fast, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thrilling The C8 is slightly larger than the Hurac\u00c3\u00a1n. The Chevy is about 4 inches longer and 3 inches taller than the Lamborghini, and the cars are identical in width. Each car is available as a coupe or as a convertible with a retractable hardtop.Interior Each car seats two, and each has a very driver-centric interior design. Each car uses premium materials throughout the cabin, but the Hurac\u00c3\u00a1n looks and feels a bit more high-end on the inside than the C8 does. That said, the Chevy is more luxurious than ever, and its interior deserves a lot of praise for its price point. The C8 also has a surprising amount of cargo space, which adds to its practicality, while cargo capacity is a bit lacking in the Hurac\u00c3\u00a1n. You probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be going camping in either car, but that extra storage space is nice to have in the \u00e2\u0080\u0099Vette.\u00c2 Mechanicals For the 2020 model year, the all-new C8 has only one engine. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a near certainty that higher-performance versions of the C8 are in development, but for now, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just the base engine. You won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hear us complaining, as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an excellent engine, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re itching to get behind the wheel of a faster C8. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss: AAA expects cheapest summer gasoline prices since 2016 The Hurac\u00c3\u00a1n also has one engine. Every 2020 C8 has\u00c2 rear-wheel drive, whereas the Hurac\u00c3\u00a1n can be had with either RWD or\u00c2 all-wheel drive.2020 Chevrolet Corvette engine 6.2-liter V8; up to 495 horsepower, 470 lb-ft of torque; 15 mpg city/27 mpg hwy; 0-to-60 mph in 2.8 seconds; top speed: 194 mph 2020 Lamborghini Hurac\u00c3\u00a1n engine 5.2-liter V10; 630 hp, 442 lb-ft of torque; 13 mpg city/18 mpg hwy; 0-to-60 mph in 2.9 seconds; top speed: 202 mph Despite a pretty big difference in horsepower, the C8 and the Hurac\u00c3\u00a1n have very similar top speeds and acceleration times. The C8 is also quite a bit more efficient than the Hurac\u00c3\u00a1n. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re probably not buying either car with frugal fuel economy in mind, but that the Chevy makes fewer trips to the gas station is a nice perk.\u00c2 Also read: Ford Ranger named \u00e2\u0080\u0098most American-made car\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in annual list that includes Tesla for first timeTechnology Because both cars are all about the driving experience, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find a lot of modern driver assistance technology at the base level of either. However, if you want features like a head-up display, forward-collision warning and blind-spot monitoring, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re available as options on the Chevy. The C8 comes standard with a nice, user-friendly infotainment system with Android Auto and Apple AAPL, +1.74% \u00c2 CarPlay and standard Bose premium audio. The Hurac\u00c3\u00a1n has a nice 8.4-in touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Amazon AMZN, +3.01% \u00c2 Alexa, giving it voice control, which is nice to have when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re focused on driving your Italian supercar.Pricing The biggest difference between these cars is the price. The\u00c2 2020 Chevrolet Corvette\u00c2 has a starting MSRP of $58,900, although you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be hard-pressed to actually find one for sale at that price. On the high end, a fully loaded C8 convertible is around the $80,000 mark, at least according to Chevy. Beware of dealer markup. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss: What it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like to drive a Tesla Model Y You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be paying a bit more for the Lambo. The base price of the\u00c2 2020 Lamborghini Hurac\u00c3\u00a1n\u00c2 is $261,274, and if you opt for the Spyder convertible, that bumps the price to $287,400. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a price increase of about 350% compared with the Chevy \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or more than 250% if you jump from the fully loaded C8 convertible to the Spyder. Is the Hurac\u00c3\u00a1n 350% better than the C8? That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s debatable \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but we think most drivers would say no.Conclusion While there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a version of the C8 Corvette that can match the impressive horsepower rating of the raucous V10 under the hood of the Hurac\u00c3\u00a1n, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to deny that the C8 is a much better value than the Lambo. The Hurac\u00c3\u00a1n has an exotic presence that refuses to be ignored, and driving one is a truly special experience. However, its price puts it well out of reach for the vast majority of drivers. The Corvette has always been one of the best values in sports cars, and that reputation is alive and well in 2020 with the new midengine C8. This story originally ran on Autotrader.com."}]}
