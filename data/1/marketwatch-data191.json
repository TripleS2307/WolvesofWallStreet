(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) Hopes for a restart of talks over a large-scale U.S. economic stimulus package, or even more targeted aid for the troubled airline industry, took a big hit Thursday after Democrat House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she still wanted a bigger bargain. \u201cThere is no stand-alone bill without a bigger bill. There is no bill,\u201d Pelosi told reporters at her weekly press conference at the U.S. Capitol. Pelosi was responding to a question asking if she would accept a stand-alone bill aimed at providing a second round of grants to passenger and cargo airlines to help them retain workers. She softened the stance slightly later in an interview with Bloomberg Television, allowing that an airline bill could possibly move at a different time than a more comprehensive measure but only if that companion piece of legislation was also agreed. \u201cWe can do that separately, but we cannot do it unless there\u2019s a big bill,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, it can be part of a big bill or it could be separate from a big bill from a timing standpoint, but there won\u2019t be anything unless we crush the virus, put money in the pockets of the American people. \u201c \u201cWe can do that separately, but we cannot do it unless there\u2019s a big bill.\u201d \u2013 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Still, after President Donald Trump said he was pulling out of talks Tuesday, then reversed course and tweeted he wanted to sign smaller measures for the airlines and for direct payments to households, and Pelosi said she was only conditionally open to airline help Wednesday, talks looked to be stalled again as they have been since early August. Pelosi\u2019s counterpart in the Senate, Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, told reporters at a Kentucky campaign appearance Thursday that he was not upbeat about the prospects for a deal before the elections in November. \u201cI think it\u2019s uncertain, but we\u2019re still talking, \u201d he said. \u201cI do think the proximity to the election has made this much more challenging.\u201d Trump earlier Thursday, in a phone interview with Fox Business Network, had said stimulus talks were going well, raising hopes for either an airline package or a renewal of talks for a bigger package.

The political popularity of moving another package before the election instead of waiting for the post-election lame duck session has made both sides reluctant to be seen publicly as the one ending talks. But Trump provided an advantage for Democrats with his Tuesday tweet saying the Senate should give priority to confirming a new U.S. Supreme Court justice rather than another fiscal stimulus package. Trump later reversed himself with the tweets saying he wanted legislation on aid to airlines and payments to households. Similarly, Pelosi appeared to leave some room open to more talks as well as she left the press conference. \u201cWe\u2019ve told the White House we\u2019re at the table. We\u2019re at the table,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to continue the conversation. We\u2019ve made some progress, we\u2019re exchanging language. And then, so, we\u2019ll see how they come back.\u201d Rep. Josh Gottheimer, a Democratic representative from New Jersey and a leader of bipartisan group called the Problem Solvers Caucus that pitched its own package, said he is not giving up hope. But he said some of his colleagues worried what issues might get left out of a piecemeal approach. The risk, he said, is \u201cyou end up leaving pieces out that need to get done.\u201d Read more: Coronavirus relief effort stalled because only the poor are hurting: former Fed economist"}]}
