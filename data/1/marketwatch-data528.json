Matthias Hangst/Getty Images Any near-term bounce from a new fiscal plan is likely to be \u00e2\u0080\u009cshort-lived,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to Miller Tabak & Co\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lead strategist Matt Maley. Maley said Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s positive COVID-19 test improved the chances of a new stimulus boost, as it gave both sides the opportunity to concede ground without losing face. However, he warned multiple factors meant any pop fueled by a deal would be brief.

The market is still quite overvalued and the combination of the weakening employment picture plus a second wave of the virus does not bode well for any improvement for the \u00e2\u0080\u0098E\u00e2\u0080\u0099 part [earnings] of the P/E ratio going forward,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Maley said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMore importantly, history shows us that stimulus programs play a much bigger role as a catalyst for a strong/sustained rally when the stock market is flat on its back\u00e2\u0080\u00a6not after a strong six-month rally,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, noting that the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% was still more than 50% above its March lows,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. He added that another \u00e2\u0080\u009cdown-leg\u00e2\u0080\u009d to the September correction will come in October before we see a sustainable rally in stocks.
