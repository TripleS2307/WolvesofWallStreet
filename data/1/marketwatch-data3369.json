Morgan turns bullish, citing valuation and potential catalysts", "body": "Shares of Nikola Corp. NKLA, -1.36% soared 13% in premarket trading Wednesday, putting them on track to snap a five-day losing streak, after J.P. Morgan turned bullish on the battery- and hydrogen-electric truck maker, citing a more attractive valuation following the recent selloff. Analyst Paul Coster raised his rating to overweight, less than a month after initiating Nikola at neutral on June 22. He kept his stock price target at $45, which is 10.6% above Tuesday's closing price of $40.23. The stock has plunged 40.5% over the past five sessions, and has shed 45.1% since the June 8 record close of $73.27, after rocketing more than fivefold in three months to the record close. Coster said that while the shares \"could fall some more\" as more of shares of the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), or blank-check company, that merged with Nikola become freely tradable, the stock is \"starting to look attractive for long-term investors\" below his target of $45, as a number of potential catalysts come into view. \"In our view, [Nikola] is currently a story-stock, but we are on board as long as the company executes to plan, and providing the stock offers a favorable risk-reward trade-off,\" Coster wrote in a note to clients. Among potential upcoming catalysts include an announcement of an original equipment manufacturing partner for the Badger truck, an H2 station deployment plan for the U.K. and accelerated implementation plans for the fuel-cell truck. The stock has run up nearly fourfold year to date, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% has lost 2.7%."}]}
