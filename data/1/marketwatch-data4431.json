He then bestowed the stock with \u00e2\u0080\u009cround-trip chart of the year\u00e2\u0080\u009d honors a few months after that. Now, with Tesla stock TSLA, +1.89% splitting and pushing even deeper into uncharted territory, Wolf Richter of the popular Wolf Street blog just posted another chart to commemorate the occasion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s market cap soared by $64 billion in eight hours, including after hours. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s $8 billion in \u00e2\u0080\u0098value created\u00e2\u0080\u0099 per hour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Richter wrote in a blog post late Monday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you have to ask, \u00e2\u0080\u0098value created by doing what,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 then you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the right stuff. Simple as that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He then put Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s market cap in perspective: Apple AAPL, +1.74% : $2.21 trillion Amazon AMZN, +3.01% : $1.73 trillion Microsoft MSFT, +2.48% : $1.71 trillion Google GOOG, +1.97% : $1.11 trillion Facebook FB, +0.26% : $835 billion Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A, +0.06% : $521 billion Tesla: $476 billion\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cTesla, the minuscule automaker with a global market share of less than 1%, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actually an automaker with stagnant revenues in a long-term stagnant or declining industry, but a data company with a secret government contract to populate Mars or whatever,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Richter wrote, with more than a hint of sarcasm. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou just have to put your brain on Tesla Autopilot and believe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Read: His short just got \u00e2\u0080\u0098obliterated,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 but this Tesla bear keeps trying Tesla\u00c2 gave up gains on Tuesday, after the company took advantage of the stock\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best monthly performance in seven years\u00c2 to raise more capital.
