The London stock-exchange operator said it will also receive an additional amount reflecting cash generation to completion. The deal is conditional upon, among other things, the divestment of Borsa Italiana or any material part of the business being a condition of any European Commission clearance decision for LSE Group's own acquisition of Refinitiv, the company said. LSE Group in July said it was in exploratory talks to sell its interest in Italian fixed-income trading market MTS SpA--or potentially the Borsa Italiana as a whole--in order to satisfy the European Commission regarding its own deal to acquire data provider Refinitiv. Euronext said the acquisition of Borsa Italiana will result in the creation of the leading player in European capital-markets infrastructure. Completion of the deal is expected in the first half of 2021, Euronext said."}]}
