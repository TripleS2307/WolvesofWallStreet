U.S. markets on Monday will be closed in observance of Labor Day, a factor that might have added to market volatility by sapping volume in the run-up to the long holiday weekend.How did stock-market benchmarks perform? The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% closed 159.42 points lower, down 0.6%, at 28133.31, after falling 628 points at its session low.

In One Chart:Tech stocks and the rest of the market are both very expensive -- but for very different reasonsWhat drove the market? \u201cWe view the latest selloff as a bout of profit-taking after a strong run,\u201d said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a note. The S&P 500 rose 7% last month for its strongest August in 34 years, then added another 2.3% in the first two days of September to hit another record high before Thursday\u2019s selloff, he noted. \u201cStocks are still well-supported by a combination of Fed liquidity, attractive equity risk premiums, and an ongoing recovery as economies reopen from the lockdowns.\u201d The S&P 500 index tech sector fell 1.3% Friday, while the similarly popular communications services sector gave back another 1.9% and consumer discretionary stocks fell 1.4%. Meanwhile, beaten down sectors found buying interest, with financials up 0.8%, industrials up 0.2% and materials up 0.1%. Market bulls expect that pattern to continue in the near term, a potential positive for the broader market. \u201cLook for the bull market to continue [on] some sector rotation as people take profits in technology names and put more money to work in more cyclical parts of the market such as in the energy, materials and financials sectors,\u201d said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance, in emailed comments. Signs of rotation were evident when it comes to investing styles, with the iShares Edge MSCI USA Value Factor ETF VLUE, -0.50% rising 0.5%, while the iShares Edge MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF MTUM, +1.24% fell 1%. Momentum has substantially outperformed value in 2020, with MTUM up 16.9% in the year to date versus a 15.5% fall for VLUE. Stocks had earlier opened mostly higher after a July jobs report that was better-than-estimated but still reflective of a slowdown in the economic recovery, but equities soon turned south in morning trade. See:\u2018What\u2019s concerning is that the pace of jobs growth is slowing down\u2019 \u2014 economists react to August jobs report Data from the Labor Department showed that the economy regained 1.4 million jobs in August and the unemployment rate fell to 8.4% from 10.2%. Economists polled by MarketWatch had predicted an increase of 1.2 million jobs. Private-sector payrolls rose by a smaller 1 million. Hours worked rose 0.1 hour to 34.6 hours. The increase in hiring in July was revised down slightly to 1.73 million. The report showed that the gains are \u201cslow but steady which is actually a perfect thing to see overall,\u201d JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist for TD Ameritrade, told MarketWatch. That said, the strategist thinks investors may need to see more progress, especially given where the labor-market was in February. Mike Loewengart, managing director investment strategy at E-Trade Financial US:ETFC, said that investors could see more turbulence after Thursday\u2019s unsettling action. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve been in the throes of the type of volatility that defined the market earlier this year, so investors may have some post-traumatic stress after yesterday\u2019s landslide,\u201d he wrote in emailed comments on Friday. \u201cFor some perspective, September ushers in a historically volatile period for the market, and has a particularly bearish reputation,\u201d he wrote. \u201cCertainly, wide price swings are never comfortable, but investors should keep in mind that periods of volatility like this are not uncommon, especially on the heels of an epic rally, and should be taken in stride,\u201d Loewengart said.
