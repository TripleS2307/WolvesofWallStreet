Rand Paul questioning whether the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top infectious disease experts have been doing more harm than good during the pandemic. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a fatal conceit to believe any one person or small group of people has the knowledge necessary to direct an economy or dictate public health behavior,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Republican and libertarian from Kentucky said during the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee hearing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t presume that a group of experts somehow knows what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best for everyone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d His argument was that health experts and government \u00e2\u0080\u009cplanners\u00e2\u0080\u009d are weighing in on subjects and expressing opinions that affect everyday public life before getting all of their facts straight. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to realize that if society meekly submits to an expert and that expert is wrong, a great deal of harm may occur when we allow one man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policy or one group of small men and women to be foisted on an entire nation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. And Paul, who tested positive for the coronavirus in March, when he drew flak for not quarantining while he was awaiting his test results, directed some of his sharpest rebukes toward Anthony Fauci on Tuesday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDr. Fauci, every day, virtually every day, we seem to hear from you things we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re asked, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Can we go back to school?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hear much certitude at all. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, maybe. It depends.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll I hear, Dr. Fauci, is, \u00e2\u0080\u0098We can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do this, we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do that. We can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t play baseball.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Well, even that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not based on the science.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Sen. Rand Paul \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe just need more optimism,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Paul said. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, responded by noting he agrees with a lot of what Paul said, particularly with regards to people sharing opinions not backed by scientific data. He also said that \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe need to do whatever we can to get the children back in school.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But, Fauci continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSometimes you have to make extrapolations because you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in a position where you need to give some sort of recommendation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And he noted that his recommendations are often interpreted in ways that he did not intend. \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe only thing that I can do is, to the best of my ability, give you the facts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Dr. Anthony Fauci \u00e2\u0080\u009cI never said we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t play a certain sport,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. (Although it should be noted that he did recently warn that \u00e2\u0080\u009cfootball may not happen this year\u00e2\u0080\u009d on CNN.) \u00e2\u0080\u009cI agree with you. I am completely unqualified to tell you whether you can play a sport or not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe only thing that I can do is, to the best of my ability, give you the facts and the evidence associated with what I know about this outbreak. Thank you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Watch some of that exchange here iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } The back-and-forth had Paul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name trending on Twitter TWTR, -0.23% \u00c2 on Tuesday afternoon, as the debate illustrated the split opinions Americans have had to the widespread closures and social distancing guidelines across the country since the pandemic began.
