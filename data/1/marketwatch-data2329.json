Unilever said the move will make it easier for the company to do share-based acquisitions, remove complexity and further strengthen its corporate governance. Unilever said it will maintain its listings on the Amsterdam, London and New York stock exchanges and there will be no change to the operations, locations, activities or staffing levels in either the United Kingdom or The Netherlands as a result of unification. Unilever said a demerger of the tea business is one potential outcome of a portfolio review and, as was previously the case with the disposal of the company's spreads business, would be significantly more challenging under the current legal structure than under a single parent structure. It will headquarter and list the foods and refreshment division in the Netherlands if spun out as an independent company."}]}
