Greg Abbott issued an executive order on Friday that requires all bars to close at noon and imposes restrictions on outdoor activities, making Texas the first state to reimpose a lockdown after lifting it. The order allows restaurants to remain open for dine-in service but at a capacity of no more than 50% starting Monday. Restaurants are currently operating at 75% capacity. Rafting and tubing businesses will be closed and gatherings of more than 100 people must be approved by local governments. \"As I said from the start, if the positivity rate rose above 10%, the State of Texas would take further action to mitigate the spread of COVID-19,\" the governor said in a statement. \"At this time, it is clear that the rise in cases is largely driven by certain types of activities, including Texans congregating in bars.\" The move comes a day after Abbott said he was pausing the next phase of reopening to stem the spread of the virus. The governor urged Texans to wash their hands frequently, wear a face mask and observe social distancing. Texas was one of the first states to lift its stay-at-home order on April 30. The state is one of 30 that are seeing spikes in infection rates, according to a New York Times tracker."}]}
