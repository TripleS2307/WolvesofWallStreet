The house-improvement company said like-for-like sales for the quarter ended July 18 rose 22% year-on-year, boosted by strong e-commerce and reopening stores in France and the U.K. Online like-for-like sales in May and June more than trebled on the year, it said. Year-to-date like-for-like sales as of July 18 were down 3.7%. The company said it benefited from cost cutting during the first half of the fiscal year."}]}
