Technology stocks have been at the vanguard of the rally in U.S. equities since the lows seen in March after the coronavirus pandemic first hit and the tech-heavy Nasdaq has led the recovery among stock benchmarks, outstripping the performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% and the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87%. Read: Why Stanley Druckenmiller says the risk-reward of investing in stocks has never been worse Some semblance of a rebound was taking shape early Wednesday but Druckenmiller says that the Fed may have set the stage for the possibility of surging inflation or deflation as it changes its policy framework to allow for average-inflation targeting. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re risking in terms of financial stability to get that 2% mark\u00e2\u0080\u00a6and my own sort of central case, for the first time in a long long time, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m actually worried about inflation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Druckenmiller said. The chairman and chief executive of Duquesne Family Office says he thinks that the current stance of the Fed is \u00e2\u0080\u009cdangerous.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe actually have the chairman of the Federal Reserve with a $3.5 trillion deficit out lobbying Congress to do more spending and then guaranteeing those of us on Wall Street that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll underwrite it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told the business network. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dangerous. I think we could easily see 5 to 10% inflation in the next four or five years. Ironically, I also think he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s raised the risk of deflation because\u00e2\u0080\u00a6everyone was proceed by an asset bubble and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s created this massive asset bubble.\u00e2\u0080\u009d See: Investing legend known for his annual predictions says the world could be in for a big surprise \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in a good way Check out: Why an approved coronavirus vaccine may not end the pandemic quickly"}]}
