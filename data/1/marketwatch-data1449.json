Technology stocks have been at the vanguard of the rally in U.S. equities since the lows seen in March after the coronavirus pandemic first hit and the tech-heavy Nasdaq has led the recovery among stock benchmarks, outstripping the performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% and the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87%.

The chairman and chief executive of Duquesne Family Office says he thinks that the current stance of the Fed is \"dangerous.\" \"We actually have the chairman of the Federal Reserve with a $3.5 trillion deficit out lobbying Congress to do more spending and then guaranteeing those of us on Wall Street that he'll underwrite it,\" he told the business network. \"I think it's dangerous. I think we could easily see 5 to 10% inflation in the next four or five years. Ironically, I also think he's raised the risk of deflation because\u00e2\u0080\u00a6everyone was proceed by an asset bubble and he's created this massive asset bubble.\" See: Investing legend known for his annual predictions says the world could be in for a big surprise - in a good way Check out: Why an approved coronavirus vaccine may not end the pandemic quickly"}]}
