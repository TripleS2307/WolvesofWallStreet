SIRI, -2.01% shot up 7.2% in premarket trading Wednesday, after a Bloomberg report that the satellite radio company is nearing a contract renewal with shock jock Howard Stern. Citing people familiar with the matter, the new contract could raise his annual pay to about $120 million a year, Bloomberg reported. Benchmark analyst Matthew Harrigan said the retention of Stern would be a \"nice positive\" for Sirius, and would wrap up a major \"dangling issue\" for incoming chief executive officer Jennifer Witz. The current contract, which expires at the end of December, topped out at roughly $80 million to $100 million a year, the report said. Separately, the company said late Tuesday that it raised its quarterly dividend by 10%, about 1.464 cents a share from 1.331 cents a share. Based on Tuesday's stock closing price of $5.56, the new annual dividend rate implies a dividend yield of 1.05%, compared with the implied yield for the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% of 1.69%, according to FactSet."}]}
