GS, -0.21% surged 2.2% in premarket trading Wednesday, after the brokerage and banking services company reported a second-quarter profit that was well above expectations, amid strong revenue growth in its markets and investment banking businesses. Net income rose to $2.25 billion, or $6.26 a share, from $2.20 billion, or $5.81 a share, in the year-ago period. The FactSet consensus for earnings per share was $3.90. Total revenue grew 41% to $13.30 billion, as non-interest revenue climbed 47% to $12.35 billion to beat the FactSet consensus of $8.77 billion while net interest income fell 12% to $944 million to miss expectations of $1.16 billion. Investment banking revenue rose 36% to a record $2.66 billion, as \"significantly higher\" underwriting revenue partially offset by weakness in corporate lending and financial advisory. Global markets revenue soared 93% to $7.18 billion, as fixed income, currency and commodities (FICC) revenue more than doubled to $4.24 billion from $1.70 billion and equities revenue increased 46% to $2.94 billion. Goldman maintained its quarterly dividend of $1.25 a share. The stock has lost 6.9% year to date through Tuesday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% has slipped 6.6%."}]}
