AAL, +0.34% shares dipped 2% in after-hours trading Wednesday after it sent notices to 25,000 workers -- about one-fifth of its workforce -- about potential furloughs as the airline copes with what it calls slackening demand for air travel during the pandemic. American, which is prohibited from slashing jobs or pay rates through Sept. 30 under terms of $25 billion in federal payroll support, also urged employees to take buyout and early retirement packages before being forced to cut their jobs. The airline, which reported an 80% plunge in June revenue, says it will be overstaffed by 20,000 when federal aid expires Oct. 1. Earlier this month, United Airlines Holdings Inc. UAL, +0.32% warned its workers it could furlough 36,000 of them and likely move to layoffs in August, the Wall Street Journal reported. United had 96,000 employees as of December."}]}
