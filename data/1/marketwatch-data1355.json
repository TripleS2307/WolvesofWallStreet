The lawyers argued Eric Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cextreme travel schedule\u00e2\u0080\u009d related to his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s re-election campaign prevented him from testifying sooner in state Attorney General Letitia James\u00e2\u0080\u0099s civil probe. They said they also wanted \u00e2\u0080\u009cto avoid the use of his deposition attendance for political purposes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u201c Letitia James launched her civil investigation of potential fraud in Trump business dealings in March 2019 after President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s longtime personal lawyer Michael Cohen told Congress that Trump had repeatedly inflated the value of his assets to obtain more favorable terms for loans and insurance coverage. \u201d James, a Democrat, slammed the younger Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s purported scheduling conflicts, responding in a statement: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t allow any entity or individual to dictate how our investigation will proceed or allow anyone to evade a lawful subpoena. No one is above the law, period.\u00e2\u0080\u009d James went to court last month to compel Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business associates, including Eric, to testify and turn over documents as part of an investigation into whether the family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s company, the Trump Organization, lied about the value of its assets in order to get loans or tax benefits. Investigators have yet to determine whether any law was broken, James\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office wrote in a court filing. James sought court intervention after Eric Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyers abruptly canceled an interview with investigators that had been planned for late July. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for next Wednesday in state court in Manhattan. Eric Trump, the third of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s five children, visited a Trump campaign field office in Portsmouth, N.H., on Thursday and also attended an event titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cFighting for Maine Lobster with Eric Trump.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Trumps\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lawyers contend most law-enforcement agencies refrain from actions involving political figures within 60 days before an election, though that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the case when then\u00e2\u0080\u0093FBI Director James Comey sent a letter to Congress a week before the 2016 presidential election regarding the reopening of a probe into Trump rival Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s emails. Eric Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyers have proposed four dates for him to testify, the earliest being Nov. 19, which they contend is just 30 days after others are scheduled to be deposed in the investigation. They are also seeking assurances that the attorney general\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t share testimony and evidence it collects with other law-enforcement agencies or regulators. James launched her civil investigation of potential fraud in Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business dealings in March 2019 after Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s longtime personal lawyer Michael Cohen told Congress that Trump had repeatedly inflated the value of his assets to obtain more favorable terms for loans and insurance coverage. James\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investigators are looking into how the Trump Organization and its agents assessed the value of Seven Springs, a 212-acre estate north of New York City that Trump purchased in 1995 with the intent of turning it into a golf club. After that project failed to progress, he granted an easement over 158 acres to a conservation land trust in 2016 in order to qualify for an income-tax deduction. In its initial court filing, James\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office said a professional appraisal done at the time determined that Seven Springs was worth $56.5 million prior to the donation. The land being conserved in exchange for the tax deduction was worth $21.1 million, it said. Cohen said during his congressional testimony that when Trump was trying to buy the Buffalo Bills in 2014, he provided financial statements to Deutsche Bank saying Seven Springs was worth $291 million in 2012. In his new memoir, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDisloyal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cohen writes that Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vanity also drove valuations. Trump \u00e2\u0080\u009cwould go into a frenzy\u00e2\u0080\u009d when Forbes and Fortune were compiling their annual lists of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s richest people and would have Cohen and longtime financial chief Allen Weisselberg inflate valuations to come up with an acceptable number, Cohen wrote. The attorney general\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office is also attempting to collect information about the Trump National Golf Club near Los Angeles, where the Trump Organization donated a conservation easement over part of the property in 2014 and received a tax deduction. From the archives (2018):Trump Organization finance chief Weisselberg granted immunity in Cohen probe And investigators said they were also probing the circumstances of how the Trump Organization handled tax issues related to more than $100 million of debt related to the Trump International Hotel and Tower Chicago that was forgiven between 2010 and 2012. Investigators said they have not been able to confirm whether any of that forgiven debt was recognized as taxable income, according to the court filings. President Trump last year dismissed various probes into his pre-White House dealings, accusing James and New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo of \u00e2\u0080\u009charassing all of my New York businesses in search of anything at all they can find to make me look as bad as possible.\u00e2\u0080\u009d See:Michael Cohen casts himself as \u00e2\u0080\u0098star witness\u00e2\u0080\u0099 against Trump in new memoir Read on:Michael Cohen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyers sue, claiming he was jailed as retaliation for Trump revelations in book: report"}]}
