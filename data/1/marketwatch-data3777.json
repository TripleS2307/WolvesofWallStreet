LLY, +2.20% gained 0.6% in premarket trading on Wednesday, the day after the National Institutes of Health said it plans to study whether several experimental monoclonal antibodies can treat hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The first therapy to be studied in the Phase 3 randomized, controlled trial is Lilly's LY-CoV555, an antibody that was first detected in a blood sample from a recovered COVID-19 patient. Researchers will evaluate whether the therapy is efficacious in 300 people who have mild or moderate symptoms of COVID-19. Lilly is developing the therapy in partnership with the privately held Abcellera Biologics. Patients in the trial will be given LY-CoV555 or placebo, and all patients will receive the standard of care, which includes Gilead Sciences Inc.'s GILD, +0.82% remdesivir. The Food and Drug Administration granted remdesivir an emergency use authorization in May as a treatment for COVID-19 patients. Lilly announced earlier this week that is testing the investigational antibody treatment in a trial to see if it can prevent COVID-19 infections in residents and workers in nursing homes. Lilly's stock is up 17.8% so far this year, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% has rallied 2.3%."}]}
