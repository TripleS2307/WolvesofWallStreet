The website of the Communist Party\u2019s Global Times said that as of 9 a.m. Wednesday, a total of 1,255 flights to and from the capital\u2019s two major airports have been scrapped. Beijing has enacted a number of measures to limit travel in and out of the city, especially among those coming from districts where new cases have been detected. Beijing had essentially eradicated local transmissions but in recent days has added a total of 137 new cases with no new deaths. On Wednesday, the city raised its threat level from 3 to 2, leading to the cancellation of classes, suspension of plans for opening up and stiffened requirements for social distancing. No official public notice on a change in regulations has been issued by China\u2019s civil aviation authority or by either Beijing Capital Airport \u2014 traditionally the world\u2019s second busiest handling more than 101 million passengers \u2014 or Beijing Daxing International Airport.
