The U.S. counted 34,700 new confirmed cases on Wednesday, according to the Associated Press, the highest level since a late April peak number of 36,400. While New York and neighboring states have succeeded in flattening their infection curve, 29 states are still seeing increasing cases over the last 14 days, according to a New York Times tracker. California, Texas and Florida are leading the pack, while Arizona, California, Mississippi, Nevada, Texas and Oklahoma have set records for number of new cases in a single day this week. Other states, including North Carolina and South Carolina, have seen their highest rate of hospitalizations. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott paused the reopening of the state in response to the spike in cases of COVID-19 and hospitalizations. Businesses that were allowed reopen under previous phases of reopening can still operate at the designated capacity levels and under health protocols provided by the Texas Department of State Health Services, he said Thursday. The pandemic is still very much alive in other parts of the world too. In Brazil, Mexico, India, Iran, Colombia, Iraq, South Africa and Bangladesh, the 5-day average of new cases is still up, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. Countries that appeared to successfully contain the spread of the virus are also seeing resurgences as they reopen and lift lockdowns. Europe saw an increase last week for the first time in months, according to World Health Organization\u2019s Hans Kluge, regional director for Europe. Thirty countries have seen increases in new cumulative cases over the past two weeks, Kluge told Agence France-Presse. \u201c In 11 of these countries, accelerated transmission has led to very significant resurgence that if left unchecked, will push health systems to the brink once again in Europe,\u201d Kluge said. Germany, which was widely admired for its successful approach to the crisis and for having far fewer cases and fatalities than neighbors, suffered a setback this week, when it had to reimpose lockdowns in two districts after an outbreak at a slaughterhouse.

At least 4.8 million people have recovered. The U.S. leads the world with a case tally of 2.39 million and death toll of 122,177. The CDC said Thursday that an estimated 20 million Americans, about 6% of the population, have likely been infected with COVID-19, according to a nationally representative survey it conducted using blood samples. This figure, which takes into account asymptomatic people and those who were sickened but did not get tested for COVID-19, is more than eight times larger than the estimated 2.3 million tests that have been performed in the U.S. See also:Big pharma is taking big money from U.S. taxpayers to find a coronavirus vaccine \u2014 and charge whatever they want for it The U.S. numbers are more than double the next highest totals, Brazil\u2019s 1.19 million cases and 53,830 deaths. Russia is third in cases with 613,148 and 8,594 deaths, followed by India with 473,105 and 14,894 fatalities. The U.K. has 309,455 cases and 43,314 fatalities, the highest in Europe and third highest in the world. China, where the illness was first reported late last year, has 84,673 cases and 4,640 fatalities.What\u2019s the latest medical news? The race to create a COVID-19 vaccine has upended the traditional drug development process, and health officials and drug makers are trying to hasten the time it takes to find a working vaccine, in part by moving forward with manufacturing plans even before the vaccine candidates prove their safety or efficacy, as MarketWatch\u2019s Jaimy Lee reported. \u201cThe pandemic response is different,\u201d said Joseph Kim, CEO of Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc. INO, -1.36%, which has said it plans to have a millions of doses of its vaccine candidate by the end of this year. \u201cWe\u2019re doing all these things in parallel.\u201d See also:Why virus stocks are driving market volatility Inovio said Tuesday that the Department of Defense has awarded it $71 million to fund development of its vaccine candidate. The company is expected to release data from a Phase 1 clinical trial in the next week. Making this kind of change is what enables government officials like Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, to say repeatedly that it\u2019s possible to have a viable COVID-19 vaccine within a year of the coronavirus first coming to the attention of the U.S. government. Trump administration officials have said they aim to have a vaccine by January as part of Operation Warp Speed. See also:Researchers publish dexamethasone findings \u201cAlthough you can never guarantee at all the safety and efficacy of a vaccine until you actually test it in the field, we feel cautiously optimistic based on the concerted effort and the fact that we are taking financial risks,\u201d Fauci testified during a Committee on Energy and Commerce hearing on Tuesday, \u201cnot risks to safety, not risk to the integrity of the science, but financial risks to be able to be ahead of the game.\u201d Moderna Inc. MRNA, +0.09% , meanwhile, said that Catalent Inc. CTLT, +1.90% will handle vial filling and packaging for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate if it proves to be safe and efficacious. That news sent both stocks higher in early trade. What\u2019s the economy saying? New applications for traditional jobless benefits fell slightly last week to 1.48 million, but they remain stubbornly high three months after the start of the coronavirus pandemic and signal that a fledging economic recovery is likely to be uneven, as MarketWatch\u2019s Jeffry Bartash reported. Initial jobless claims, a rough gauge of layoffs, dipped in the seven days ended June 20 from 1.54 million in the prior week, the Labor Department said Thursday. The figures are seasonally adjusted. While it marked the 12th straight decline, new claims are still extremely high and raise questions about whether a small rebound in the economy, after a prolonged coronavirus-tied shutdown, is about to hit a wall. Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast a seasonally adjusted 1.38 million new claims. These figures reflect applications filed the normal way through state unemployment offices. See also: U.S. entered recession in February after end of longest expansion in history, NBER finds If people who applied for benefits through a temporary federal program are included, new claims totaled an unadjusted 2.19 million last week. That was down slightly from a revised 2.2 million. \u201cThe concern is what the July and later months could show, given still high initial claims and rising Covid-19 case counts in many states\u201d wrote economists Andrew Grantham and Katherine Judge of CIBC Capital Markets. See:MarketWatch\u2019s Coronavirus Recovery Tracker The Commerce Department released its final estimate for first-quarter GDP and stuck with a 5% pace of contraction as previously estimated. Federal Reserve officials and private-sector economists have forecast an unprecedented contraction in GDP in the April-June quarter. Economists surveyed by MarketWatch expect a decline at a 29.5% annual rate. The data will be released on July 30. A separate report found the U.S. trade deficit in goods widened 5.1% in May as exports fell sharply. The gap in goods widened to $74.3 billion in May from a revised $70.7 billion in the prior month. That is a much wider than the $66.5 billion estimate of economists polled by MarketWatch. Exports of goods dropped $5.5 billion to $90.1 in May. Imports fell $1.9 billion to $164.4 billion. The report also showed a 1.2% decline in wholesale inventories in May, and advanced retail inventories were down 6.1%. Excluding autos, retail inventories were down 1.5%.What are companies saying? Macy\u2019s Inc. M, -0.95% is cutting 3,900 workers in its latest cost reduction effort because of the impact of the pandemic. The news disappointed investors, coming after a recent announcement from the department-store chain that reopened stores were performing strongly. There was better news from Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants Inc. DRI, -1.34%, which reported narrower-than-expected losses for its fiscal fourth quarter and sales that beat expectations. The company, which also owns LongHorn Steakhouse and The Capital Grille, saw big declines in same-restaurant sales, but trends are improving as more outlets reopen and the company is generating positive operating cash flow. \u201cAs our industry continues to rebuild, there is significant opportunity to increase market share,\u201d said Gene Lee, Darden\u2019s chief executive, in a statement. Spice and condiment maker McCormick & Co. Inc. MKC, +0.91% reported better-than-expected earnings for its fiscal second quarter, buoyed by an increase in at-home dining. Here are the latest things companies have said about COVID-19: \u2022 Ally Financial Inc. ALLY, -0.21% Cardholder Management Services Inc. (CardWorks) agreed to call off their merger deal, because of the \u201cunprecedented economic and market conditions\u201d resulting from the pandemic. \u201c [CardWorks CEO] Don Berman and I, along with our boards of directors, believe it is in the best interests of our customers and stakeholders to terminate the agreement,\u201d Ally Chief Executive Jeffrey J. Brown said in a statement. \u2022 Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.74% is temporarily re-closing seven stores in the Houston area amid a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in Texas. The company is temporarily shutting its Highland Village, First Colony Mall, Houston Galleria, Memorial City, Willowbrook Mall, Baybrook, and Woodlands locations \u201cwith an abundance of caution\u201d given \u201ccurrent COVID-19 conditions in some of the communities we serve.\u201d The move comes after Apple last week moved to temporarily shut some locations in Florida, Arizona, North Carolina, and South Carolina, according to reports. Apple was among the first to shutter locations outside of China in March as the pandemic worsened, though the company has been gradually reopening stores with some restrictions on in-store activities. \u2022 CEC Entertainment Inc., the parent of Chuck E. Cheese and Peter Piper Pizza, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, weighed down by restaurant closures during the pandemic. The company will use the time to continue talks with its financial stakeholders, including landlords, to \u201cachieve a comprehensive balance sheet restructuring that supports its reopening and longer-term strategic plans.\u201d As of June 24, 266 company-operated restaurant and arcade venues had reopened for business. The company is expecting to keep these venues open through Chapter 11 and to offer dine-in, delivery and take-out services. The company\u2019s non-U.S. franchise partners and corporate entities are not included in the process. \u2022 Chico\u2019s FAS Inc. CHS, +12.50% will return its executives to full pay effective July 5 after putting wage cuts in place as a cost-saving measure during the pandemic. Executive pay was halved starting April 5. The decision comes as stores begin to reopen and sales start to improve. Other compensation has been restored as well, including the board\u2019s annual cash retainers and non-furloughed employees, except for distribution center workers who never experienced a pay cut. Chico\u2019s portfolio includes the namesake chain of women\u2019s apparel stores, White House Black Market and Soma. \u2022 KB Home KBH, +1.89% reported a huge drop in housing orders because of the pandemic while turning in an earnings beat. Gross orders fell 4% in March, 59% in April, and 42% in May, as customers canceled orders due to the pandemic. Easing of shelter-in-place restrictions, however, are resulting in an uptick, the company said, noting that gross orders for the first three weeks of June are up 4% from a year ago. \u2022 Macy\u2019s is cutting 3,900 workers across corporate and management roles, as well as store staff, supply chain employees and the customer service network due to the impact of COVID-19. The restructuring is a cost-cutting effort as the department store retailer recovers from the pandemic. \u201cWhile the reopening of our stores is going well, we do anticipate a gradual recovery of business, and we are taking action to align our cost base with our anticipated lower sales,\u201d said CEO Jeff Gennette. \u201cOur lower cost base combined with the approximately $4.5 billion in new financing will also make us a more stable, flexible company.\u201d Macy\u2019s expects to save $365 million in fiscal 2020, and $630 million on an annualized basis. Restructuring costs are expected to be $180 million. Macy\u2019s had 123,000 workers as of February 1; many were furloughed at the end of March. Most of the remaining furloughed staff will return to work on July 5. \u2022 MGM Resorts International MGM, -2.59% will require that guests wear face masks inside public spaces at all of its U.S. outlets effective Friday, as it moves to upgrade safety measures during the pandemic. Previously, the casino operator only required employees to wear masks. The U.S. recorded a one-day total of 34,700 new confirmed COVID-19 cases on Wednesday, the highest level since late April, when the number peaked at 36,400, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. \u201cIt is clear that the coronavirus still presents a significant public health threat, and masks have proven to be one of the best ways to curtail the spread,\u201d MGM said in a statement. \u2022 Rite Aid Corp. RAD, -2.04% reported a narrower-than-expected fiscal first-quarter loss and revenue that rose more than forecast. Retail pharmacy sales rose 6.6%, as front-end sales increased 14.2% and pharmacy sales grew 2.2%. Excluding cigarettes, front-end same-store sales increased 16.0%, amid strength in sales of cleaning products, sanitizers, wipes, paper products, liquor, over-the-counter products and summer seasonal items. The company has withdrawn its fiscal 2021 guidance issued in March, given the uncertainties about the potential impact of the pandemic. \u2022 The Walt Disney Co. DIS, +1.53% is delaying the reopening of its California theme parks, including Disneyland, which had been scheduled to start reopening July 17. \u201cGiven the time required for us to bring thousands of cast members back to work and restart our business, we have no choice but to delay the reopening of our theme parks and resort hotels until we receive approval from government officials,\u201d Disney said. It did not give a new reopening date, but said the state of California does not plan to update its guidelines on theme parks until after July 4. \u201cOnce we have a clearer understanding of when guidelines will be released, we expect to be able to communicate a reopening date,\u201d the company said. Disney still must negotiate with its unions before reopening, but union members have been critical of the company\u2019s \u201crapid timetable\u201d to reopen, especially considering the recent spike in coronavirus cases in Southern California.
