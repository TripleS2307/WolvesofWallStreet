During the hearing, the National Institutes of Health said it will spend about $250 million to support development of new tests that the government agency says will help increase the \"number, type, and availability of tests by millions per week.\" The U.S. has conducted more than 54.6 million tests; however, there are still anecdotes about lagging wait times for test results."}]}
