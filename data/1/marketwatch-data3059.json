Day trading could be right for you if: \u2022 You have money to burn, and \u2022 You hope (against all odds) to turn its ashes into riches, and \u2022 You love the prospect of getting into deep financial trouble. But even if you satisfy those three conditions, I hope you\u2019ll consider donating your money (which you\u2019ll probably lose otherwise) to a reputable cause instead. The Times article described some ultra-risky trading behavior that\u2019s been happening with Robinhood, an app that offers commission-free trading in stocks, ETFs, and options. The article had a subhead saying that these traders \u201cbuy and sell the riskiest financial products and do so more frequently than customers at other retail brokerage firms, but their inexperience can lead to staggering losses.\u201d Apparently this platform can turn the activity of trading stocks into an easy one-click \u201cgame\u201d that results in huge volumes of trades, often including risky options contracts. Worse, the article details how some customers did all this on borrowed money. The average customer is 31 years old, and half of them are first-time investors, according to the story. Compounding the trouble these traders face, the company\u2019s website has been unreliable, the Times reported. One version of its software reversed the direction of trades initiated by its customers, giving them the opposite of the result they were seeking. \u201cThey make it so easy for people that don\u2019t know anything about stocks,\u201d one customer told the newspaper. \u201cThen you go there and you start to lose money.\u201d That could be an extreme understatement. I think that particular customer bears some responsibility in the matter. According to the article, he funded his trading with $15,000 in credit-card advances plus two home-equity loans totaling $60,000. In March, he lost $860,000. When I read about this, one of my first thoughts was: \u201cWow! John Bogle must be spending long hours rolling over in his grave.\u201d This isn\u2019t the only company encouraging trading. A popular consumer technology blog runs frequent ads that offer \u201cfree live training\u2026How to know 72 hours in advance which stocks to pick.\u201d The fine print (gray lettering over a black background) warns of \u201csubstantial risk of loss\u201d and advises: \u201cDon\u2019t trade with money you can\u2019t afford to lose.\u201dThe rules of investing \u2014 and common sense Although you, dear reader, are undoubtedly too savvy to fall for such things, I think this calls for a review of some basic lessons every investor should know. Don\u2019t take it just from me. Here\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s BRK.A, +0.06% Warren Buffett, who isn\u2019t a fan of frequent trading: \u2022 \u201cOur favorite holding period is forever\u2026Our stay-put behavior reflects our view that the stock market serves as a relocation center at which money is moved from the active to the patient.\u201d \u2022 Here\u2019s another Buffet gem: \u201cInactivity strikes us as intelligent behavior.\u201d Many young people think they\u2019re smart enough to ignore the advice of old timers like Buffett, Vanguard\u2019s Bogle, and Paul Merriman. But Buffett, one of the world\u2019s richest individuals and who is certainly no dummy, said this: \u2022 \u201cOnce you have ordinary intelligence, what you need is the temperament to control the urges that get other people in trouble investing.\u201d Bogle didn\u2019t think much of trading either: \u2022 \u201cThe idea that a bell rings to signal when investors should get into or out of the market is simply not credible. After nearly 50 years in this business, I do not know of anybody who has done it successfully and consistently.\u201d In 2015, Bogle said annual stock trading in recent years averaged about $30 trillion\u2026while only about $250 billion went into new businesses, new technology, medical breakthroughs, and modernizing plants and equipment. In other words, more than 99% of the activity on Wall Street essentially amounts to speculation, \u201cpushing poker chips around the table,\u201d with less than 1% aimed at \u201ccreating new poker chips.\u201d That\u2019s a sad commentary on this huge industry. I have a couple more Bogle quotes to share, but let\u2019s see what stock traders themselves have to say. According to his website, Daily Price Action, Justin Bennett is \u201can internationally recognized Forex trader with 10+ years of experience. He\u2019s been interviewed by Stocks & Commodities Magazine as a featured trader for the month and is mentioned weekly by Forex Factory\u2026Justin created Daily Price Action in 2014 and has since grown the monthly readership to over 100,000 Forex traders and has personally mentored more than 3,000 students.\u201d Sounds like somebody who knows trading. Bennett had this to say recently: \u2022 \u201cAt the end of the day, every time you buy or sell, there is someone out there doing the exact opposite.\u201d Here are three more quotes worth sharing with anybody you might know who\u2019s tempted by the \u201ceasy money\u201d that is supposedly available from trading: \u2022 Bogle: \u201cTime is your friend. Impulse is your enemy.\u201d \u2022 Bogle (I\u2019m paraphrasing): Wall Street profits from the advice \u201cDon\u2019t just stand there, do something!\u201d Investors, on the other hand, profit from the advice \u201cDon\u2019t do something. Just stand there!\u201d \u2022 Michael Lewis, author of \u201cLiar\u2019s Poker\u201d: \u201cThe men on the trading floor may not have been to school, but they have Ph.D.\u2019s in man\u2019s ignorance.\u201d \u2022 Back to Buffett: \u201cYou only have to do a very few things right so long as you don\u2019t do too many things wrong.\u201d Everything I know tells me that day trading qualifies as one of the really \u201cwrong\u201d things investors can do. For some investing perspective, check out my latest video, \u201cThe past, present, and future of investing.\u201d Richard Buck contributed to this article."}]}
