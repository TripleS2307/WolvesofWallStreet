The increase comes after pending home sales experienced the largest monthly rise on record last month, the trade group said. Compared with a year ago, contract signings were up 6.3%, a sign of how sharply the market has rebounded from its coronavirus-related low. \u201cIt is quite surprising and remarkable that, in the midst of a global pandemic, contract activity for home purchases is higher compared to one year ago,\u201d Lawrence Yun, the National Association of Realtors\u2019 chief economist, said in the report. \u201cConsumers are taking advantage of record-low mortgage rates resulting from the Federal Reserve\u2019s maximum liquidity monetary policy.\u201d The index measures real-estate transactions where a contract was signed for a previously-owned homes but the sale had not yet closed, benchmarked to contract-signing activity in 2001. What happened: Every region experienced a monthly increase in pending home sales, led by the Northeast (up 54.4%). However, the Northeast was the only region that did not experience a year-over-year uptick in contract signings, a reflection of the longer pandemic-related lockdowns in those states. The trade group now expects that existing-home sales will only drop by 3% for all of 2020. The big picture: The continued rebound in pending home sales suggests that the real-estate market is thriving in spite of the continued rise in COVID-19 cases across the country. Two main factors are driving the surge in home-buying activity. Many buyers appear to be entering the market looking to make up for lost time \u2014 as such, the rise in sales is a reflection of the delays caused by the coronavirus outbreak. The low mortgage rate environment has also created a sense of urgency among Americans looking to purchase a home and lock in an attractive interest rate. Nevertheless, headwinds remain for the nation\u2019s housing market. There\u2019s still a shortage of homes available for sale, and some sellers continue to stay on the side lines rather than list their properties. The supply situation will inherently limit how many deals can close. \u201cThe impacts of social distancing seem to have more lasting impacts on supply, as new listings remain well below the 2019 levels despite the resurgence of demand we saw in May and June,\u201d said Ruben Gonzalez, chief economist at real-estate brokerage Keller Williams. And while low mortgage rates are popular, if they stay this low for an extended period of time, the novelty will likely wear off, experts say. Once Americans get used to sub-3% rates, they may not act as the same catalyst driving sales volumes as they are now, Realtor.com chief economist Danielle Hale told MarketWatch when the 30-year mortgage dropped below 3% on average for the first time earlier in July. Finally, coronavirus cases have continued to increase across much of the country throughout the summer, including in Sunbelt states with some of the largest real-estate markets in the country. It\u2019s not fully clear yet how that rise in cases may affect consumer confidence and people\u2019s interest in buying a home in those areas. And the quick adoption of virtual home-showing technology across the real-estate industry should stave off some of the negative effects from the rise in COVID-19 cases, Gonzalez said. What they\u2019re saying: \u201dThe numbers tend to trend broadly in line with mortgage applications, which have fully recovered from their COVID-induced drop in the early spring,\u201d Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a research note.
