NVDA, -0.54% and Intel Corp. INTC, -1.03% to equal weight from overweight Tuesday, writing that he's shifting his chip-sector preferences toward names that stand to benefit from a broader economic recovery. He previously showed a preference for stocks that could benefit from remote-working trends. Nvidia shares are off 0.6% in Tuesday morning trading while Intel shares are up 1.7%. Moore wrote that in a recent Nvidia note, he drew comparisons between Nvidia and high-growth software names to justify his price target. \"As much as we like the longer-term growth story, that's simply not a comparison that we're totally comfortable with,\" he said. On Intel, Moore wrote that consensus estimates seem low for the second-half of this year but \"the growth deceleration implied by consensus numbers does imply significant risk to CY21.\" He upgraded shares of Lam Research Corp. LRCX, +2.04%, Qualcomm Inc. QCOM, +2.06%, and Qorvo Inc. [s QRVO] to overweight from equal weight. Nvidia shares have added 84% over the past three months as Intel's stock has rallied 38%. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% is up 32% in that time as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56%, of which Intel is a component, is up 31%."}]}
