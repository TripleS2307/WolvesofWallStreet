Why wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t anyone held accountable?", "body": "RJ Infusino is still paying down the student debt he took on to attend a college that collapsed. When RJ Infusino enrolled at the Illinois Institute of Art\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Schaumburg campus in 2015 after graduating high school, he thought he was starting on the path to a career in audio production.\u00c2 \u00c2 Even when his experience wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite what he expected \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the campus consisted of a few floors in an office park, instructors would sometimes show up extremely late to class \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Infusino pressed on, thinking he could at least use the experience and equipment to learn skills that would help him land a job. And the school was promising to help set him up for a career.\u00c2 Then one day in 2017, with less than a year left to graduate, officials announced that the school had been sold to an organization Infusino had never heard of. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt the time, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m crazy stressed, trying to look at jobs, trying to look at things going forward,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Infusino, 24, recalled.\u00c2 What he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know was that the sale of the for-profit Art Institute\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campus to the Dream Center Foundation, a Los Angeles-based religious nonprofit with no experience in higher education, had cost the school its accreditation. That meant that any credits Infusino earned during the period the accreditation was in limbo would be difficult to transfer.\u00c2 Six months after the school lost accreditation, all students, including Infusino, learned for the first time that the school was not accredited and that it would close, according to court documents. To Infusino, who needed just three more quarters of classes to earn his degree, the school\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shutdown was abrupt. But court documents allege that the school\u00e2\u0080\u0099s executives knew for months that it was in financial trouble and would likely need to close. Infusino continued his education at one of the few institutions where his credits would transfer, another for-profit college based in Florida, where he studied online. But the Art Institute\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shutdown set him back nearly a year in pursuit of his bachelor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s degree, spitting him out into the job market just as COVID-19-related shutdown orders were taking effect.\u00c2 He still owes roughly $24,000 in student loans and is working as a gymnastics coach, a job he held while he was in school. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI only make roughly $21,000 a year,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow am I supposed to pay all that off and pay all my other bills on top of that? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s insane.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Meanwhile, the executives who allegedly knew of the school\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accreditation challenges haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t faced any financial consequences,\u00c2 even though the U.S. Department of Education has the authority to hold them accountable, a new report from the Student Legal Defense Network argues. In addition, Congressional Democrats have alleged that officials at the Department of Education took \u00e2\u0080\u009cextraordinary measures\u00e2\u0080\u009d that allowed Dream Center to continue to receive federal financial-aid funds during the period when its accreditation was in limbo.\u00c2 Now, Dream Center Educational Holdings, the organization Dream Center formed to buy Art Institutes and other colleges is in receivership, a status similar to bankruptcy.\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just absolute garbage how easily they can take advantage of someone like me who genuinely wants to work hard at developing a career in the industry that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interested in,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2 Infusino said.\u00c2 \u00c2 Attorneys for Dream Center Educational Holdings didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t immediately respond to a request for comment. The Department of Education didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t immediately provide a comment.The feds have had the authority to hold executives accountable since 1992, a new report argues Attorneys from the National Student Legal Defense Network, an organization representing students in lawsuits surrounding the collapse of Dream Center Education Holdings\u00e2\u0080\u0099 schools, argue the government has the tools to hold such executives accountable. In a report released Monday , the attorneys write that the Department of Education has had this authority since 1992, but the agency, under presidents of both parties, hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t used it successfully. The paper is part of a set of proposals from Student Defense that the organization says a new Department of Education could tackle in its first 100 days. When schools collapse amid wrongdoing, it can be costly to the government. For one, federal student-loan borrowers are entitled to be made whole in these cases. In addition, students who are attending the school at or near the time of closure have the right to have their federal student loans discharged. In the report, the attorneys argue that the owners and executives of these schools can be held personally liable for those lost funds.\u00c2 When \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou look at what the extent of the liabilities are that taxpayers have the burden of now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d related to for-profit college closures, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbillions of dollars have gone out the door and those dollars are not recovered,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dan Zibel, one of the authors of the paper and the vice president and chief counsel at Student Defense.\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cCongress, in the early 1990s was very clear in adding these personal liability provisions for this exact reason that when schools close or otherwise fail to meet that responsibility to students, the owners are left to profit and taxpayers and students are left to pay the bill,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\u00c2 The idea laid out in the National Student Legal Defense Network\u00e2\u0080\u0099s report appears to have bipartisan support among voters. When asked as part of a poll commissioned by Student Defense whether the Department of Education should hold executives personally liable for wrongdoing, 78% of 3,199 of likely voters in swing states said they agreed or strongly agreed with the proposal.\u00c2 The idea also has backing from a prominent lawmaker. In a statement released with the paper, Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, criticized the role of \u00e2\u0080\u009cpredatory for-profit colleges\u00e2\u0080\u009d whose executives and owners \u00e2\u0080\u009cgot filthy rich off of taxpayer dollars with zero accountability,\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more than $1.5 trillion student loan problem.\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need a Department of Education that will end this boondoggle, protect students, cancel fraudulent student debt, and, as Student Defense\u00e2\u0080\u0099s report shows, use every tool available to hold college executives and owners who defraud students personally accountable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Warren wrote in the statement.\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u0098History clearly repeats itself\u00e2\u0080\u0099 The report notes that as part of the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act in 1992, Congress granted the Department of Education the authority to recover financial losses from individuals who \u00e2\u0080\u009cexercise substantial control over [an] institution.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The provision came in the wake of an investigation and hearings, led by then-Georgia Senator Sam Nunn, a Democrat, on fraud and abuses in federal financial aid.\u00c2 The investigation uncovered evidence of colleges with robust recruiting operations and little educational infrastructure in some cases targeting homeless shelters to lure prospective students \u00e2\u0080\u0094 echoes of some of the accusations leveled against for-profit colleges today. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHistory clearly repeats itself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Zibel said.\u00c2 \u00c2 Over the past several years, multiple large for-profit college chains have collapsed, including most prominently Corinthian Colleges and ITT Technical Institutes, costing taxpayers at least hundreds of millions of dollars, but the Department of Education hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t held their executives liable. Zibel admits that when he was at the agency, working as the deputy assistant general counsel for postsecondary education, they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take that step.\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen the liabilities grow as student debt has grown and as costs have grown,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Zibel said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt seems like the Department needs to take a new look at this.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2 The agency has used its authority to try to collect from schools themselves in cases of abrupt closure amid fraud. But if a school disappears before the feds get their money, the liability still exists. Holding executives personally responsible for those losses could be a way to recover those funds, the report argues. (The agency does have the authority to hold executives and owners responsible even when the school they operated still exists, the paper argues).\u00c2 The Department of Justice has the ability to take the owners to court. In addition, the government, through the Treasury Department, uses extraordinary collection powers, including garnishing Social Security benefits, tax refunds and wages, to collect when a borrower defaults on a student loan.\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese same tools could be equally at play,\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the case of former college owners or executives, Zibel said.\u00c2 Other federal agencies have settled with college executives over alleged harm to investors Other government agencies have taken steps to hold for-profit college executives accountable. The leaders of Corinthian and ITT settled with the Securities and Exchange Commission over accusations they misled investors.\u00c2 \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098Those are for harms that they caused to investors. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a clear connection to protecting students and students are suffering here.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Dan Zibel, vice president and chief counsel at Student Defense. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThose are for harms that they caused to investors,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Zibel said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a clear connection to protecting students and students are suffering here. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve caused harm to students.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2 Infusino said he hates thinking about the way he was targeted and taken advantage of by his former school, but continues to share his experience \u00e2\u0080\u0094 whether as part of lawsuits, in front of lawmakers or in the media \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in hopes that he can help prevent similar situations from happening in the future.\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cI coach kids, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want them to grow up in a world where this can happen to them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want them to go to school and not think about whether or not they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re being swindled.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}]}
