Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell announced changes to the central bank\u2019s policy framework in a speech at the Jackson Hole economic symposium that were perceived as offering a more accommodative monetary policy, and bullish for bullion buyers in the long run. However, the policy change was largely expected and analysts said some investors resorted to profit taking in the wake of the speech. In a statement, the Fed said that it has adopted an \u201caverage inflation target\u201d and recognizes the benefits for a strong labor market. The Fed\u2019s strategy retains 2% annual inflation as a target but the Fed said it \u201cseeks to achieve inflation that averages 2% over time.\u201d Read:Fed unanimously adopts new strategy, widely seen as leading to easier policy \u201cIt is hard to overstate the benefits of sustaining a strong labor market, a key national goal,\u201d Powell said in his prepared remarks discussing the policy shift. Gold traders already knew the speech would mention inflation, and gold prices initially moved higher, climbing by more than $30 an ounce, in the initial wake of the speech, Jim Wyckoff, senior analyst at Kitco.com, told MarketWatch. Prices then got pulled lower as traders \u201cdiscounted\u201d Powell\u2019s speech since it wasn\u2019t fresh news, he said. The important thing is that the \u201coverall marketplace [is] shifting to more inflation,\u201d said Wyckoff, which prices for many commodities moving higher. It\u2019s a change in psychology \u201cfrom one of price deflation being an issue in the past 10 years\u201d to now one of persistent central bank monetary policy stimulus leading to potential problematic price inflation. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s going to continue to lift precious metals prices.\u201d Looking ahead to next week, Wyckoff expected to see \u201csideways to higher price action.\u201d On Thursday, December gold GCZ20, +2.17% GC00, +2.17% fell $19.90, or 1%, to settle at $1,932.60 an ounce. Prices traded as low as $1,914.70, but also as high as $1,987 during the session. Prices rose 1.5% Wednesday to finish that day at around a one-week high. \u201cGold has had a nice move since the consolidation between April and June, so I think it\u2019s healthy for it to pull back, digest, and consolidate further here,\u201d said Adam Koos, president of Libertas Wealth Management Group. \u201c I would like gold \u2018to see another 2 weeks of sideways movement, after which I expect it to head to new, all-time-highs by the end of the year.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Adam Koos, Libertas Wealth Management Group \u201cWhile I\u2019m out of the yellow metal for now, I\u2019m watching it daily, and would like to see another 2 weeks of sideways movement, after which I expect it to head to new, all-time-highs by the end of the year,\u201d he said. The most likely catalysts for that move higher would be further weakness in the U.S. dollar \u201cand investors using the trade as a safe haven for the uncertainties that will arrive closer to (and after) the Presidential election.\u201d September silver US:SIU20, meanwhile, lost 42 cents, or 1.5%, at $27.025 an ounce, after surging 4.4% on Wednesday, also marking its highest settlement in about a week. In the coming days, the market will be picking apart the Fed\u2019s new strategy, and that \u201cthis is likely to continue to drive gold-price volatility,\u201d Cailin Birch, global economist at The Economist Intelligence Unit, told MarketWatch. Meanwhile, traders parsed the latest economic data, with new applications for U.S. jobless benefits down again in late August to just above 1 million and resumed a downward trend, perhaps signaling the resumption of a gradual if painfully slow recovery in the U.S. labor market. Initial jobless claims, a rough gauge of layoffs, declined by 98,000 to 1 million from 1.1 million in the prior week, the Labor Department said Thursday. Meanwhile, a historic decline in U.S. 2nd-quarter gross domestic product was revised to 31.7% annual rate from 32.9%. Among other metals Thursday, December copper HGZ20, +1.38%, which is now the most active, settled at $2.9905 a pound, up 0.3%. October platinum PLV20, +3.99% lost 1.% to $928.10 an ounce, while the most-active December palladium contract PAZ20, +2.31% shed 1% to $2,190.50 an ounce."}]}
