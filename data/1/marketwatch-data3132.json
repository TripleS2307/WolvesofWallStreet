This comes as the state has registered a new low point in the number of COVID-19 fatalities since the pandemic began in March. New York state has gone from the deadly U.S. epicenter of the pandemic to a state with enviable statistics as the virus continues to spread across the country. There were just 10 recorded deaths from the virus on Sunday and 15 on Saturday, according to Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s office, by far the lowest numbers since the start of the crisis in March. Of the more than 50,000 tests conducted statewide on Sunday, just 0.97% came back positive for COVID-19. In New York City, the rate of positives was 1.1%. Meanwhile, both subway ridership and vehicle traffic have increased in New York City in advance of Phase 2. Subway ridership increased 29% between June 4-8, said Mayor Bill de Blasio, while bus ridership is up 22%, and traffic on the East River bridge is up 24%. \u201cPeople are seeing that safety and health are being taken seriously, and they\u2019re responding to it,\u201d the mayor said Monday. Reopened offices will be limited to 50% of their usual capacity, and customers entering retail stores will be required to wear masks and maintain a 6-foot distance from others. Restaurants are currently restricted to outdoor seating as part of the city\u2019s Open Restaurants initiative, which allows them to seat dine-in customers in backyards and on patios, sidewalks, and curb lanes.

All told, New York City is estimated to have around 25,000 restaurants, cafes and bars.

In a news conference Monday morning, de Blasio demurred on questions about slowing down the pace of reopening in New York City to account for heightened density and risk. Mid-Hudson Valley (which includes Westchester, Dutchess and Rockland counties) is scheduled to begin Phase 3 Tuesday, and Long Island is expected to enter it on Wednesday. \u201cTwo weeks is the official minimum, but the state\u2019s always been clear and I\u2019ve always been clear that we\u2019re going to judge by the data and look at the particular complexities of New York City,\u201d de Blasio said. \u201cI\u2019ll hold out hope that we can move through it quickly, but it\u2019s going to be based on the data. And it\u2019s a high bar, because to do something here, affects so many people. We have to get it right.\u201d The city\u2019s Test and Trace program continues to expand, and has identified 7,500 cases across the city so far, preventing an estimated 2,000 further cases through contact tracing and providing support to help New Yorkers quarantine, including delivery of food, medication, and other supplies. In addition to restaurants, Phase 2 allows for the limited reopening of hair salons and barbershops; in-store retail; offices; houses of worship; real estate services; and car sales and rental dealerships."}]}
