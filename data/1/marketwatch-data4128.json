But you may be overthinking it, according to one longtime market watcher. \u00e2\u0080\u009c2020 is just like 2009,\u00e2\u0080\u009d wrote Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, in a note out Tuesday. Colas has been tracking the 2009-2020 analogy ever since the March mayhem, and the similarities have been uncanny. If the comparison holds, he writes, we should expect a period of stagnation, and then a late-year rally. But first, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a recap of where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been since March. As of 58 days after the low of March 23, 2020, the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% \u00c2 is 37.1% higher. In 2009, the low came on March 9, and 58 days later, the index was 39.4% higher. Oddly, Colas notes, in 2020, stocks have twice tried to break away to the upside from the 2009 experience, but failed both times. The first was on April 14, when the 2020 rally got ahead of 2009 by 11 points (+27.2% from the lows vs. 16.4% in 2009). Stocks then gave up all those gains in the next 5 days. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe second was just last Monday, when the index was 13 points ahead of the 2009 rally, and you know what happened next: Thursday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 6% drop and other declines have closed the gap again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Colas writes. The parallels between the two periods are all the more striking because of how different the stock market has become, he noted. Among other things, valuations are higher: the S&P 500 currently trades 19.6x recent peak earnings of $155 a share, compared with 10.4x peak earnings, in 2009. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in part because technology makes up a much greater share of the index now: 32%, compared with 18.4% in 2009. Energy also represents a much smaller share of the overall market: 3% versus 12.4% a decade ago. (Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an earlier piece about DataTrek research on what the prevalence of tech means for valuations.) And while financials rocketed higher in 2009 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u009c2009\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rally was primarily a sigh of relief regarding the survival of the US financial system,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Colas says \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the 2020 rebound, like the fears that brought the stock market to its knees in March, have been much broader-based. See: Coronavirus was the perfect storm for tech innovation, and this fund manager made out What next? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible, as Colas puts it, to imagine 2020 as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cturbocharged\u00e2\u0080\u009d version of 2009, since both fiscal and monetary stimulus have been far more robust. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s equally possible that the problems are much more severe. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe COVID Crisis is much more far reaching than the Financial Crisis,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he writes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn 2009 we wondered if bank ATMs would have cash. Now we wonder if touching an ATM is safe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ultimately, though, Colas thinks investors may be overthinking things. This time may in fact not be all that different, especially since the 2009 roadmap has worked so well so far. If so, Colas writes, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe S&P 500 is set for a breather.\u00e2\u0080\u009d From Day 58 of 2009\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rally, the index \u00e2\u0080\u009cdidn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go anywhere for 34 trading days (seven weeks.)\u00e2\u0080\u009d The rest of 2009 made up for it, however, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwith a 17% rally from late July through year end. If history repeats itself that would put the S&P at 3,588 on December 31st, for an 11.1% price gain on the year.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And the dominance of technology in 2020 helps offset some of the bigger unknowns, he argues.
