The company went public in early July at $29, and promptly soared 139% in its trading debut, marking the best first-day performance of an IPO in 2020. The stock was last trading down 7.6% at $72.90. Goldman analysts led by Heath Terry said the company is a fast growing disrupter in the property & casualty insurance sector, using AI and data to grow market share and eventually drive profitability. However, \"with 140% y/y gross earned premium growth in the most recent quarter, ~5 years of expected operating losses before reaching breakeven, and significant capital needs beyond the most recent IPO, LMND is essentially venture investing in the public markets,\" the analysts wrote in a note to clients. While that is not a negative per se, \"we do believe it presents a higher risk profile, particularly as the company works to transition its reinsurance relationships, significantly lower its net loss ratio, and expand its product offering into more competitive categories, like Homeowners and Pet Insurance,\" said the note. Goldman was the leading underwriter on the Lemonade IPO."}]}
