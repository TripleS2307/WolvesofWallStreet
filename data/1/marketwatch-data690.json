AFP/Getty Images JP Morgan Chase & Co. entered the green-bond world on Wednesday, offloading the bank\u2019s first set of bonds specifically to fund projects with a sustainability bent. While the banking giant has arranged debt with an environmental or social-good purpose for its clients and other companies, this was JP Morgan\u2019s first $1 billion foray into issuing such bonds on its own behalf. Many investors welcomed the move, not only because of the weight JP Morgan JPM, -0.57% carries in the market as the nation\u2019s biggest U.S. bank by assets, but also because of a growing acceptance within the U.S. that a climate crisis threatens both environmental and financial instability.

But Liberatore also stressed that a key part of tackling the unfolding \u201cclimate disaster\u201d is to mitigate it in an \u201ceconomically beneficial way for the average person.\u201d That can mean achieving a lower cost of capital for renewable energy projects than what\u2019s available for funding fossil fuels. To that end, JP Morgan was able to pull in pricing Wednesday amid high investor demand, clearing the bonds at a spread of 48 basis points over Treasurys BX:TMUBMUSD10Y, after they initially were floated in the range of 65 basis points. A bond spread is the level of compensation investors get paid above a risk-free benchmark to act as a creditor, with lower spreads often indicating high demand or a lower expectation of default. \u201cGenerally, green bonds yield less, meaning the cost of financing is lower,\u201d said Pri de Silva, senior corporate credit analysts at Aware Asset Management, adding that JP Morgan priced similar bonds in May that were trading on Wednesday closer to 58 basis points over Treasurys. \u201cFrom a funding perspective, I\u2019d say there was a 10-basis-point advantage,\u201d de Silva said, even though he noted the \u201csunk costs\u201d involved in setting up the new green issuance platform, including providing the \u201cbelts and suspenders\u201d to ensure there\u2019s a process in place to track that only eligible projects are funded. To that end, JP Morgan said proceeds from the debut green bond would finance a range of projects from green buildings to renewable energy, in a public filing. Notably, the bank also listed areas that will be excluded from the funding from bond proceeds, including coal, oil, gas and nuclear energy projects, as well as activities that involve modern slavery, child labor and human rights exploitation. Amid an overall corporate debt boom, the second quarter also saw a record $99.9 billion of \u201csustainability bonds\u201d issued globally, according to Moody\u2019s Investors Service, a category that encompasses green, social and sustainable bonds. JP Morgan\u2019s debut follows on the heels of Citigroup C, +0.47% and Bank of America BAC, +0.47%, which issued green and social-good bonds earlier this year.
