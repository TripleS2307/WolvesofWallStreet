Getty Images Kraft Heinz Co. was upgraded twice, at CFRA and at Guggenheim, after the food company\u2019s investor day, which laid out a go-forward strategy focused on customer eating habits, partnerships and efficiencies. CFRA raised Kraft Heinz\u2019s rating to buy from hold, and moved its 12-month target to $37 from $35. \u201cWe left the meeting with a clearer picture and more confidence that Kraft Heinz can once again return to sustainable earnings growth,\u201d wrote Arun Sundaram, analyst at CFRA Research. Kraft Heinz KHC, -0.35% said it expects to cut $2 billion in costs over the next five years, which will help generate 4% to 6% adjusted earnings per share growth.

Brands like Kraft Singles, Velveeta, Philadelphia and the company\u2019s iconic macaroni and cheese will remain part of the Kraft Heinz lineup. Guggenheim upgraded Kraft Heinz to neutral from sell and raised its price target to $34 from $30. Analysts say they are optimistic about the future of the company under Chief Executive Miguel Patricio, who took on the role in July 2019. \u201cMoving from a short-term, cost-cutting centric company to a consumer-focused, longer-term growth mandate, it\u2019s clear that much work has been done in the past few months \u2013 all while coping with the increased demands associated with the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d analysts led by Laurent Grandet wrote. Guggenheim said it couldn\u2019t be \u201cmore constructive\u201d because of the risks of executing a new plan and the need to off-load additional businesses that are underperforming, like coffee in the U.S. and baby formula in Europe. Kraft Heinz\u2019s coffee brands in the U.S. include Gevalia and Maxwell House.

The company is also taking a close look at its supply chain, reducing SKUs (stock-keeping units) to streamline the business, and creating more partnerships while moving away from \u201ctransactional relationships,\u201d according to Carlos Abrams-Rivera, U.S. zone president at Kraft Heinz, who spoke with MarketWatch on Wednesday. \u201cFor each generation, what are the new needs?\u201d Abrams-Rivera asked. This question was at the heart of the company\u2019s platform transformation. \u201cFamilies are adopting food behaviors based on food moments in their lives. A whole generation is defined by the experience during the pandemic.\u201d Abrams-Rivera said having kids at home during COVID-19 had a tremendous impact on a lot of customers. The company is also taking the shift to e-commerce into account as many shoppers turn to online grocery during the pandemic. Don\u2019t miss: Kroger downgraded at Bank of America as competition with Walmart and Target heats up \u201cOur share, as strong as it is in bricks-and-mortar, is higher in e-commerce,\u201d he said. During the investor conference, CEO Patricio said e-commerce is a $1 billion-plus business for Kraft Heinz and is growing by more than 100%. \u201cWe have 97% penetration,\u201d said CEO Patricio during the investor conference, according to FactSet. \u201cThat means that 97% of the households in America have Kraft Heinz products in them.\u201d Engaging with customers is part of the company\u2019s strategy, Abrams-Rivera told MarketWatch. \u201cCompanies that do well will have an understanding and foresight about how consumers are going to evolve,\u201d he said. Kraft Heinz reported second-quarter adjusted profit and revenue that beat expectations in July. However, it recorded $2.9 billion in goodwill impairment charges and asset impairment charges. \u201cWe find a company with a new strategy for its business that is already in motion, roughly nine months, and therefore perhaps further along and more developed than investors might realize,\u201d wrote Stifel analysts. The pandemic has accelerated the company\u2019s transformation, Stifel said. \u201cIn addition, with such strong cash flow, we are seeing a faster reduction in its debt load, while preserving its dividend, which could reduce its risk profile,\u201d the note reads.

JPMorgan rates Kraft Heinz shares overweight with a $39 price target. Among the reasons for the stock rating are the focus on international growth and the potential for stock buybacks in 2021, which should be bolstered by the Lactalis deal. Kraft Heinz stock has fallen 5% for the year to date while the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% has gained 3.5% for the period."}]}
