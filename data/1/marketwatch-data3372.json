The 10-year note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.777% edged 0.4 basis point higher to 0.652%, while the 2-year note rate TMUBMUSD02Y, 0.156% fell 0.8 basis point to 0.155%. The 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, 1.576% was virtually unchanged at 1.391%.What\u2019s driving Treasurys? The U.S. Treasury Department auction drew healthy appetite among investors for a record-large sale of $29 billion of 10-year notes, fetching its lowest yield in the auction\u2019s history, but the sale did not spur additional trading in a quiet session.

As for the Fed, Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said on Tuesday there was no limit to the amount of Treasurys the central bank could buy. And Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said a full recovery was still a long way away. Daleep Singh, head of the New York Fed\u2019s markets group, noted the functioning of corporate credit markets had strengthened since the Fed unrolled its emergency lending backstops. He said the U.S. central bank could slow its pace of corporate debt purchases if financial markets continued to improve.

A quiet economic calendar left 10-year supply as the major risk event for the day, although the key takeaways were known well before the official auction close. In short, supply is not a primary driver of Treasury yields,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, in a Wednesday note."}]}
