And among investors age 65 and older, nearly a third sold all their stock market investments. It was a discouraging figure, meaning that large numbers of people had picked exactly the wrong time to abandon their investments. Fortunately, the figures were corrected a few days later. The actual numbers turned out to be far smaller. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good news since the stock market recovery, like the downturn itself, was the fastest on record. Still, some people did give up on the market while it was down. On\u00c2 The\u00c2 Wall Street Journal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2 website, where these figures were\u00c2 reported, the article sparked a furious debate, with some readers still vehement that selling stocks was the right thing to do. One wrote that, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI simply don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand the logic why almost all financial advisors say to ride this out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Another put it in more colorful terms: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe marketeers say to stay the course. Do not ask a butcher about the merits of a vegetarian diet\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Many took the opposite view, arguing that it would be a mistake to sell out of stocks. One reader wrote, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHave fun in 20 years when inflation has destroyed the purchasing power of your \u00e2\u0080\u0098safe\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cash and CDs. I believe in the U.S. and in the miracle of our economy\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m all stocks and always will be!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Others didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily weigh in on either side. Instead, they just offered their own personal prescriptions: \u00e2\u0080\u009c10% cash, 45% six year or less duration bond fund and 45% in an SPX, +0.87% fund is all you need.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In all, there were more than 300 reader comments on the article. What struck me, though, is that people were largely talking past each other. It sounded more like a political debate than a financial one. But unlike a political debate, there is a right answer to this question. The numbers, as you might guess, tell us the best strategy is to stay the course. According to a\u00c2 review\u00c2 by Vanguard Group, no fewer than nine different studies going back to the 1960s have confirmed this. But I can understand why some people still sell during market downturns. Every market downturn is different and scary in its own way\u00e2\u0080\u0094and this one was no exception. Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2 Financial Post\u00c2 captured it well. In a mid-March article titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis Time Is Different,\u00e2\u0080\u009d one economist\u00c2 explained\u00c2 why he saw this crisis as even worse than 2008, which was itself terrible: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the [2008] financial crisis, air travel didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come to a halt, borders weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t being closed, we weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talking about quarantines and self-isolation\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. [P]eople weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t scared to leave their homes\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. The reality is the [2008] financial crisis did not come with a mortality rate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In my conversations with investors over the past few months, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard these same sentiments. This pandemic\u00c2 is\u00c2 scary and there is no real parallel or precedent. Yes, there was the 1918 flu. But the economy and our health care system were so different then that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to compare. In fact, according to a Federal Reserve\u00c2 paper, economic data from that era are so limited that it may be impossible to make comparisons. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an investor to do? Sure, the data might say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a mistake to sell, but historical data points are, by definition, backward-looking. If the current crisis, or one in the future, looks different enough and scary enough, what use is the data? Why\u00c2 shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\u00c2 people sell out when a crisis hits? I understand this conundrum and offer two possible answers. My first answer will sound like circular reasoning, but stick with me. The reason you shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry when the next crisis looks different and unprecedented is because all crises are different and unprecedented. If you think about it, our country has been through numerous traumas before\u00e2\u0080\u0094some much worse\u00e2\u0080\u0094and has always survived and gone on to prosper. Amid 2008\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial panic, Berkshire Hathaway Chairman\u00c2 Warren Buffett\u00c2 articulated\u00c2 this point, as I mentioned\u00c2 last week:\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe American miracle, the American magic has always prevailed, and it will do so again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a little superstitious, so I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t list the various types of crises that might occur down the road. But the fact is, some number of bad things will inevitably happen. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the unfortunate reality. As an investor, if you can accept that, I think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have the right mindset to ride out those crises with greater\u00c2 equanimity. That brings me to my second answer. Try to gain a deeper understanding of what\u00c2 drives\u00c2 stock prices. Should you simply take it on faith that the market will go up in the future just because it always has in the past? Definitely not. Instead, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll again defer to Buffett, who has done a good job\u00c2 articulating\u00c2 exactly why you should believe that the market will go up over time. In short, economic growth is a\u00c2 function\u00c2 of birth rates, immigration and gains in productivity, including new inventions. As long as the U.S. is an attractive place to live, and we gain our fair share of smart and driven new citizens, and as a whole we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re industrious and productive, that gives me confidence that our economy\u00e2\u0080\u0094and thus our stock market\u00e2\u0080\u0094will continue to grow. If you were unnerved by this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s market downturn, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t blame you. I would be kidding you if I said I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t also unnerved. And I know there are those who believe we could see another decline. That might well be the case\u00e2\u0080\u0094but if you can keep in mind these two ideas, I think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be able to ride things out with greater peace of mind.
