The latest restrictions were ordered in Newcastle and other English northeast cities on Thursday. But the government had until now pledged to do everything possible to avoid such measures on a national scale. - According to the Financial Times, the government\u2019s scientific advisers have suggested a two-week lockdown that would coincide with the October school holiday, to avoid the punitive economic price inflicted on the country by the first lockdown, which lasted from March to May. - The government\u2019s hope is that the new restrictions, which will involve the renewed closure of restaurants and other hospitality businesses, might act as a \u2018circuit break\u2019 while schools and workplaces would remain open. There is already a ban on social gatherings of more than six people, with limited exceptions. - The U.K. is also trying to cope with insufficient testing capacity amid a surge in demand for tests. Officials said the situation may last until the end of October, which will make it difficult in the next few weeks to assess the actual impact of the pandemic.
