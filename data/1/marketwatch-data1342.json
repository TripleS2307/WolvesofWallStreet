Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share came to $2.92, beating the FactSet consensus of $1.98. Sales grew 7.3% to $2.50 billion, above the FactSet consensus of $2.38 billion, as same-store sales growth of 7.5% beat expectations of a 2.7% rise. So far in the third quarter, the company said it continues to see \"strong growth\" in do-it-yourself channels and positive same-store sales in the professional channel. \"Without question, we benefited from a surge in industry demand in the quarter fueled by the government stimulus, unemployment benefits and the impact COVID-19 had on consumer behavior in terms of how they repaired and maintained their vehicles,\" said Chief Executive Tom Greco. The stock has edged up 0.5% year to date through Monday, the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% has gained 4.7%."}]}
