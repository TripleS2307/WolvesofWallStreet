At the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee meeting Wednesday, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allied producers, collectively known as OPEC+, said they will ease record production cuts of 9.7 million barrels per day to 7.7 million barrels per day starting in August through the end of the year amid signs of improvement in the oil market. Participants in the deal who were unable to fully comply with the reductions in May and June, which include Iraq, will compensate for the added output. Including that compensation, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said actual cuts will be at roughly 8.1 million to as much as 8.34 million barrels per day. An OPEC+ document seen by S&P Global Platts, however, showed that 13 countries pumped above their quotas in the first two months of the deal by a combined 840,000 barrels per day.

September Brent crude BRN.1, -0.07%, the global benchmark, ended 89 cents, or 2.2%, higher at $43.79 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe. Both WTI and Brent crude marked the highest front-month contract settlements since March 6, according to Dow Jones Market Data. In the U.S. Wednesday, the Energy Information Administration reported that domestic crude inventories fell by 7.5 million barrels for the week ended July 10. That compared with a forecast by analysts polled by S&P Global Platts for an average decline of 2.1 million barrels. The American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday reported a drop of 8.3 million barrels. \u201cA huge drop in imports has yielded the biggest draw to oil inventories since the last week of last year,\u201d said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData. \u201cImports into the U.S. Gulf dropped by more than half versus the week prior, as the flotilla of Saudi crude has finally been discharged,\u201d he told MarketWatch. \u201cAccording to our records, Saudi crude imports into the U.S. Gulf dropped to a 9-week low last week, a near 80% drop on the week prior. Accordingly, US Gulf Coast crude stocks drew by 7.9 million barrels.\u201d Although the decline in crude inventories implies a rise in consumption, Lukman Otunugua, senior research analyst at FXTM, warned \u201crising coronavirus cases in the United States, along with some cities in major economies reimposing shutdowns, may hit demand.\u201d The EIA data also showed crude stocks at the Cushing, Okla., storage hub edged up by about 900,000 barrels for the week. Gasoline supply declined by 3.1 million barrels, while distillate stockpiles fell by 453,000 barrels. The S&P Global Platts survey had shown expectations for a supply decline of 2 million barrels for gasoline and an inventory climb of 1.1 million barrels for distillates. On Nymex Wednesday, August gasoline US:RBQ20 tacked on 1.4% to $1.2645 a gallon, while August heating oil US:HOQ20 added 2% to $1.2448 a gallon. August natural gas US:NGQ20 settled at $1.778 per million British thermal units, up 1.8%, ahead of the EIA\u2019s weekly update on supplies of the fuel, due out Thursday."}]}
