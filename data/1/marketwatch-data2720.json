Think again. As people get used to living with coronavirus, social distancing and mask protocols are also easing. As of Monday evening, COVID-19 infections are closing in on 20 million people globally, according to Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Center for Systems Science and Engineering. It has now infected 5,075,678 people in the U.S., killed 163,282 in the U.S., and led to 732,889 deaths worldwide. The number of coronavirus cases is still rising in every region of the country. With 10,382 deaths, California is now the third U.S. state to register over 10,000 deaths after New York (32,781 deaths) and New Jersey (15,878 deaths). Texas has the fourth highest number of fatalities (9,177). America\u2019s COVID-19 death toll in the U.S. could reach nearly 300,000 by Dec. 1, but consistent mask-wearing beginning today could save approximately 70,000 lives, according to new projections based on current fatality and infection rates from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (HME) at the University of Washington\u2019s School of Medicine. \u201cIt appears that people are wearing masks and socially distancing more frequently as infections increase, then after a while as infections drop, people let their guard down and stop taking these measures to protect themselves and others which, of course, leads to more infections,\u201d HME director Christopher Murray said, \u201cand the potentially deadly cycle starts over again.\u201d He said that there appear to be fewer transmissions of the virus in some southern and western states after recent surges, but deaths in California and Florida are still rising and will likely continue to increase for the next couple of weeks. The drop in infections appears to be related to a combination of local mandates for mask wearing in public spaces, and the closure of bars and restaurants.

On April 3, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended the use of cloth masks, saying they were useful for preventing the wearer from passing on the virus if he/she was asymptomatic. It reversed that stance, citing \u201cnew evidence.\u201d Some previous studies have concluded that face masks have helped reduce contagion by reducing droplets being sprayed into the air during flu season; another Japanese-based study says this works when paired with vaccination, which is not an option in this case. It may be that they work in a small amount of cases and/or just wearing them helps to promote healthy behaviors.

The coronavirus is 0.125 um. \u201cThese products can help block large droplets expelled by the wearer, but also have been shown to have efficacy at filtering smaller particles and are designed to fit tightly to the face,\u201d it said. Face masks are needed for health-care professionals. N95 masks are tighter-fitting than surgical masks and protect against small particles and large droplets, according to the CDC. In April, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered all New Yorkers to cover their faces in public when they can\u2019t maintain a proper social distance, but not all states have followed suit. That same month, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio called for all grocery stores in New York, then the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S., to insist that customers wear masks while shopping. \u201cI\u2019m asking every store to put up a sign that you\u2019re required to wear a face covering. This is another one of the things we have to do to protect each other,\u201d he said at the time. Want to make your own mask? Here\u2019s a simple DIY approach. Source: Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington\u2019s School of Medicine \u201cEverybody\u2019s learning,\u201d said Gregory Poland, who studies the immunogenetics of vaccine response in adults and children at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. \u201cWe have just a few months experience with this virus. Face masks should be preserved for health-care workers who are at known obvious high risk.\u201d And the DIY masks for everyone else? \u201cThey help as a memory aid not to touch your face.\u201d Others are even more skeptical than that. Paul Glasziou, a professor of medicine at Bond University in Australia, and Chris Del Mar, a professor of public health at Bond, analyzed a dozen studies on face masks. They concluded: \u201cFace masks may not do much without eye protection.\u201d Experts say masks may also remind people of the seriousness of this public-health emergency. They say it\u2019s best to avoid public settings. \u201cPeople may also wear masks inappropriately, or touch a contaminated part of the mask when removing it and transfer the virus to their hand, then their eyes and thus to the nose,\u201d they wrote in The Conversation. \u201cMasks may also provide a false sense of security, meaning wearers might do riskier things such as going into crowded spaces and places.\u201d President Donald Trump signed four executive orders on Saturday that include extending unemployment benefits after Congress failed to reach a deal on a stimulus package. The Dow Jones Industrial Index DJIA, +0.56% and S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% ended slightly up Monday as investors awaited round two of a fiscal stimulus; the Nasdaq Composite\u2019s COMP, +1.39% ended down."}]}
