AFP via Getty Images President Donald Trump on Wednesday made another visit to North Carolina, as the latest polling in that swing state shows him regaining a slight edge over Democratic challenger Joe Biden in the wake of last month\u2019s party conventions. Trump delivered a speech in Wilmington, N.C., about its designation as the first American World War II Heritage City. The port city is known in part for being home to a major shipyard during World War II, as well as for currently being home to the Battleship North Carolina, which served as a backdrop during the president\u2019s remarks. \u201cWith this designation, we proudly declare that in America, we don\u2019t tear down the past. We celebrate our heroes. We cherish our heritage,\u201d Trump said, in a reference to how statues around the world are being removed amid a re-examination of racial injustices. The president praised World War II veterans who attended his speech, such as 97-year-old Medal of Honor recipient Hershel \u201cWoody\u201d Williams. \u201cHe\u2019s 100% sharp. I know a 78-year-old that\u2019s not so sharp, but he\u2019s 97 and he\u2019s 100%,\u201d Trump said, in a reference to Biden, who is 77 and will turn 78 in November. Both Trump, who is 74, and Biden have been criticized as being too old to serve as president. Opinion: As Trump and Biden trade age insults, older workers suffer Ahead of Trump\u2019s trip on Wednesday, the Biden campaign issued a statement from the former vice president criticizing the Republican incumbent. \u201cPresident Trump likes to call himself a wartime president, but the reality is that North Carolinians are still suffering because he surrendered to COVID-19 long ago,\u201d Biden said in the statement. \u201cInstead of providing North Carolina the roadmap and resources needed to protect small businesses, schools, and families, he has criticized local leaders and threatened educators for listening to public health experts.\u201d Biden also gave a speech Wednesday in which he attacked Trump\u2019s push for schools to reopen quickly amid the coronavirus pandemic. Trump\u2019s Wednesday trip follows his in-person appearance at a Republican National Convention event in Charlotte last week, when he said he \u201cfelt an obligation\u201d to be in North Carolina, a state \u201cthat\u2019s been very good to me.\u201d He also criticized Biden for not going in person to his convention in Wisconsin, another battleground state. Trump is slated to campaign on Thursday in Pennsylvania, a swing state that Biden visited on Monday. Related: Trump lays blames with Democrats as he surveys \u2018destruction\u2019 in Kenosha, Wis.
