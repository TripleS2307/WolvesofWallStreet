Since then, as outbreaks intensified and the virus spread to Europe, and then the Americas, Osterholm, a flu expert with experience working in the CDC who heads up the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, has become one of the nation\u2019s leading voices on the pandemic, weighing in on everything from masks to contact tracing. Osterholm\u2019s viewpoint is sobering. The 67-year-old expects the novel coronavirus to be present for the rest of his life. He doesn\u2019t believe the wave theory (a first wave, a lull, followed by other waves) will apply to this pandemic. \u201cThat\u2019s not what\u2019s happening here,\u201d he told MarketWatch in an interview. MarketWatch: One of the things I\u2019m pretty interested in is the talk and the hope around a vaccine. Do you think we have misconceptions about what it means when we have a vaccine? Michael Osterholm: Everyone is looking at the vaccine as being a light switch: on or off. And I look at it as a rheostat, that\u2019s going to take a long time, from turning it on from its darkest position to a lightest position. If you\u2019re anticipating a light switch, you\u2019re going to be concerned, confused, and in some cases very disappointed in what it might look like in those first days to months with a vaccine. MarketWatch: I saw a piece in The Atlantic this week and I thought they positioned it well. They described it as the beginning of the end. Osterholm: It won\u2019t be. We will be dealing with this virus forever. Effective and safe vaccines and hopefully ones with some durability will be very important, even critical tools, in fighting it. But the whole world is going to be experiencing COVID-19 \u2018til the end of time. We\u2019re not going to be vaccinating our way out of this to eight-plus billion people in the world right now. And if we don\u2019t get durable immunity, we\u2019re potentially looking at revaccination on a routine basis, if we can do that. We\u2019ve really got to come to grips with actually living with this virus, for at least my lifetime, and at the same time, it doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t do a lot about it. MarketWatch: Do you think we\u2019re going to see some of these vaccines fail in clinical studies? Osterholm: One of the challenges we have is: what do we mean by fail? What\u2019s the definition? Some people right now have a view that any vaccine that isn\u2019t like the measles vaccine is going to be a challenge, meaning they\u2019ve got to work 93% to 98% of the time. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any sense that that\u2019s going to happen with this vaccine. That doesn\u2019t mean that there isn\u2019t going to be an effective vaccine at 50%, 60% or 70%. We have to keep watching for safety signals. We have to make sure that over time we can assure the public with open and transparent data that: This is what you can expect in terms of reactions, this is what might have any long-term complications. MarketWatch: When it comes to how medical information is being disseminated, there have been a lot of changes. You\u2019ve done some peer review and work with journals. Do you think some of these preliminary scientific writings are being shared with the public too soon? Osterholm: Oh, absolutely. We\u2019re drinking from a fire hose right now in terms of new information. You can make the case that\u2019s important because we\u2019re in a position to learn things that could have a very real impact on patient outcome and therefore getting the data out are critical. But then there\u2019s a downside to that, too, because with that comes an increasing amount of marginal if not potentially erroneous information. MarketWatch: Do you think we\u2019re going to see distinct waves of outbreaks in the U.S.? Osterholm: No, no. They\u2019re not waves. We\u2019ve never had a pandemic due to coronavirus before. We\u2019ve had influenza pandemics. With an influenza pandemic, you do get true waves, meaning you get a first big peak of cases, then the numbers come down substantially without any human intervention. It\u2019s nothing we do. We\u2019ve never understood why that happens, and then a few months later you get a second wave. At this point, that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening here. This is like a forest fire, full steam ahead. And wherever there\u2019s human wood to burn, it\u2019ll do it. What we see, though, are these spikes in cases where human mitigation strategies ended, or they\u2019re not adhering to them ... This is just one constant pressure that\u2019s occurring. MarketWatch: And human mitigation [like mask wearing or social distancing] declines? Osterholm: Right. And everyone\u2019s expecting it. Look at Hong Kong, which is doing an outstanding public health follow up, and yet they are still having a problem. Think of this like a big forest fire. If you\u2019re in the way of it, you\u2019re going to get burned. The best we can do is try to put out as much as we can. But even knowing that, if you just suppress it, it\u2019s going to come back. The embers are still there because we never really put it out. MarketWatch: What do you think the biggest failure in the U.S. response has been? Osterholm: We\u2019ve failed because we declared victory over the virus when we had no business doing so. This virus has been poised to be transmitted in our communities, and we thought we had done enough to get it down. It\u2019s like a fire crew. \u201cI only put out half the forest fire but you know, I put out half so we\u2019re done.\u201d And then look what happened. It\u2019s burned more acres since we gave up than it did before we gave up. MarketWatch: What was that moment when you realize the seriousness of this virus? Osterholm: I just could tell based on all the data we had, and it was one of those \u201coh my God\u201d moments. No one knew for certain how a coronavirus is going to act, and, unfortunately, it\u2019s fulfilling all my worst nightmares. One challenge that is yet to really be understood is just what kind of durable immunity we get from infection and vaccine. We\u2019re making assumptions right now that\u2019s going to last. If it doesn\u2019t, that really complicates things. If you have double, triple, and quadruple jeopardy with this virus, that\u2019s not a pretty picture. MarketWatch: Are we getting going to get close to [herd immunity] by a vaccine? Or is the goal to keep as many people safe as possible? Osterholm: Again, it goes back to the question we just discussed: is there durable immunity? Because herd immunity is based on the concept that once you have immunity, it stays. One of our goals has been to postpone as many cases we can until the vaccine is available and use that as your means for getting 50% to 70% of the population protected. But we don\u2019t know what immunity means for either natural disease or vaccine. Herd immunity is still, in some ways, that theoretical state to get to but we\u2019re not sure we ever will. This Q&A has been edited for clarity and length."}]}
