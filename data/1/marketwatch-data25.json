This man is spending it, and it feels great", "body": "Getty Images/iStockphoto I woke up one morning, looked in the mirror and didn\u2019t recognize the person looking back at me. Who is this person? It can\u2019t be me. I\u2019m not the same person I was five or six months ago. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the pandemic that caused me to behave differently or if I\u2019m going through some kind of midlife crisis. No, it can\u2019t be a midlife crisis. I\u2019m almost 70 years old, plus I don\u2019t feel my life is boring, empty or meaningless. In fact, I actually feel good about myself and my life. Read: The problem with aging in place Instead, what I don\u2019t understand is why I have a different attitude toward money. All my life, I\u2019ve been a supersaver. It was the main reason I was able to retire early. It sure wasn\u2019t because of my investing skills. I was, at best, just an average investor. But recently, I\u2019ve been spending gobs of money in ways I never would have in the past. I\u2019m doing a complete remodel of my house. Of course, some of the work needed to be done, but not everything. If it didn\u2019t involve a mountain of building permits and other paperwork, I\u2019d probably have added on to the house, too. Oh, did I tell you I bought all new appliances and furniture for the house? If I were my younger self, I would say it was wasteful spending. But I\u2019m not my younger self anymore. I\u2019m someone else. I\u2019m not just spending money on the house. I bought a car and I\u2019m planning to buy another vehicle later this year. If it weren\u2019t for COVID-19, I would be on my way to Europe for a month or two. In fact, I charged so much on my credit cards that I received a notice my credit score has dropped. I don\u2019t care. That won\u2019t stop me from spending. Read: Half of Americans over 55 may retire poor I\u2019ve got a list of things I want to see and do when this pandemic is over. It\u2019s going to take more money, but I\u2019m not stressed about it. I\u2019ve got all these retirement accounts to finance my new spending habit: a traditional IRA, rollover IRA, Roth IRA and an old 401(k). And don\u2019t forget Social Security, which will kick in next year at age 70. It\u2019s baffling. I don\u2019t know what suddenly brought on this impulse to spend without hesitation, but I have no regrets about it. My wife is right there with me, spending left and right, so it can\u2019t be just me going through some sort of crisis. She, like me, was always a cautious spender. In fact, that\u2019s one of many reasons we get along so well. I have a theory about why I\u2019m behaving the way I am. When you\u2019re young, you play the long game. You save and invest for your future, knowing you may live another 40 or 60 years. But when you\u2019re older, you play the short game. Your timeline is condensed and you\u2019re more willing to spend down your savings to live an enjoyable and comfortable retirement. I\u2019m playing the short game. I\u2019m in spending mode. There\u2019s no reason my wife and I should adhere to our past behavior of saving and pinching pennies for the future. The future is now. Why not spend in a way that\u2019ll allow us to enjoy life to the fullest? We have no family obligations, except for a son who doesn\u2019t need our financial help. Still, we\u2019re planning to leave him some money. We saved our whole life to get where we are. We aren\u2019t irresponsible spenders aiming to die penniless, but we\u2019re going to make sure we enjoy the rest of our life as best we can. If that means spending down our retirement savings, so be it. This column originally appeared on Humble Dollar. It was republished with permission.
