There were 338,779 new cases and 5,514 fatalities in the 24-hour period, the agency said. India counted 78,524 new infections, followed by Brazil with 41,906. The previous record was 330,340, set on Oct. 2. The WHO reported a one-day record number of deaths on April 17 at 12,393. The U.S. continues to lead the world by case tally and death count and added 56,045 new cases on Thursday, according to a New York Times tracker. There were at least 928 deaths, the tracker shows. The U.S. has averaged 47,036 cases a day in the past week, up 12% from the average two weeks earlier. The U.S. has 7.6 million cases, and 212,789 Americans have died, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. The virus is surging in the Northeast, after it was successfully tamped down there earlier in the year, when New York was the epicenter. Now, new cases are on the rise, and hospitalizations are increasing, leading governors to reimpose restrictions. \u201c \u2018The U.S. COVID outbreak appears to be on a knife-edge.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Ian Shepherdson, Pantheon Macroeconomics Clusters have emerged in Connecticut, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, according to the New York Times. In New York City, the number of new cases is averaging more than 500 for the first time since June, and the city is closing nonessential businesses and houses of worship in areas of Queens and Brooklyn. The continued increase in test numbers, averaging 878,000 over the past week, compared with a low of 624,000 in mid-September, is contributing to the increase in confirmed cases, said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cBut the national average test-positivity rate has risen to near the top of its [4.5% to 6.5%] range, and the median state positivity rate over the past week is 6.7%, the highest since early September,\u201d Shepherdson wrote in a note to clients. \u201cSuch high positivity rates imply an increased risk of undetected clusters, which can then spread rapidly. \u201cThe U.S. COVID outbreak appears to be on a knife-edge, with a real risk of much more rapid increases in cases over the next few weeks, following the pattern seen in Europe,\u201d Shepherdson wrote. The upper Midwest and the Plains are becoming a hot spot that is pressuring hospital capacity, according to the Associated Press. Wisconsin, North Dakota and South Dakota are leading the U.S. in new cases per capita, following months in which their citizens and in some cases state governments rejected face-mask requirements and downplayed the risk of the disease. North Dakota has no face-mask mandate and is seeing 770 new cases per 100,000 residents, the highest in the country. From the archives (July 3):Masks optional, no social distancing on agenda for Trump fireworks event at Mount Rushmore Wisconsin health officials are planning to open a field hospital next week to combat a shortage of beds that threatens to overwhelm hospitals and health centers. \u201cWe hoped this day wouldn\u2019t come, but unfortunately, Wisconsin is in a much different, more dire place today and our healthcare systems are beginning to become overwhelmed by the surge of COVID-19 cases,\u201d Democratic Gov. Tony Evers said in a statement. \u201cThis alternative care facility will take some of the pressure off our healthcare facilities while expanding the continuum of care for folks who have COVID-19.\u201d Evers is currently facing a court challenge from state Republicans over Wisconsin\u2019s face-mask mandate.

And then you\u2019re immune, you know?\u201d Trump also said he believed he could have recovered without the multiple treatments he was given. Michael Dowling, chief executive of Northwell Health, a nonprofit health-care network serving New York state, lamented the lack of leadership that has put the U.S. in the dire position of most cases and deaths in the world. \u201cIf you get COVID in a serious way, it does dominate you,\u201d Dowling said in an interview on MSNBC, addressing language used by Trump, who told Americans not to be afraid or let the virus dominate them earlier this week \u201cIt would be interesting if way back a number of months ago, we had national leadership who said, \u2018You know, we\u2019re at war against a major virus, and I am going to show you through my example and educate you that all of us in a unified way across the whole U.S. should be taking every safety measure that we possibly can,\u2019 so you have a unity of purpose, a unity of mission. If we had done that nationally five or six months ago, we would be in a much better position today.\u201d Dowling also criticized Trump over mixed messaging on face masks, which has led many of his supporters to reject wearing them. \u201cLeadership is about telling the truth and dealing with reality,\u201d he said.

The move is a boost for the program, which was rejected by Trump. The COVAX program aims to deliver 2 billion doses of vaccine by end-2021. \u2022 More French cities are joining Paris in closing bars and caf\u00e9s for at least two weeks, Euronews reported.

GILD, +0.82% said that a late-stage study of its experimental COVID-19 treatment showed it shortened time to recovery. The company said a study of remdesivir plus standard of care shortened the time of recovery by an average of four days, compared with a placebo and standard of care. Patients were also 50% more likely to have recovered 15 days after treatment compared with those given a placebo, the company said.

HCA, +1.61% offered an upbeat outlook for third-quarter revenue, guiding for $13.3 billion, up 4.8% from a year ago and ahead of the FactSet consensus of $12.69 billion.

A \u201crecovery in air traffic will be slower than previously anticipated,\u201d hampering JetBlue and other airlines\u2019 efforts to drum up business until COVID-19 cases decrease or until treatment or a vaccine against the virus become available. JetBlue\u2019s cash burn is likely to \u201cremain material well into 2021,\u201d Fitch said. The ratings agency also worried about the airline\u2019s going deeper into debt, which helped it with liquidity but puts pressure on debt metrics in the longer term, it said. Airlines have been \u201cproactive\u201d in cutting capacity as demand has lagged, Fitch said. As capacity increases, so will costs, \u201cand JetBlue will not see the same types of cost savings that some larger carriers will see from things like fleet retirements and management head count reduction,\u201d the ratings agency said. \u201cHowever, JetBlue is starting from a lower cost base, which Fitch believes puts the company in a better position to recover from the downturn.\u201d Air-travel demand recovered some from April\u2019s trough, but the pace of recovery slowed as reported cases began to rise again in June. \u201cFitch expects traffic levels to remain anemic until case levels improve substantially or until more effective treatments or a vaccine become widely available,\u201d it said. \u2022 Walt Disney Co.
