That is the conclusion of a new study from consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal (A&M), which looked at the share performance of 245 corporates after they were targeted by activists during the six months to the end of August. It found that U.K. companies targeted by activist investors during the period outperformed the Stoxx Europe 600 equity benchmark by 1.5%. European companies targeted by activists did less well, outperforming the same index by just 0.1%, while U.S. targets underperformed the S&P 500 index by 5.8% over the same time frame. \u201cThe diverging performance of activist targets across the regions underlines that activists are playing by different national rules. The more collaborative approach U.K.-focused activists typically take with boards can leave corporates better equipped to react quickly to external shocks, such as COVID,\u201d said Malcolm McKenzie, managing director at A&M. \u201cIn contrast, the generally more hostile nature of U.S. campaigns has taken its toll on share performance amid COVID, distracting management desperately trying to navigate the COVID disruptions,\u201d he added.

Meanwhile, Nelson Peltz\u2019s Trian Fund Management has built up stakes in Invesco IVZ, +1.23% and Janus Henderson JHG, +2.37%, and plans to push for consolidation to create a rival to the biggest asset managers in the world. U.K. targets also outperformed their European and U.S. rivals over a longer time period. Activist campaigns including a mergers and acquisitions component also had a positive impact on the share price of their targets, outperforming the market by 2.8% over the two-year period. However, this slumped significantly to -2.9% in the six months during the COVID-19 pandemic. A&M attributed this, in part, to the slowdown in merger activity during the pandemic, and the subsequent failure to deliver the share price increases that had been assumed by the market.
