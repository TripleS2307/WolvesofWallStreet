Coca-Cola KO, +0.69% calls it an \u201cexperimental drink\u201d that was inspired by the use of Topo Chico by many bartenders. The news comes days after the beverage giant said, during its second-quarter earnings announcement , that it would be shutting down brands and items that don\u2019t have the growth potential of certain smaller brands or its core beverage items. The Odwalla brand of juices was shuttered on July 31. One of the brands that Coca-Cola Chief Executive James Quincey mentioned as having momentum is Topo Chico.

Bank of America analysts called 2019 \u201ca breakthrough year for hard seltzers, as the sub category more than doubled in size.\u201d \u201cConsumer interest in hard seltzer is coming from a combination of health/wellness (low carbohydrate/calories) and mining a seam that exists between consumer demand for wine and spirits versus beer,\u201d analysts wrote in a February note. More recently, both Boston Beer Co. Inc. SAM, -0.19% and Molson Coors Beverage Co. TAP, -1.87% said their respective hard seltzer brands, Truly Spiked & Sparkling and Vizzy Hard Seltzer, are flying off shelves. Boston Beer is the parent of Samuel Adams beer brands. \u201cSince early January, Truly has significantly grown its velocity and has sequentially grown its market share, while many other hard seltzer brands have entered the category,\u201d said David Burwick, chief executive of Boston Beer, during the company\u2019s second quarter earnings call on July 23, according to a FactSet transcript. Truly and another hard seltzer brand, Market Anthony Brands International\u2019s White Claw, had 80% of the hard seltzer market at the end of 2019, according to Bank of America.

STZ, +0.81% . \u201cTruly is the only hard seltzer not introduced this year to grow its share during 2020,\u201d Burwick said. The company plans to continue to invest in the brand as new competitors launch. It is also looking at opportunities to be sold in bars and other venues, or \u201con-premise,\u201d as those opportunities arise. On-premise business has come to a virtual halt due to the coronavirus pandemic. Boston Beer had expected to bring Truly to more bars and restaurants this summer. \u201c[E]ven with the places that have opened their outdoor seating, it\u2019s still distanced and it\u2019s a fraction of what it used to be, and putting your products in is not high on their list,\u201d said C. James Koch, Boston Beer\u2019s founder, on the second-quarter earnings call. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s going to be summer 2021 when we see a big penetration of hard seltzers, and I expect it will get to the point where you walk into a bar or a restaurant and you expect them to have some hard seltzer, probably either Truly or White Claw.\u201d Molson Coors\u2019 hard seltzer Vizzy launched this year. Don\u2019t miss:Domino\u2019s Pizza could snap up market share with \u2018improved\u2019 wings \u201cDespite not launching nationally until April, it is already the number three seltzer in a number of markets, and is beating Bud Light Seltzer in repeat purchase rates,\u201d said Gavin Hattersley, chief executive of Molson Coors, on the second-quarter earnings call last week, according to FactSet. Molson Coors has also acquired Atwater Brewing, a Midwest brewing company that makes craft seltzers. And the company has partnerships overseas to bring hard seltzer to Europe. Coors Seltzer is planned for August. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make sure we\u2019ve got strong pressure behind big trusted brands like Miller Lite and Coors Light,\u201d Hattersley said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to drive trial and awareness behind our new innovations of Vizzy and Coors Seltzer and Blue Moon LightSky.\u201d Blue Moon LightSky is brewed with tangerine peel and has 95 calories. Coca-Cola stock has slumped 15.7% for the year to date, Boston Beer shares have soared 119% and Molson Coors stock is down 31.8% for the period. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% is up 2.3% for 2020 so far."}]}
