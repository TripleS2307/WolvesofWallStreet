In Marseille, the newly-elected mayor indicated the local police wouldn\u2019t slap fines on restaurants that remain open in violation of a recent government decree. Meanwhile, the government is expected to announce the same, most severe level of alert and restrictions for Paris in the coming days. - In London, where police clashed with protesters over the weekend, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson barely avoided a major crisis on Wednesday with the members of Parliament from his own Conservative Party. But he was warned by Speaker of the House of Commons Lindsay Hoyle that he should stop treating the legislative branch \u201cwith contempt,\u201d and start consulting MPs before enacting stringent restrictions. \u201cSome explanations why important measures have come into effect before they can be laid before this House have been unconvincing and show a total disregard for the House,\u201d Hoyle said in statement. - In Spain, the center-left central government and the conservative head of the Madrid region are engaged in a mutual blame game over the measures enacted in the Spanish capital, which the government deems insufficient to curb the rising number of infections.

The coronavirus dilemma \u2014 protect the economy, or protect the population \u2014 is becoming tougher to manage, as the economic recovery threatens to peter out throughout Europe. The protests now don\u2019t only come from fringe far-right movements, as they did earlier this year during the first phase of the virus. But as people seem to gradually lose trust in their governments\u2019 handling of the virus, official decisions, laws and regulations are now systematically contested, whether on health or economic grounds. And the counterfactual \u2014 what would happen to the economy if nothing was done now \u2014 is by definition more difficult to argue.
