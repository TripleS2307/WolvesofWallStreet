The iShares MSCI Eurozone ETF EZU, +0.81% was down 0.7% at midday, while the iShares Core MSCI Europe ETF IEUR, +1.00% and the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF VGK, +0.96% both lost 0.6%. In the U.S., stock indexes were mixed: the broad-market S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% was flat. European stocks haven't enjoyed the same recovery from the market turmoil of the spring that domestic stocks have. The ETFs noted above have lost 10-11% in the year to date. That has prompted some analysts to recommend them as a value strategy, but a resurgence of the coronavirus might scuttle that idea."}]}
