This series examines the financial progress made by women in the U.S. since the Equal Credit Opportunity Act was passed in 1974. In this installment: the 2010s, when the Credit Card Act was amended to allow stay-at-home moms to get their own credit cards and the percentage of female breadwinners hit an all-time high.The Credit Card Act amendment The Credit Card Act of 2009 aimed to increase fairness and transparency to consumers by issuers. Part of the act called for issuers to determine whether cardholders could reasonably pay before extending them a credit card or increasing their credit limit. However, this determination was made by considering the individual applicant\u2019s assets and income, making it hard for stay-at-home parents to get their own cards. But in 2013, an amendment to the act changed the rules to include income and assets the stay-at-home parent has access to. This means that stay-at-home mothers over the age of 21 can use their household assets and income \u2014 as opposed to individual assets and income \u2014 to prove they can pay off their credit cards.

According to a Pew Research analysis of Census Bureau data, 7% of dads stayed at home compared with 27% of moms, as of 2016. Most stay-at-home parents do so in order to care for family members, but regardless of the reason they\u2019re staying home they can use their spouse\u2019s income to apply for credit because of this amendment. Nerd tip: You and your spouse don\u2019t share a credit score, and this amendment doesn\u2019t change that. You still need to have your own sufficient credit to get approved for a credit card. If you don\u2019t have a credit score yet, or your credit is poor, you can ask your spouse to add you as an authorized user on his or her card until you\u2019ve built a good enough score to get your own.Women and finance: Female breadwinners Let\u2019s jump to women who work outside the home: Women are earning more degrees than men and closing the breadwinner gap. In the 2016-2017 school year, women were awarded more than half of degrees at every postsecondary education level \u2013 60.8% of associate degrees, 57.3% of bachelor\u2019s degrees, 59.4% of master\u2019s degrees and 53.3% of doctorates. More than 2 in 5 mothers (41%) are the sole or primary breadwinners for their families, and more than two-thirds of Black mothers (68.3%) are the breadwinners for their families, as of 2017.
