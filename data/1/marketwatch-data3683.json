The company said it had net income of $195 million, or 90 cents a share, in the quarter, up from $329.4 million, or $1.52 a share, in the year-earlier period. Adjusted per-share earnings came to $1.55 a share, well ahead of the 68 cents FactSet consensus. Sales fell 15.1% to $2.503 billion from $2.948 billion, but were also ahead of the $2.449 billion FactSet consensus. \"As expected, we experienced a significant adverse volume impact in the second quarter of 2020 resulting from the closure of the on-premise channel in nearly all of our markets for most of the quarter,\" the company said in a statement. \"Specifically, for the second quarter of 2020, we estimate that nearly all of our consolidated net sales resulted from off-premise consumption.\" The shift to off-premise and certain packaging, strained the company's supply chain and package availability, particularly with aluminum can demand and other packaging materials, said the statement. The company is not offering guidance, given the uncertainty created by the pandemic although it cautioned that it expects operations to continue to be disrupted in the rest of fiscal 2020 and possibly beyond. Shares have fallen 32% in the year to date, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% has gained 0.9%."}]}
