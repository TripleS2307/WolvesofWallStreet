LUV, +1.89% rose 1.5% in premarket trading Thursday, after the air carrier swung to a large loss that was narrower than expected, as the drop in passengers demand wasn't as bad as feared. The company said bookings have slowed during July. The net loss was $915 million, or $1.63 a share, after net income of $741 million, or $1.37 a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding non-recurring items, the adjusted loss per share was $2.67, compared with the FactSet loss consensus of $2.73. Total revenue fell 82.9% to $1.01 billion, but was above the FactSet consensus of $947.9 million, as passenger revenue declined 87.2% to $704 million but beat expectations of $577 million. Load factor fell to 31.4% from 86.4%, but topped expectations of 20.5%. \"Thus far in July 2020, bookings for all months have softened; trip cancellations have increased modestly; and the rate of sequential monthly improvement for July revenue trends has slowed,\" the company said. The stock has tumbled 38.3% year to date through Wednesday, while the U.S. Global Jets ETF JETS, +0.16% has shed 48.6% and the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% has gained 1.4%."}]}
