Then there are days like today, when I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take how stupidly bullish this market can be.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CNBC \u00e2\u0080\u009cMad Money\u00e2\u0080\u009d host Jim Cramer shaking his head at \u00e2\u0080\u0098clueless\u00e2\u0080\u0099 investors who ignored multiple warning signs to buy up stocks during Tuesday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bullish trading action. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNever underestimate the power of enthusiastic buyers who do not know what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said after the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% \u00c2 finished the session with a triple-digit gain. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% \u00c2 and Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39% \u00c2 also ended higher. He specifically pointed to oil giant BP BP, -0.74% \u00c2 and biopharma firm Sorrento SRNE, +0.67% \u00c2 as examples. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cplenty of stupidity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cespecially during earnings season when there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so much news that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to keep track of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d BP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surge, in particular, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sit right with Cramer, who said it might be the \u00e2\u0080\u009cdumbest action\u00e2\u0080\u009d so far this year. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot only are they telling you business is terrible, BP is trying to distance itself from crude while preserving cash, but maybe that dividend hike was a mistake,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. In Sorrento\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case, Cramer pointed out the stock barely rallied last week when the company announced a new saliva-based Covid-19 test that yields results within half an hour. But then on Tuesday, the stock surged for the same reason. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe stock market\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supposed to be efficient,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut somehow it took Wall Street six days to process this news.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Watch this clip: As for Wednesday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s session, more stupidity? The Dow was up more than 300 points, at last check, while both the S&P and Nasdaq were adding to recent gains, as well. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre any of these moves the fault of the Fed?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cramer wrote in a separate take. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, the fault, as Cassius tells us, is not in our stars like Trump or Powell, but in the buyers themselves.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}]}
