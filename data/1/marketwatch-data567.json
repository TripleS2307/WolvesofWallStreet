Starting last Monday, \u00e2\u0080\u009cpersonal care\u00e2\u0080\u009d services, including spas, massage parlors, and the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s estimated 4,000 nail salons, were allowed to reopen in a limited capacity. But the reopenings will hardly mark a return to the typical mani-pedi routine many New Yorkers have come to expect. Phase 3 guidelines mandate that salons operate at no more than 50% capacity, and that social distancing of 6 feet between individuals be enforced wherever possible. Waiting areas are\u00c2 closed, and masks are mandatory. Coronavirus update: Health officials clamor for U.S. states seeing spikes in COVID-19 infections to pause reopening State guidelines also recommend that personal care businesses adopt \u00e2\u0080\u009cappointment-only\u00e2\u0080\u009d policies in order to limit crowding, a move that further limits revenue by cutting off business from drop-in clients, a significant source of income for many salons in highly trafficked areas.\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnyone who relies on people showing up at their door, whether you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re retail, hospitality, or hair or nail salons, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all going to struggle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Steve Sleeper, executive director of the Professional Beauty Association, a national trade organization.\u00c2 Nail technicians and salon employees have raised concerns about whether these safety measures will be properly enforced, however, and whether protective equipment such as gloves and masks will be consistently available.\u00c2 The top concern \u00e2\u0080\u009cwith workers is if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to get proper protective equipment from salon owners to be able to come home safe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Luis Gomez, director of organizing for Workers United a labor union in the U.S. and Canada, which represents the New York Nail Salon Workers Association. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEven pre-Covid, workers were required to have gloves and masks provided by salon owners, but worst case, they weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t being provided at all, or workers were having to pay for it themselves. There were rampant violations.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To make up for limits on customer volume, some salons in parts of New York state that had entered Phase 3 before the city extended the hours and days that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re open.

With longer hours but fewer customers and nail techs allowed at a time, many salon workers may not be earning the equivalent of their pre-pandemic incomes.\u00c2 \u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf a salon is actually compliant, that means they have less people actually in the space at a time, and currently workers are still under the tip system,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gomez said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTip the technician well.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2 Visitors to salons should also be prepared to keep their masks on at all times, get used to technicians working with gloves on, and stay home if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re feeling sick or have otherwise potentially been exposed to the virus. Initially after reopenings in other states nail parlors saw a rush of appointments from regulars who have spent the past several months forgoing their usual beauty treatments, Sleeper said. But with some customers and even some employees uneasy about returning to business as usual, many businesses haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been able to generate their usual levels of income.

And though data on viral spread in salons, which already adhere to rigorous health standards, is encouraging \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a case of a Missouri salon where masks prevented two sick employees from spreading the virus is widely cited as an example \u00e2\u0080\u0094 restrictions that hamper manicurists\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ability to turn a profit are likely to remain in place indefinitely, creating long-term financial strain."}]}
