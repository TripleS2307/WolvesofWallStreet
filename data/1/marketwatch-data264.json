Kamala Harris about the Green New Deal. \u201cVice President Biden said in last week\u2019s debate that he does not support the Green New Deal, but if you look at the Biden-Harris campaign website, it describes the Green New Deal as a crucial framework. What exactly would be the stance of a Biden-Harris administration toward the Green New Deal?\u201d asked the moderator, USA Today\u2019s Susan Page. Harris didn\u2019t answer the question about the legislative framework that aims to address climate change, as the California Democrat instead talked up Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden\u2019s economic plan. From the archives (March 2019):Senate rejects Green New Deal, with most Democrats voting \u2018present\u2019 in protest of McConnell\u2019s calling show vote on the environmental policy framework \u201cFirst of all, I will repeat, and the American people know, that Joe Biden will not ban fracking,\u201d she said. \u201cJoe Biden has been very clear that he thinks about growing jobs, which is why he will not increase taxes for anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year.\u201d The senator also said \u201cMoody\u2019s MCO, +0.88%, which is a reputable Wall Street firm, has said we\u2019ll create 7 million more jobs than Donald Trump\u2019s.\u201d She said some of the jobs will have to do with \u201cclean energy ICLN, +1.56% and renewable energy.\u201d Opinion:Nouriel Roubini says Biden is better for the economy than Trump Harris added that climate change \u201cis an existential threat to us as human beings,\u201d leading Page to ask Vice President Mike Pence if he believed that as well. Trump\u2019s running mate didn\u2019t answer the question.

Here\u2019s why \u201cThe climate is changing. We\u2019ll follow the science. But once again, Sen. Harris is denying the fact that they\u2019re going to raise taxes on every American,\u201d Pence said, adding that could come from Biden\u2019s pledge to repeal Trump\u2019s 2017 tax overhaul. \u201cWe don\u2019t need a massive $2 trillion Green New Deal that would oppose all new mandates on American businesses and American families,\u201d the former Indiana governor said. Pence and Harris also clashed over the Trump administration\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic and other issues, as they faced off in the sole vice-presidential debate of the 2020 campaign.
