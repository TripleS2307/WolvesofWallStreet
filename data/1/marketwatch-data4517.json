In a rare acknowledgment of potential bad news, Trump said the pandemic \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill probably, unfortunately, get worse before it gets better, something I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like saying about things but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the way it is.\u00e2\u0080\u009d After weeks of focusing on issues unrelated to the pandemic and not wearing a mask himself, the president also urged Americans to wear face coverings and practice social distancing to slow the spread of the virus. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re asking everybody that when are you are not able to socially distance, wear a mask,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said, a day after tweeting a picture of himself wearing one. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhether you like the mask or not, they have an impact,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.

Trump lags presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden in polls before the November election and more Americans disapprove of his handling of the pandemic than approve. A recent Washington Post-ABC News poll found that Americans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 views of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s handling of the outbreak have deteriorated. The survey showed 38% approved of his handling of the pandemic, down from 46% in May. Sixty percent disapprove, up from 53% in May. In a Quinnipiac University poll released July 15, two-thirds of respondents said they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t trust information Trump was giving about the coronavirus. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top infectious disease expert was notably absent from the briefings unlike press conferences Trump held earlier this year. He told CNN he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t invited. Trump said Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coronavirus response coordinator, was \u00e2\u0080\u009cright outside\u00e2\u0080\u009d the room. In recent days, Trump has called Fauci \u00e2\u0080\u009ca little bit of an alarmist,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as Fauci has defended his own response to the outbreak.

The president called the outbreak the \u00e2\u0080\u009cChina virus\u00e2\u0080\u009d during the briefing, reprising a slap at Beijing, and said the country \u00e2\u0080\u009cshould have stopped it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The initial cases of the virus occurred in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. In recent speeches, Biden has criticized Trump for what he says is his failure to address the COVID-19 pandemic. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quit on you. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quit on this country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Biden said of the president in a speech on Tuesday.
