GE, +2.85% took a dive in afternoon trading Tuesday, after the industrial conglomerate disclosed that it received a \"Wells notice\" from the Securities and Exchange Commission related to an investigation into revenue recognition practices. The notice advises GE that the SEC staff is considering recommending a civil injunctive action against the company for possible violations of securities laws. The stock sank 3.2%, after being up about 1.6% just before the disclosure. The SEC's investigation comes after GE shocked investors in January 2018 by saying it was taking a multibillion charge following a review of GE Capital's insurance portfolio. The scope of the investigation was expanded after GE's announcement in October 2018 of a goodwill impairment charge related to its power business. GE's stock has tumbled 44.4% year to date, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% has slipped 0.9%."}]}
