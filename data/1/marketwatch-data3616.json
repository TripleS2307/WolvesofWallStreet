She was always a science buff Birx grew up in Pennsylvania, where she and her two older brothers converted the backyard shed into a makeshift lab. Their most notable invention: a satellite-dish antenna that they moved around on roller skates, the Society for Science & the Public reported. When Birx was a junior at Carlisle High School in Pennsylvania, she competed in the 1973 International Science and Engineering Fair in San Diego. Her project on paleobotany in the Carboniferous period scored the trophy for girls grand champion, plus a chance to compete in the Army and Navy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s International Science and Engineering Fair (which she won). She eventually put herself through medical school at the Hershey School of Medicine at Penn State, the Hill reported. She has a military background Birx trained in internal medicine and clinical immunology at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center and the National Institutes of Health, according to her biography on the Department of State website. She began her government career as a military-trained clinician in immunology, mainly researching HIV/AIDS vaccines, in 1985. She attained the rank of colonel, and as Col. Birx received two prestigious U.S. Meritorious Service Medals and the Legion of Merit Award. She was named the director of the U.S. Military HIV Research Program at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, serving from 1996 to 2005. And she led \u00e2\u0080\u009cone of the most influential HIV vaccine trials in history,\u00e2\u0080\u009d her bio states.

Bush\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention When Bush announced his President\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in 2003, Birx flew back from Kenya and waited outside of the then-director of the Office of National AIDS Policy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s town house for almost a week to get a meeting with him. She had been working on HIV vaccine research in Africa for almost six years at that point.

Bush Presidential Center podcast in September. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was not leaving his office, and so I wore him down.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Birx was later appointed ambassador-at-large and global AIDS coordinator by President Barack Obama, and she has overseen PEPFAR at the State Department for the past six years.

Turns out, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of her tips for packing lightly and sticking to just one carry-on bag when traveling for work. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI take relatively plain dresses, black and other colors, that you can then change the scarves on, and through that it looks like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a totally different outfit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she told the Strategerist podcast last year.
