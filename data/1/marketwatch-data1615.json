Robyn Denholm, named chair in November 2018, is also chair of the audit committee. Tesla has scheduled its shareholder meeting for July 7 in Mountain View, Calif. Glass Lewis concerns centered around the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s directors and officers liability insurance policy and Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approval of an \u00e2\u0080\u009cunorthodox and potentially conflicting arrangement\u00e2\u0080\u009d not in the best interest of shareholders. Tesla has disclosed it did not renew its directors and officers liability insurance policy for the 2019-2020 year due to high premiums. Instead, Chief Executive Elon Musk agreed to personally provide equivalent coverage, with the other board members as third-party beneficiaries.

This is \u00e2\u0080\u009cparticularly concerning\u00e2\u0080\u009d because of Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ongoing shareholder concerns with the board\u00e2\u0080\u0099s independence, it said. ISS called for a shareholder vote against Denholm on concerns over the pledging of \u00e2\u0080\u009csignificant\u00e2\u0080\u009d amounts of stock by Tesla executives as collateral for personal loans. That calls into question the audit committee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cability to effectively oversee risk at the company,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and poses a risk to the investments of outside shareholders, ISS said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDirectors and executives with a pledged position may be forced to sell company stock (for example, to meet a margin call),\u00e2\u0080\u009d the adviser said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe forced sale of a significant amount of company stock may negatively impact the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stock price and may violate insider trading policies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Musk as well as directors Antonio Gracias, Musk\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brother Kimball Musk, and Chief Financial Officer Zach Kirkhorn have pledged shares as collateral to secure personal loans, and the aggregate number of pledged shares, about 4.9 million shares, has increased by 36% year-on-year, ISS said. Based on recent trading volumes, the market could absorb a sale of the pledged shares, \u00e2\u0080\u009chowever, the number of pledged shares as a percentage of the total shares outstanding is excessive and the value of the pledged shares, at approximately $7.9 billion, is significant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d ISS said. Tesla has a policy limiting pledging of company stock. Directors and executive officers may pledge their stock as collateral for loans and investments, and the maximum aggregate loan or investment amount collateralized cannot exceed 25% of the total value of the pledged stock.

The policy notwithstanding, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe aggregate value of the pledged position and the percentage of outstanding shares that is pledged raise significant concerns, which are exacerbated by the high degree of volatility in Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s share price,\u00e2\u0080\u009d ISS said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe increase in pledging activity at the company with the absence of a clear rationale and lack of a more robust anti-pledging policy call into question the audit committee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to effectively oversee risk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d ISS said. Denholm and newcomer Hiromichi Mizuno are the only audit committee members standing for election, but since Mizuno was appointed to the board in April, he should not be held accountable at this time, the adviser said. And shareholder votes against Denholm \u00e2\u0080\u009care further warranted due to consecutive years of high director pay without a reasonable rationale disclosed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d ISS said. Both advisers recommended to shareholders to vote for Musk and Mizuno as board members. Mizuno most recently served as executive managing director and chief investment officer of Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Government Pension Investment Fund. Denholm, a former telecommunications executive, was named board chair in November 2018 in the wake of a settlement between Musk and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over the CEO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cgoing private\u00e2\u0080\u009d tweets earlier that year. That deal required Musk to step aside as chairman for three years. Shares of Tesla have gained 135% this year, contrasting with losses of 3% and 8% for the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% \u00c2 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. DJIA, +0.56% \u00c2 The stock ended at a record high last Wednesday, and has given back some of those gains recently."}]}
