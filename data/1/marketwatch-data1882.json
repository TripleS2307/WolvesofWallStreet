Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg expressed frustration with the Trump administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s response to the coronavirus pandemic during a live chat Thursday with Dr. Anthony Fauci. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know, I was certainly sympathetic early on when it was clear that there would be some outbreaks no matter how well we handle this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Zuckerberg said during the hourlong interview, which was livestreamed on Facebook FB, +0.26% \u00c2 . \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut now that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re here in July, I just think that it was avoidable and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really disappointing that we still don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have adequate testing, that the credibility of the top scientists like yourself and the CDC is being undermined, and that until recently, parts of the administration were calling into question whether people should even follow basic best practices like wearing masks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Fauci did not criticize the Trump administration, but did take exception to the idea that containing COVID-19 and reopening the economy is a one-or-the-other predicament. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe should be looking at public health measures as a vehicle, or a gateway, to opening the country, not as the obstacle in the way, but as the gateway,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Fauci said, implying some states have reopened too soon. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have got to do it correctly. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t jump over steps, which is very perilous when you think about rebound. The proof of the pudding is, look what has happened. There really is no reason that we are having 40, 50, 60 thousand, other than we are not doing something correctly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Both Fauci and Zuckerberg agreed that the country needs to \u00e2\u0080\u009cregroup\u00e2\u0080\u009d to form an effective response to the latest pandemic developments, as cases have surged to record levels in many states in the South and West. Fauci also urged young people to take the pandemic more seriously. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have to have responsibility for yourself but also a societal responsibility that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting infected is not just you in a vacuum. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re propagating the pandemic,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, noting that hospitals are seeing more complications in young people infected by the virus. Fauci\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments came after some in the Trump administration, including the president, have increasingly criticized the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top infectious-diseases specialist. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro on Wednesday wrote an op-ed in USA Today blasting Fauci as being \u00e2\u0080\u009cwrong about everything.\u00e2\u0080\u009d USA Today on Thursday said the column should not have being published, saying it was misleading and failed the newspaper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fact-checking standards. Fauci dismissed the attack, telling The Atlantic: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI just want to do my job. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m really good at it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}]}
