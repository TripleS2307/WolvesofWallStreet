Some analysts worry a Senate procedural brawl over nominating and confirming a replacement for Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the U.S. Supreme Court will take lawmakers\u2019 attention away from already dicey fights over keeping the government open and approving more coronavirus aid. However, those deadlines are bearing down on Congress much faster than the need to confirm Ginsburg\u2019s replacement. The government\u2019s funding authority runs out on Sept. 30, and, without a stopgap bill to extend it, many federal agencies will shut down. There\u2019s no deadline for approving a second large coronavirus aid package, but prior to Ginsburg\u2019s death the assumed timeline on Capitol Hill was similar to the one for the so-called continuing resolution. Putting pressure on lawmakers is a threat by airlines that they will have to start mass layoffs in October without new help from Washington.

This isn\u2019t particularly tough policy and the framework hasn\u2019t really changed since the Spring. The Supreme Court fight is likely to take all the oxygen on Capitol Hill through November,\u201d he wrote in a client note. Larry Kudlow, director of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council, downplayed the impact of the Supreme Court fight. Asked Monday if he expected it to make it harder for lawmakers to focus on another COVID-19 bill, he said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to.\u201d House lawmakers were expected to unveil their stopgap spending bill Friday, but that was pushed to Monday. While analysts said a shutdown was still unlikely, getting the bill through the House and the Senate, the latter of which is scheduled now to be out of session Monday and Tuesday, in time to avoid a shutdown Thursday depends on there emerging no procedural hiccups. Failing to get a stopgap bill done, though, would likely mean blowback for both parties. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody wants to be responsible for shutting down the government on the eve of an election in the middle of a pandemic,\u201d said Rep. Tom Cole, an Oklahoma Republican, last week. Read more: One way to end coronavirus aid standoff? Add parts of a deal to stopgap funding bill"}]}
