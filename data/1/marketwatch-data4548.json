The videoconferencing company, which boomed to prominence early in the coronavirus shutdown, said in a blog post Wednesday that all users, including those on its free/basic tier, will soon receive end-to-end encryption as an optional feature, with a beta version launching in July. Zoom ZM, +2.89% launched end-to-end encryption in May, but only for subscribers who paid $14.99 a month for its premium tier. Video calls for free-tier users currently use less-secure transport encryption, which will still be the default setting. In April, Zoom was rocked by user complaints and a shareholder lawsuit that accused it of misleading customers by overstating its security measures, following a wave of so-called \u201cZoom bombers\u201d who hacked into videoconferences. Shares plunged as a number of companies and local government agencies dropped the service. Earlier this month, Zoom said it could not offer the stronger end-to-end encryption to free-tier users in case it needed to comply with subpoenas from police or the FBI, a statement that angered more users, Bloomberg News reported. But in a blog post Wednesday, Zoom Chief Executive Eric Yuan said the company has \u201cengaged with civil liberties organizations, our CISO council, child safety advocates, encryption experts, government representatives, our own users, and others to gather their feedback on this feature. \u201cWe are also pleased to share that we have identified a path forward that balances the legitimate right of all users to privacy and the safety of users on our platform. This will enable us to offer E2EE as an advanced add-on feature for all of our users around the globe \u2014 free and paid \u2014 while maintaining the ability to prevent and fight abuse on our platform.\u201d To access the higher level of security, users will have to undergo a one-time verification process, such as through a text message. Consumer Reports praised Zoom\u2019s decision late Wednesday, saying it could have a domino effect raising security standards for the wider marketplace. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see Zoom reverse its decision to only allow paying customers to have their conversations safeguarded with end-to-end encryption,\u201d Justin Brookman, director of privacy and technology policy for Consumer Reports, said in an emailed statement. \u201cSecurity shouldn\u2019t be a luxury just for those who can afford it. I hope others in the industry will follow the example of Zoom in giving all users the same ability to communicate privately and securely.\u201d The Electronic Freedom Foundation also approved of the move. \u201cZoom has done the right thing, changed course, and taken a big step forward for privacy and security,\u201d the organization said Wednesday. \u201cWe applaud Zoom\u2019s decision to make privacy and security enhancements available to all of their hundreds of millions of users.\u201d Both Consumer Reports and the EFF urged Zoom to take the further step of protecting the phone numbers provided for authentication from third-party marketers. They also called for enterprise services from rivals such as Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO, +0.15% , Slack Technologies Inc. WORK, +3.36% and Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +2.48% to follow suit and give the highest level of security to free users. Zoom Video shares hit an all-time high Tuesday, closing above $242 a share. Its stock slipped Wednesday, but is still up nearly 250% year to date, compared to the S&P 500\u2019s SPX, +0.87% 3.6% decline this year."}]}
