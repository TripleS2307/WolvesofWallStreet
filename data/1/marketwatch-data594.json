Here\u2019s something that caught my eye: Without Social Security, more than 40% of elderly Americans would live in poverty. More than 40%. That\u2019s according to an analysis by the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), which says the data underscores just how important Social Security is, and without it, how millions of Americans would slip into destitution. Kathleen Romig, CBPP senior policy analyst, says the 40% estimate is based on the official federal poverty level of about $12,000 for a single person. But this may be understating the true level of poverty, given that some economists say the $12,000 figure is unrealistically low\u2014and peg the true figure at twice that amount: About $24,000. Meantime, Romig says the poverty figures could be skewed in another way, thanks to the coronavirus pandemic. 80% of older Americans can't afford to retire - COVID-19 isn't helping Why? Because \u201cthe SSA (Social Security Administration) shutdown its field offices (roughly 1,200 of them) six months ago and moved online. That makes sense,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause it\u2019s not safe for SSA employees and its beneficiaries who are disproportionately vulnerable to this virus, since they\u2019re primarily elderly and disabled.\u201d But moving online has likely kept countless citizens who have become eligible for benefits from applying. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t know they\u2019re eligible, or just can\u2019t handle the application process on their own.\u201d So at the very time when people need help the most, it\u2019s harder to get it. The result? Suffering, and for some, the descent into poverty likely ensues. \u201cIt\u2019s awful,\u201d Romig says simply. Some context here: Those 1,200 SSA offices serve some 40 million people a year, and thus have \u201chave enormous reach in normal times,\u201d says Romig. In the past, when one field office closed for whatever reason, \u201capplications went down in that community.\u201d So when all 1,200 close for half-a-year \u2014 and counting \u2014 the number of people affected is huge. This situation seems destined to continue for at least several more months, given data that shows the pandemic\u2014after taking some 200,000 lives already\u2014now shows possibility of entering a dreaded \u201csecond wave\u201d. Cases have risen at least 10% in the past week in 31 states, according to data released over the weekend by Johns Hopkins University. A second wave could inflict further damage on the U.S. economy, which has only partially recovered from an epic second quarter collapse that sent GDP plunging at a 32% pace and throwing tens of millions of Americans out of work. (Second waves often occur during flu season. It\u2019s unclear at this time whether a coronavirus like SARS-CoV-2 will lead to a second wave of infections.) Remember: When people don\u2019t work, neither they nor their employers pay payroll taxes, which is how Social Security is financed. So less money\u2014a lot less\u2014has been coming in. But it\u2019s going out at the same rate. Little wonder then, that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said earlier this month that the $2.9 trillion Social Security surplus\u2014previously forecast to run out in 2035, will now run out in 2031. That\u2019s four years faster than previously estimated. What might happen to this timetable if a second wave of the pandemic took root, forcing companies to engage in a second round of layoffs and furloughs? Social Security\u2019s increasingly precarious position hasn\u2019t exactly escaped voters\u2019 attention. In fact, according to a recent survey by Data for Progress, a progressive think tank, more people listed the prevention of Social Security cuts as a top issue than anything else\u2014anything else. Yet much of the media, with its focus on politics as nothing more than a horse race\u2014who\u2019s ahead, who\u2019s behind?\u2014has barely focused on this. It should. There\u2019s no single federal program that is more essential, and impacts more people, more regularly. And when I say Social Security is \u201cessential,\u201d here\u2019s what I mean. As of June, according to data provided by the Social Security Administration: \u2022 Social Security benefits are about 33% of all elderly income. \u2022 Among elderly Social Security beneficiaries, 50% of married couples and 70% of unmarried persons receive 50% or more of their income from Social Security. \u2022 Among elderly Social Security beneficiaries, 21% of married couples and about 45% of unmarried persons rely on Social Security for 90% or more of their income. Social Security isn\u2019t just essential. It\u2019s utterly essential. Millions of older Americans already live in, or near, poverty. If the politicians\u2014and the people who vote for them\u2014aren\u2019t careful, millions more could join them."}]}
