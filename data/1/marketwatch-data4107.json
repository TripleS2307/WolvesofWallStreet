HPE HPE, -1.80% reported non-GAAP earnings of 32 cents a share, compared with non-GAAP earnings of 45 cents a share in the year-ago quarter. Revenue declined 5% to $6.82 billion from $7.2 billion a year ago. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected adjusted earnings of 23 cents a share on revenue of $6.06 billion. \u201cWe significantly improved operational and supply-chain execution and advanced our innovation agenda with the introduction of HPE GreenLake cloud-services solutions, our new HPE Ezmeral software portfolio, and our planned acquisition of SD-WAN leader Silver Peak,\u201d HPE Chief Executive Antonio Neri said in a statement. \u201cWe were very pleased with the performance, especially in reducing our backlog $500 million,\u201d HPE Chief Financial Officer Tarek Robbiati told MarketWatch in a phone interview after the results were announced. In a sign of the company\u2019s confidence, it issued earnings guidance for its current fourth-quarter of non-GAAP EPS of between 32 cents and 36 cents a share \u2014 squarely above FactSet estimates of 31 cents a share. HPE expects to be \u201cback operating in a much more stable position\u201d the next few quarters, Robbiati added. He pointed to revenue for high-end computing systems, which improved 3% to $649 million. For the just completed third quarter, compute revenue was flat at $3.4 billion, while storage sales declined 10% to $1.1 billion as enterprise companies continued to keep a tight leash on big purchases during an economic downturn caused by the pandemic. \u201cIt\u2019s always painful reorienting a company around services, but HPE so far is doing an admirable job,\u201d Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, said in an message. \u201cGreenlake (services) is a bet the company play and it\u2019s nice to see things coming together.\u201d HPE shares are down 41% this year. The broader S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% has improved 6.6% in 2020."}]}
