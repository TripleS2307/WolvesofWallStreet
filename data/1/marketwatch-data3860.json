Speaking at a White House briefing, Trump said there could be a coronavirus vaccine as soon as October, citing work by Pfizer PFE, -0.27% and other companies. There is doubt about such a timeline, however, with one expert telling CNN that possible end-of-October delivery is \"simply wrong.\" The number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 world-wide rose above 26.4 million on Friday with the U.S. accounting for about a quarter of that total."}]}
