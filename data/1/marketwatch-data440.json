The operator of branded business parks in Germany said it has collected 97.2% of the rent for the six months ended Sept. 30, despite the coronavirus pandemic, and that it expects to continue to collect the outstanding rent over the next 12 months. Total annualized rent roll was 89.2 million euros ($104.7 million) for the period, from EUR78.5 million a year earlier, while the number of enquiries rose by 17.4% year-on-year. Like-for-like occupancy slipped slightly to 83.9% from 85.2% on March 31, largely due to known move-outs. However, the average rental rate rose to EUR6.03 a square meter from EUR5.96, said the London-listed company. \"We have a strong balance sheet providing significant firepower, which we will be deploying on our pipeline of acquisitions and investing in the existing portfolio to attract new tenants and grow rents,\" Chief Executive Andrew Coombs said. The company didn't provide any figures regarding management expectations for fiscal 2020. Write to Joe Hoppe at joseph.hoppe@wsj.com"}]}
