DNKN, +1.26% reported Thursday a second-quarter adjusted profit that fell below expectations, but revenue that fell less than forecast, and said that it was reinstating its dividend program. The coffee seller's stock was still inactive in the premarket. Net income fell to $36.5 million, or 44 cents a share, from $72.4 million, or 71 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share declined to 49 cents from 86 cents, below the FactSet consensus of 50 cents. Revenue fell 20% to $287.4 million but beat the FactSet consensus of $278.3 million. U.S Dunkin' same-store sales dropped 18.7%, as a decline in traffic resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic offset an increase in the average ticket, which was driven by a shift to family-size bulk orders and snacking. Baskin-Robbins U.S. same-store sales fell 6.0%. Separately, Dunkin' announced a dividend of 40.25 cents a share, payable Sept. 9 to shareholders of record on Sept. 1. The stock has lost 5.1% year to date through Wednesday, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% has edged up 0.9%."}]}
