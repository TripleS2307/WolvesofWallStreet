Asana ASAN, -3.12% began trading at 12:35 p.m. Eastern time at a price of around $27, for a valuation of roughly $4.1 billion. The New York Stock Exchange set a reference price of $21 for the stock. Less than 15 minutes after their first trade, Asana shares were up about 40%, and closed up 37% at $28.80, following an intraday high of $29.96. At 1:40 p.m. Eastern, Palantir PLTR, -0.50% shares started trading, bolting out of the gate, rising more than 50% higher than the reference price. Shares finished up 31% at $9.50, following an intraday high of $11.42. NYSE had set a reference price of $7.25 a share based on private-market trades of the stock, and The Wall Street Journal reported last week that the company expected shares to open around $10. Reference prices for direct listings are based on trading prices in private markets ahead of companies filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a public listing. Direct listings differ from IPOs because there is no capital raised, which is what places a dollar figure on shares in an IPO. Direct listings are largely expected to trade higher than the reference price. Asana is a collaboration-software company co-founded by Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, who serves as chief executive, while Palantir is a data-software company co-founded by early Facebook FB, +0.26% investor and board member Peter Thiel. Both companies chose to list their shares directly instead of selling new stock in an initial public offering, a route that was previously taken by Spotify Technology SA SPOT, +0.08% and Slack Technologies Inc. WORK, +3.36%, which were also mature startups that sold shares repeatedly in the private markets and were looking to provide investors with public trading options. In an interview Wednesday with MarketWatch, Palantir Chief Operating Officer Shyam Sankar said the company made the decision to go public about midway through 2019, with an eye on the back half of 2021. After the pandemic struck, he said the company sped up its timeline to Wall Street. \u201cCOVID really accelerated the business and it became clear it was a time for us to think about\u201d going public sooner, Sankar said. Sankar called the direct listing \u201cmomentous\u201d and \u201cexciting,\u201d and said the company made the decision to list instead of perform an IPO because it did not need capital but did want to offer investors a chance to cash in on their stake. \u201cWe have had incredibly patient investors \u2014 especially our most important ones, employees \u2014 and this gives them more access to the market immediately,\u201d he said. Palantir launched its first software platform in 2008, and was long known as a secretive software startup focused on military and law-enforcement issues, courting controversy for its work with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement division of the U.S. government. The company has since launched a second offering that has attracted clients from the private sector, and grown much more vocal about its business, including a public divorce from Silicon Valley in which co-founder and Chief Executive Alexander Karp detailed a move away from California and defended his company\u2019s work for the government.

The company also reported that losses grew, to $118.6 million in fiscal 2020 from $50.9 million in fiscal 2019. \u201cWe\u2019re happy with the results, but truthfully it is one day of many,\u201d Asana Chief Financial Officer Tim Wan told MarketWatch on Wednesday. \u201cOur focus, long term, is providing value to our 82,000 customers.\u201d COVID has presented both benefits and challenges, Wan said. An influx of so-called knowledge workers at home has put a premium on available digital tools to help them organize tasks efficiently, which is Asana\u2019s business proposition. The challenge is that an unspecified number of Asana\u2019s customers are small businesses that have adopted its technology and are suffering through an economic downturn caused by the pandemic. \u201cMany of our customers adopt our technology in a bottoms-up manner, and there has been a churn among them because of the pandemic,\u201d Wan said.
