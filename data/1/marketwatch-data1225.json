Travelers and tourists are staying away from the U.K. \u00e2\u0080\u009cin droves\u00e2\u0080\u009d because of continuing uncertainty around travel restrictions designed to curb the spread of COVID-19, the report by the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) found. As a result, international visitor spending this year could plunge by 78% compared with 2019 levels, equating to a loss of \u00c2\u00a360 million ($79 million) a day, or \u00c2\u00a3420 million a week, to the U.K. economy, according to WTTC estimates. Read:Global tourism loses $320 billion in first five months of 2020, says UN Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said the bleak outlook for the travel and tourism sector has been reflected in the stock market. \u201c Travel and tourism was responsible for almost 4 million U.K. jobs in 2019. \u201d Carnival CCL, +0.51%, the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest cruise company, and budget airline easyJet EZJ, +0.09% \u00c2 exited the FTSE 100 earlier this year after a major collapse in their share prices. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor easyJet, there has been a slight recovery this month after bookings came in higher than expected but with some travel corridors closed once again, it is clear the challenges are far from over,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Streeter said. On Wednesday, Carnival\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Princess Cruises said that two cruises set to sail in early 2021 would be canceled, blaming border restrictions and the \u00e2\u0080\u009ccontinued uncertainty of airline travel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe share in the disappointment of this cancellation for guests of our world cruises because it is a pinnacle cruise vacation experience, booked by some of our most loyal guests,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jan Swartz, Princess Cruises president,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said in a statement. Carnival said guests currently booked on these canceled voyages will receive a \u00e2\u0080\u009crefundable Future Cruise Credit (FCC)\u00e2\u0080\u009d equivalent to 100% of the cruise fare plus an additional nonrefundable FCC equal to 25% of the cruise fare paid.

Earlier in August, Ryanair RYA, -2.60%, Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest airline, announced that it would reduce its flight capacity by 20% during September and October due to a fall in bookings. \u00e2\u0080\u009cVisitors from France and Spain who may have planned a weekend long city break to the U.K. will now postpone or cancel, given the freshly imposed quarantine rules. Other European tourists may also stay away, not wanting to run the risk of being confined to hotel rooms if new restrictions are brought in,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Streeter added. According to WTTC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2020 Economic Impact Report, during 2019, travel and tourism was responsible for almost 4 million U.K. jobs, or 11% of the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s total workforce. It also generated nearly \u00c2\u00a3200 billion to the U.K. economy last year \u00e2\u0080\u0094 around 9% of GDP. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe urgently need to replace stop-start quarantine measures with rapid, comprehensive and cost-effective test and trace programs at departure points across the country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Gloria Guevara, WTTC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief executive. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis investment will be significantly less than the impact of blunt quarantines which have devastating and far-reaching socioeconomic consequences,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added.
