The conversation was first reported by National Public Radio.\u00c2 But it is a dying wish that, if President Donald Trump has his way, will go unfulfilled. A sitting president has every right to nominate whomever he (or she) wants for the high court of course, and Trump, coincidentally just days ago, floated several deeply conservative names.\u00c2 Breaking news: Trump says he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll name Supreme Court pick on Friday or Saturday What happens now? Democrats tried and failed to stop Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first two nominees, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, from being confirmed. The Kavanaugh fight was particularly brutal and drawn-out, after allegations of sexual misconduct were leveled by no less than three women. The White House will have to do a better job of vetting if it wants to avoid an embarrassing rerun of that mess.The math The math hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t changed. Democrats, on paper, still lack the votes to stop Trump. However, several variables come into play. For starters, the three key Republican players\u00e2\u0080\u0094Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, are all up for re-election in November. Two of them\u00e2\u0080\u0094Trump and Graham\u00e2\u0080\u0094look to be in trouble. In politics, self-preservation is always job one. Trump and Graham are worried about saving their skin (McConnell looks in better shape in his race), and perhaps may not be able to spend as much time on a pre-election confirmation as many people seem to assume. This suggests the real fight will come after the election is decided.\u00c2 Also read: Biden to senators: Extinguish the \u00e2\u0080\u0098flames\u00e2\u0080\u0099 engulfing U.S. politics by not \u00e2\u0080\u0098jamming\u00e2\u0080\u0099 through a Supreme Court justice Usually, these things play out over many weeks. Over the last half-century it has taken about 10 weeks\u00e2\u0080\u009471 days to be exact\u00e2\u0080\u0094for the average nominee to be confirmed. Kavanaugh\u00e2\u0080\u0099s confirmation, at 89 days, was an outlier.\u00c2 \u00c2 But this is 2020. Graham has shown himself to be such a craven hypocrite, so contemptuous and disrespectful of the Senate procedures he once claimed to revere, that he could just schedule a quick Judiciary Committee vote and ram Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nominee through. Who cares what Democrats think? Republicans have the votes.\u00c2 That would send the nomination to the full Senate itself for a final vote, and again, Republicans, with\u00c2 53 seats, have the votes.\u00c2 \u00c2 Democrats need defections The only hope Democrats\u00c2 have here is for four Republican senators to buck the party line and slow things down. Already there are two. Maine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Susan Collins, whose re-election bid is in serious trouble because of her support for Kavanaugh in 2018), says she won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t vote to back a nominee so close to election\u00e2\u0080\u0094nor would she in a lame duck if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a change in presidents. \u00c2 Alaska\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Lisa Murkowski is also not on board. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would not vote to confirm a Supreme Court nominee,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said Friday.\u00c2 That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s two Republican senators who aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t on the Trump train. That brings the Republican vote to 51\u00e2\u0080\u0094one more than the 50 they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d need to put Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pick on the court.\u00c2 50? Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they need a majority of 51? No. Because a 50-50 tie, should that occur, would be broken by Vice President Mike Pence.\u00c2 So it would appear that Republicans are in pretty good shape. But are they? Consider that Utah\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Mitt Romney\u00e2\u0080\u0094the only Republican senator who voted to convict in Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impeachment trial\u00e2\u0080\u0094could stick it to the president once again. That brings the GOP tally down to 50, but that would still be safe, given the Pence tiebreaker. \u00c2 \u00c2 Colorado\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Cory Gardner could also bolt. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in a very tough re-election fight in a state that rejected Trump in 2016. Voting to ram through Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nominee wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly help his prospects back home.\u00c2 \u00c2 Neither Romney nor Gardner have said what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do. McConnell needs to corral just one of them.\u00c2 A mess What happens if a nominee isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t approved\u00c2 by Election Day? Then it could really get messy. First, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re\u00c2 probably not going to know who the next president will be on Nov. 3, and we might not know for a few weeks.\u00c2 The 2000 Gore-Bush debacle dragged on for five weeks, after all\u00e2\u0080\u0094and that was because of a dispute in just one state: Florida.\u00c2 The way things are shaping up this year, there could be simultaneous, postelection messes in numerous\u00c2 states.\u00c2 Meanwhile, the electoral college is scheduled to be certified on Dec. 14. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 84 days from now.\u00c2 What if Biden wins? What if Democrats\u00c2 take the Senate? And consider Arizona, where Democrat Mark Kelly will almost certainly crush Republican Martha McSally, who was appointed to finish the term of the late Sen. John McCain. Kelly could be sworn in as early as Nov. 30, according to Arizona election experts\u00e2\u0080\u0094and vote down Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pick.\u00c2 \u00c2 When conservative Justice Antonin Scalia died in February 2016, Barack Obama was a lame-duck president. Remember what happened next? McConnell said the vacancy should be filled by the next president. So he sat on the nomination of Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nominee, Merrick Garland, and the seat wound up getting filled by Gorsuch. McConnell bet big\u00e2\u0080\u0094and won big.\u00c2 But unlike Obama, Trump is not a lame duck. He could win again. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the difference, Republicans argue. And they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re right. But if he loses to Joe Biden, what becomes of their argument then?\u00c2 Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what becomes of it: Nothing. McConnell has already said he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all in on pushing a nominee through. As for Graham, after saying in 2016 that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d oppose a Republican president trying to fill a vacancy in the last year of the first term, he reneged on his words on Saturday. It may very well be that in a city where men of principle are few and far between, that Graham is the lowest of them all.\u00c2 These are men\u00e2\u0080\u0094Trump, McConnell, Graham\u00e2\u0080\u0094who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give a hoot what you think about any of this. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all about the raw exercise of power. Nothing more, nothing less. They intend to exercise it now. But they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d better hurry.\u00c2 Suggested reading: Ruth Bader Ginsburg played a pivotal role in the women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s-rights era\u00e2\u0080\u0094and that was before she joined the Supreme Court Amy Coney Barrett emerges as Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s front-runner to fill Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Supreme Court seat"}]}
