POOL/AFP via Getty Images The Federal Reserve is announcing its latest interest-rate decision on Wednesday, and expectations aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t for a big shift at this meeting. More on that later. Still the big issue in the world of central banking is last month\u00e2\u0080\u0099s official pivot to average inflation targeting. That is, the Fed is saying inflation will be allowed to run over 2% if \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as it has \u00e2\u0080\u0094 price growth has been under that target for a significant period. Now the Fed didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really explain how it would implement this new strategy in practice. Tim Duy, the University of Oregon professor who writes the Fed Watch blog, says the benefit of that new shift comes when the economy is running faster than expected. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s particularly important in the context of a recovery that appears more rapid than anticipated. Along with the more rapid recovery is a faster pace of inflation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says. Already, the price level is looking to be returning to its pre-COVID trend. But the market, thanks to the Fed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new guidance, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t shifting its expectations on interest rates. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow we are thinking that there is nothing in the data to prompt a more hawkish reaction from the Fed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Duy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Fed is content to allow real interest rates to continue to drop and presumably content to allow them to fall even a notch further than the last cycle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d There is a risk in this strategy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Fed is committed to fighting the last battle, the long, slow recovery experienced in the wake of the Great Recession [2007-09 recession]. The Fed is absolutely unprepared for any outcomes on the right-hand side of the distribution. That opens up the risk that the Fed finds itself pivoting in 12 months or sooner,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Duy. Another risk is the increased importance put on financial stability in the strategy change. Like the average inflation targeting, the Fed didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say how it would put that emphasis into practice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou kind of have to wonder what happens if the Fed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commitment to maintaining deeply negative interest rates keeps the heat up under risk assets as you might expect it to,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Duy. The buzz The Federal Reserve decision is due at 2 p.m. Eastern, followed by Chairman Jerome Powell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s press conference at 2:30 p.m. Traders will be focusing on the Fed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new forecasts on interest rates, economic growth and unemployment, as well as Powell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments on the outlook, and the central bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Main Street lending program that so far has been barely used. Read: Fed to signal interest-rate hikes won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be an issue until 2024 \u00e2\u0080\u009cJerome Powell will use the press conference to reinforce the message that the Fed has no interest in raising interest rates anytime in the next couple of years, which should help to anchor the short-end of the yield curve even more sturdily,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING.
