The bank said it had net income of $1.3 billion, or 50 cents a share, in the quarter, down from $4.8 billion, or $1.95 a share, in the same period a year ago. Revenue rose to $19.8 billion from $18.8 billion. The FactSet consensus was for EPS of 35 cents and revenue of $19.1 billion. Revenue was boosted by a strong performance in fixed income markets and investment banking, which offset weakness in consumer banking as consumers eased spending during the coronavirus pandemic. Net income was hurt by a huge bump in loan loss reserves, reflecting Citi's deteriorating macro-economic outlook. \"While credit costs weighed down our net income, our overall business performance was strong during the quarter, and we have been able to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic reasonably well,\" Chief Executive Michael Corbat said in a statement. Loan loss reserves rose to $26.4 billion from $12.5 billion a year ago, and cost of credit jumped to $7.9 billion from $2.1 billion. Shares have fallen 34.7% in the year to date, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% has fallen 8.6% and the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% has fallen 2.3%."}]}
