The Federal Reserve on Wednesday announced it was taking an enforcement action against Citigroup Inc., the holding company, demanding that the bank correct \u201cseveral longstanding deficiencies.\u201d In a statement, the Fed announced a cease-and-desist order that requires Citigroup C, +0.47% to enhance its firm-wide risk management and internal controls. The reforms have to be quarterbacked by the firms board of directors. \u201cAmong other things, the firm has not taken prompt and effective actions to correct practices previously identified by the Fed Board in the areas of compliance risk management, data quality management, and internal controls,\u201d the central bank statement said. A related action was taken by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which oversees Citibank, the firm\u2019s national bank. In a statement, the OCC said it has assessed a $400 million civil money penalty against Citibank related to the same deficient records. In 2013, Citigroup entered into an consent agreement with the Fed to clean up its anti-money-laundering compliance program. Two years later, the firm entered into an order to strengthen in Citigroup\u2019s compliance and control in foreign exchange activities. In a statement, Citi, which had to agree to the consent orders, said it was \u201cdisappointed that we have fallen short in our regulators expectations.\u201d"}]}
