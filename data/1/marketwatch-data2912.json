Among those watching was former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the previous presidential candidate to face off with Donald Trump on a debate stage back in 2016 - and she has some thoughts about last night's debate debacle. Tuesday night's chaotic debate saw President Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden insulting each other, interrupting each other and often straying from the agreed-upon topics. And while both men interrupted each other, by Slate's count, Trump interrupted Biden at least 128 times, compared with Biden interrupting \"dozens\" of times. Biden got so exasperated early into the roughly 90-minute debate that he said, \"Will you shut up, man\" - which quickly became the line of the night.

While many viewers lamented that political discourse has boiled down to the candidates insulting each other rather than speaking about the issues most important to the American public during a health and economic crisis, some wished that Clinton had also told Trump to \"shush\" or \"keep yapping man\" like Biden did back when she faced off with Trump in 2016 - when by Slate's count, Trump interrupted her at least 51 times during the first debate.

My skin crawled,\" she wrote in her 2017 memoir \"What Happened,\" adding that she thought of turning around to tell Trump to back off, with a dismissive line such as, \"I know you love to intimidate women, but you can't intimidate me.\" But she ultimately decided against it.
