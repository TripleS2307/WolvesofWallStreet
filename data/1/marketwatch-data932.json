In the new book, \u201cWhat Retirees Want: A Holistic View of Life\u2019s Third Age,\u201d authors Ken Dychtwald and Robert Morison swing for the fences with a sweeping review of the conception and perception of retirement and pinpoints what lies ahead. The premise: Boomers are redefining retirement. Those of you who are hip to Dychtwald, founder and chief executive of Age Wave, a consulting and research company, will appreciate, as always, his deep research, statistics, and analysis. There\u2019s commentary and insights from leading aging and work experts. Full disclosure: I was interviewed for the book. \u201cWhat Retirees Want\u201d is grounded on surveys of over 100,000 boomers. The authors round the bases tagging critical facets of retirement\u2014family, financial security, health, housing, leisure, philanthropy, work, and yes, happiness. And, of course, they address the insidious culture of ageism that older adults typically confront on a daily basis. In one chapter, for example, the authors show how marketers routinely misjudge or parody retirees and other older Americans and discuss how they could remedy this problem. \u201cAgeism continues to blind marketers and prevent them from seeing the growth potential of the retiree market,\u201d they write. Longer and, hopefully, healthier lives, have and will continue to transform our last decades in myriad ways. While each of us have a unique set of circumstances, Dychtwald and Morison are realistically optimistic about what lies ahead. \u201cThe boomers have famously\u2014or infamously\u2014reshaped every stage of life they\u2019ve inhabited,\u201d they write. \u201cTheir early years caused a market boom in baby products. Their teenage years gave rise to the hippie movement. They activated sexual and gender revolutions. They reshaped the workforce with unprecedented numbers of women.\u201d Their reasoning continues: \u201cInterested from the start in discovering themselves and finding purpose, they grew up with major causes\u2014civil rights, women\u2019s rights, gay rights, opposition to war\u2014and defining events\u2014the assassinations of two Kennedys and Dr. Martin Luther King, the rebellious freedom of Woodstock, and the wonder of the moon landing.\u201d Little wonder then that boomers want their retirement to be \u201cmore interesting, active, passion-filled, and exciting\u2026. the story of youth\u2019s excitement was baked into them,\u201d they write. \u201cAnd now they really don\u2019t want to become \u201cold\u201d people, certainly not by conventional definition.\u201d While the book is a sweeping tutorial on the shifting sands of retirement, the overriding message that I was left with is one of possibilities for retirees. \u201cCompared with previous generations of older adults, they are better educated, more high-spirited, more willing to experiment, more willing to change things,\u201d they write. \u201cThroughout their lives, boomers have had an ambitious appetite for breaking rules of all sorts and experimenting with a diverse range of lifestyles. We are convinced that these proclivities will be central to their retirements.\u201d I was pleased to see the special nod to boomer women, a cohort that includes me. \u201cIt\u2019s also critical to note that boomer women are more educated, skilled, ambitious, and confident than any previous generation of women,\u201d they write. \u201cThey were the first generation to step out of the homemaker pattern, where the husband worked and eventually retired, and the wife managed the home and family. Instead, they pursued higher education and careers and were also willing to leave unsatisfying marriages. Boomer women\u2019s experience in decision making and financial matters will most likely serve them well in retirement, because on average the married will outlive their husbands.\u201d The authors are clear, however, that one-size does not fit all. There are \u201cAgeless Explorers, who see retirement as a time of opportunity, adventure, exploration, and personal reinvention,\u201d they write. And then there are the \u201cComfortably Contents,\u201d who \u201capproach retirement with a more traditional, less driven view that retirement is a reward for a life of conscientious work,\u201d they write. \u201cThey tend to be well-educated and their work provided a good income. They are less likely to work in retirement. Their focus is on recreation, fun, and relaxation.\u201d Next, the \u201cLive for Todays\u201d who \u201cseek continued personal growth and want to keep reinventing themselves. They have the biggest list of things they\u2019d like to do and would ideally like their retirement to be an extension of their free-spirited lives,\u201d according to the authors. Finally, there are the \u201dWorried Strugglers,\u201d who \u201chave fewer financial resources and fewer hopes and dreams for what they\u2019d like to do. They report being more worried, less active, less healthy, and less happy. Financially, they have done relatively little planning and preparation,\u201d the authors write. Retirement is far from stepping back for many retirees in this new third age. \u201cIncreasingly, today\u2019s retirees are exploring, not retreating,\u201d they note. \u201cMore and more have renewed purpose and new, often higher ambitions in retirement.\u201d One perfect example: the authors interview one of my go-to experts, Paul Irving, 68, Irving once led a major Los Angeles-based law and consulting firm. After 26 years there, he applied and was accepted as a 2010 fellow at Harvard\u2019s Advanced Leadership Initiative for experienced leaders. \u201cThe latest act of his career, in his third age, includes chairing the Milken Institute Center for the Future of Aging,\u201d the authors explain. When they asked Irving to elaborate on why he decided to step off and head back to school he told them: \u201cWhile I loved my time as a lawyer, I felt that there was something else ahead. It was a sense that I wasn\u2019t done. Part of it was love of learning and challenge.\u201d He credits his year in Cambridge with helping him make that successful transition. \u201cI couldn\u2019t say the specific education was critical,\u201d he once told me. \u201cBut it did get people thinking about me in a different way and me thinking about myself in a different way\u2014instead of just being a lawyer.\u201d Boomer retirees aren\u2019t slowing falling off the merry-go-round. \u201cRather, they want to continue to become better versions of themselves,\u201d they write. \u201cThat\u2019s the new story of aging and retirement.\u201d Retiring is a sequence of shifts over time, as Dychtwald, told me when we spoke about this topic last fall. \u201cFor most of the changes in our lives there is ritual,\u201d he said. \u201cIn high school, when you contemplated college, you visited campuses. There\u2019s counseling. When it comes to retirement, people are basically told \u2018good luck, have a good time.\u2019 \u2018 I think it\u2019s really a psychological metamorphosis. During this transitional period, some people still feel unsettled, anxious or bored, but eventually they realize that \u2018I can be fresh. I can be new.\u2019\u201d Kerry Hannon is a leading expert and strategist on work and jobs, entrepreneurship, personal finance and retirement.
