(Walter Freeman via AP) Since Celeste Coughlin returned to Bloomington, Ind. a few weeks ago for her senior year at Indiana University, she\u2019s been taking whatever steps she can to keep herself safe from the coronavirus pandemic. Coughlin stocked up on masks and sanitizing products. She\u2019s sketched out a plan to try to get tested for COVID-19 every week. She dropped a class important to her degree progress to ensure she\u2019d only be taking courses remotely. If it were up to Coughlin, the school wouldn\u2019t have offered any face-to-face undergraduate classes except to students whose citizenship or residential status depended on attending class in person. \u201cThere is clear evidence about the dangers of returning to campus and welcoming students back,\u201d she said, pointing to prominent outbreaks at other schools. So seeing school officials adopt what she described as a paternalistic tone toward students after photos of off-campus parties circulated widely on social media was just one of the ways the school\u2019s approach to the pandemic has \u201cthoroughly disappointed\u201d her, Coughlin said. The school\u2019s provost, Lauren Robel, wrote in a communication to students: \u201cif enough of you don\u2019t follow the rules, game over. We\u2019ll have to do what other universities have done and go all online.\u201d \u201cWe are well on our way to seeing some very serious consequences in our community as a result of their lack of leadership,\u201d Coughlin said of school officials. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to put the blame on the university because they do such a good job of putting responsibility on students.\u201d So far, IU hasn\u2019t seen the level of positive cases that sent students at other schools back to remote instruction or even home earlier in August \u2014 after testing more than 39,000 students upon arrival to campus, the school had a positivity rate of 0.91 percent, as of the week of Aug. 24. Chuck Carney, an IU spokesman, wrote in an emailed statement that officials \u201cwouldn\u2019t want students to think that it\u2019s only they who are responsible for conducting themselves in a way to keep things on track.\u201d Still, he said the off-campus parties, \u201cviolated state, county, and city COVID-19 health regulations. At that point, we needed to emphasize to the minority of students who were potentially putting our community in danger of viral spread that we all had to follow these guidelines.\u201d Colleges are telegraphing to students that their behavior is key to preventing outbreaks IU\u2019s message in response to the parties is one of many that have been circulated by college officials across the country over the past few weeks telegraphing to students that their behavior is key to preventing outbreaks on campus. But students are making their decisions in an environment established and controlled by the institutions, experts have noted. Though individuals of course have a role to play in keeping themselves and their communities safe, universities, facing revenue shortfalls and political pressure, invited students back assuring them that they were taking steps to prevent the spread of COVID. What\u2019s more, adopting a tone of blame towards students during this period could actually make it more difficult to prevent an outbreak on campus, some experts say. \u201cIt\u2019s both unfair and it\u2019s also incredibly counterproductive,\u201d Joshua Salomon , the director of the Prevention Policy Modeling Lab at Stanford University, said of universities pointing to student behavior amid COVID concerns. \u201cIf students are afraid that they\u2019re going to get punished, then it\u2019s going to make them less likely to disclose that they have been at risk and it\u2019s going to make the contact tracing much harder.\u201d The messages come after months of preparation by colleges to shift responsibility for COVID outbreaks from themselves to students. Many schools that have brought students back to campus have seen an escalation in cases, and some have even switched to remote instruction. The prevalence in cases followed warnings from scientists, faculty and students on many campuses about the risks of reopening. Now that schools are bringing students back to campus, blaming student behavior for a rise in COVID outbreaks doesn\u2019t square with the way schools have historically approached socializing and its relationship to the experience they\u2019re selling, said Holden Thorp, the former chancellor of the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. Colleges typically celebrate the idea of campus as a gathering place for studying, researching or just chatting on the quad, said Thorp, who also served as the provost at Washington University in St. Louis. In addition, they often let other types of social behavior on campuses go, even when it can have unfortunate consequences, he said. \u201c \u2018It\u2019s very hard to say we\u2019re suspending you for this now, but then next year we\u2019re going to run a picture of a student section at a football game where the students are all celebrating.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Holden Thorp, former chancellor of the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to say we\u2019re suspending you for this now, but then next year we\u2019re going to run a picture of a student section at a football game where the students are all celebrating and say this is why it\u2019s so great to come to our university,\u201d said Thorp, who is now the editor in chief of the Science family of journals. \u201cThat just doesn\u2019t go together.\u201dOfficials decry student partying as selfish, reckless At Syracuse University, J. Michael Haynie, the school\u2019s vice chancellor of strategic initiatives and innovation, called the decision by a group of first-year students to gather on the school\u2019s quad \u201cselfish and unsettling,\u201d in a communication sent this month, and said it could jeopardize \u201cthe very thing that so many of you claim to want from Syracuse University \u2014 that is, a chance at a residential college experience.\u201d In a virtual press conference with local media, Haynie said that he believes that \u201cour students can rise and our students can elevate to the challenge of this novel circumstance.\u201d \u201cWas I disappointed and frustrated by what happened last week?\u201d Haynie said, referring to the gathering on the quad. \u201cAbsolutely yes. Did I communicate my disappointment to the group involved very directly and in no uncertain terms? Yes I did. But does it mean that I have any less confidence today in my belief that the overwhelming majority of Syracuse University students are committed to doing the right thing by their classmates by their professors and by this community? Absolutely no, it does not mean that at all.\u201d In a letter to students this month, Melissa Shivers, Ohio State University\u2019s vice president for student life, warned students to \u201cremember that this is all about more than the individual. We have one shot at this \u2013 responding to what so many of you asked for: an on campus semester at Ohio State,\u201d adding that, \u201cfor some, this is where they find housing safety and food security. Don\u2019t make intentional choices now that inherently challenge the future for so many members of our Buckeye family.\u201d Officials at OSU issued about 225 interim suspensions for off-campus parties and gatherings held between August 19 and August 23, according to Ben Johnson, a spokesman. Roughly 120 of those suspensions were lifted after students were able to show they did not attend or host an unsafe gathering, Johnson wrote in an email. From \u2018cautiously optimistic\u2019 to \u2018it wasn\u2019t going to last\u2019 At Central Michigan University, officials have told students \u201cwe expect you to take responsibility for your actions,\u201d threatening fines and suspensions for students who attend large gatherings, calling student attendance at off campus parties, \u201creckless, irresponsible behavior.\u201d For a while, Jessa Baumdraher was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about the idea of coming back to campus, given that she\u2019s always loved being a CMU student. But once she returned to campus in the fall for classes she realized pretty quickly that \u201cit wasn\u2019t going to last.\u201d She\u2019s been taking her own precautions, like limiting even small gatherings with friends and taking her courses online. Jessa Baumdraher was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about the idea of coming back to campus \u201cIt is up to the students, according to the university, it\u2019s up to all of us,\u201d said Baumdraher, a third-year majoring in political science as well as public and nonprofit administration at CMU. \u201cBut the students are being expected to maintain six feet of distance and have smaller gatherings, which at the collegiate level just really isn\u2019t very realistic.\u201d Heather Smith, a CMU spokesperson, wrote in an email that \u201cthere is certainly shared responsibility to protect the health and safety of our campus community \u2014 being on campus this semester carries new responsibilities for everyone.\u201d The school has been preparing for months to welcome students safely back to campus and so far has approximately 100 positive cases out of 15,000 students, tied mostly to three large houses off campus. In response to those new cases, the school has taken steps, including directing all Greek life organizations to suspend in-person activities and fining and even suspending individuals who host and attend large gatherings, Smith wrote. \u201cTwo weeks into the semester, I can say that most of our students are doing the right thing because they want to ensure we have a successful semester,\u201d she wrote. Though school officials have been in regular communication with students, Baumdraher said she\u2019s concerned that students haven\u2019t felt \u201csafe or informed,\u201d noting that she finds the most up-to-date data on local coronavirus cases by checking a state government website. She feels the best plan for this fall would have been to offer courses largely remotely with the exception of classes that needed to be in-person \u2014 like labs or performance \u2014 and are required for students\u2019 majors. University leaders are weighing financial, political concerns A variety of factors figured into whether colleges decided to bring students back to campus this fall. Finances were certainly key, as colleges whose business models were already strained, found themselves squeezed even further by the pandemic, making it difficult to risk forgoing revenue by offering another remote-only semester. But politics also likely also played a role, Thorp said. At public colleges, officials are often working within systems that are politically governed, he noted. Private schools typically have boards of trustees filled with members who are successful in the private sector and \u201cthose folks have their own views on all of this,\u201d Thorp said. \u201cSince unfortunately the pandemic and our response to it is a political issue, you can\u2019t ignore the political overlay that\u2019s on this whole thing,\u201d he said. In the South and the Midwest, schools have invited students back, in part because \u201cthere is this political pressure to open colleges and universities, in my view, prematurely,\u201d he added. Our political and cultural attitudes are also limiting the tools available to university officials to influence students\u2019 behavior, said Brent Roberts, the director of the Center for Social and Behavioral Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Social science research indicates that the college student age group is not \u201cperfectly well-suited to this enterprise,\u201d of strictly following rules set forth by officials, Roberts said. That means, \u201cwe should do everything we can to make this situation easier on them,\u201d he added. Many colleges have worked to design a system that will minimize the role of students\u2019 behavior in protecting the campus from COVID. Some, for example, are requiring that all large lecture courses be held online, Roberts said. But colleges can\u2019t do much about students\u2019 behavior off-campus. The idea of shutting down Greek life or bars for the semester is anathema to the sense of autonomy and individuality that Americans hold so dear, he said. And preventing the spread of a pandemic likely requires a collective response that would infringe on that sense of autonomy. Colleges may face obstacles to closing these kinds of gathering places, but what they can do is take advantage of the research available at their own institutions to better steer students\u2019 behavior. \u201cWe\u2019re publishing these papers, we know what happens \u2014 use the information to your benefit so you can actually design a program that\u2019s better,\u201d he said. \u201cGoing at it by just punishing students is obviously a very simple violation of what we know about trying to shape behavior. You should at least have a package of rewards and punishments.\u201d More broadly, institutions\u2019 and governing boards\u2019 policies have created the environment in which students are making their individual choices, said Louise Seamster, an assistant professor of sociology and criminology at the University of Iowa. In one of her courses, she spends the entire semester teaching students how to analyze policies at the individual, organizational and institutional level \u2014 for example, asking them to evaluate the role of pharmaceutical companies in opioid addiction, which is often portrayed as a personal choice. Colleges\u2019 approach to COVID offers a \u201cperfect example\u201d that she can use this semester to help her students understand these concepts, Seamster said. Often we focus on individuals\u2019 choices, like the decision whether to attend a party, and individual outcomes, like whether you contract COVID or face a punishment. \u201cBut people\u2019s behavior is coordinated through organizations, like universities,\u201d Seamster said, and \u201cuniversity behavior is coordinated by institutional policies.\u201d \u201cWe have had a failure at the institutional and organizational level at most universities, with a few notable exceptions,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s left now is students being blamed.\u201d"}]}
