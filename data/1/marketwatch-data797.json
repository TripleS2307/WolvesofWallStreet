The Tesla Model S and Model 3 compared", "body": "Tesla Model S sedan is the car that put Tesla TSLA, +1.89% on the map, and the Model 3 is the vehicle designed to put the company onto the shopping lists of mainstream car buyers. So, we\u2019re going to look at how these two EVs compare when pitted directly against each other. Is the larger and pricier Model S still the standard-bearer for the Tesla brand? Or does the smaller and less-expensive Model 3 make a bigger and better first impression for potential electric car owners? Let\u2019s break things down into five simple categories: Price This should be an easy win for the Model 3, since the compact sedan has a starting price that\u2019s considerably lower than the larger Model S. Check Tesla\u2019s official website and you\u2019ll see the Model 3 starts at $37,990, while the Model S costs a whopping $74,990 for the least expensive variant. Choose the Model S in Performance trim with the optional $8,000 Autopilot package and you\u2019re looking at a starting price that breaks the $100,000 barrier. The Tesla Model 3. iStock The problem for Tesla was when it came to starting production of the entry-level Model 3. For many months, priority was initially given to building the more expensive versions, fitted with a bigger battery pack and all-wheel drive. Start loading options onto a Model 3 and, surprise, the price gap between it and its bigger brother, the Model S, narrows considerably.

Add AutoPilot and you\u2019re looking at a Model 3 that\u2019s close to $62,990. But credit to Tesla, the standard Model 3 is finally online, according to the Tesla website, if you ordered a Standard version now, delivery would take between 6-8 weeks. As a bonus, no matter which Tesla you choose, you have seven days or 1,000 miles to return the car for a full refund. Considering the entire Model 3 line is finally available, the (belated but deserved) win here goes to Tesla\u2019s entry-level sedan. Winner: Model 3Power If you think electric cars have anything to do with golf-carts, then get behind the wheel of a Tesla. These sedans are fast, no matter if you\u2019re going for a Model 3 or Model S. You\u2019ve probably read about the optional Ludicrous mode that\u2019s available in the Model S, which gives it supercar-like acceleration. Punch the gas pedal and the sprint from 0-60 mph takes only 2.4 seconds, according to Tesla. That\u2019s crazy fast and about equal to the acceleration provided in the multimillion-dollar Bugatti Chiron. A Model 3 in Performance trim is no slouch, however. The same 0-60 run is accomplished in 3.2 seconds and, ironically, it\u2019s the Model 3 that has a slightly higher top speed (162 mph, versus 155 mph in the Model S). But if you\u2019re a speed freak and want the ultimate in near-silent and scary-fast acceleration, the obvious winner is the Model S. Winner: Model S You might like: What it\u2019s like to drive a Tesla Model YRange For many people considering an electric car, this is the single most important factor. What good is an EV if it can\u2019t get you where you need to go, and then back again. When it comes to range, Model 3 offers a wider overall spread. The standard model goes 250 miles, while the Performance clocks in at 299 miles\u2019 range. The Long Range model boasts 322 miles between charges. The Model S Performance boasts a range of 348 miles and the Long Range variant can go 402 miles. Winner: Model SSpace The bigger car is going to provide more interior room, right? You\u2019ll be surprised to learn the Model 3 offers cabin room that\u2019s almost identical to what you get in the larger Model S. In fact, the Model 3 offers slightly more front and rear headroom than the longer and sleeker Model 3. When it comes to front and rear legroom, the two are as close as you can get. Each delivers 42.7 inches of front legroom, with the Model S holding the slightest advantage in rear legroom at 35.4, versus 35.2 in the Model 3. It\u2019s only in hip room and shoulder room where the Model S begins to, ahem, stretch out from its smaller sibling. Also see: These 3 EVs are the lowest cost to own over 5 years In terms of cargo space, the Model S streaks ahead with more than 26 cubic feet of trunk space, opposed to about 15 cubic feet in the Model 3. Credit the larger sedan\u2019s convenient rear hatchback, which opens wide and makes cargo-toting a painless process. There is also the option of two rear-facing jump seats available in the Model S, though these are only suitable for small (and brave) young children. Cabin space is close, but cargo room is a clear win for the bigger car. Winner: Model SNew vs. used: Let\u2019s stir up a little drama by adding a wild card option, a used Model S compared with a brand-new Model 3. We looked at what an average price would be for a 2012 Model S, the sedan\u2019s first year of production. Basing our search in South California and assuming the car has about 55,000 miles, a Fair Market Range according to KBB.com would place the Model S price between $29,000 to $33,000. That\u2019s at least several thousand dollars less than the least expensive Model 3 though admittedly, you have an 8-year-old EV and not a brand-new edition. Still, it\u2019s food for thought if you love the idea of going electric with plenty of power and luxury along for the ride. Read: How to test drive a used car Even though it comes up a bit short on range, Model 3\u2019s similar cabin space to the Model S along with performance that\u2019s still jaw-dropping fast are factors that cannot be overlooked. In the end, with the price being a huge factor for most shoppers, it\u2019s the less expensive Model 3 that\u2019s the better EV.
