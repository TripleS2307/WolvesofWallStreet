In a new policy framework, agreed to by all 17 top Fed officials, the central bank said it would allow inflation to run above 2% for some period of time. This is known as an \u201caverage inflation target.\u201d \u201cThe Committee seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2% over time and therefore judges that, following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2%, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2% for some time,\u201d the new policy framework said. The Fed also removed its bias against strong labor markets. Read:Here are major changes to Fed strategy The announcement of the new strategy was timed for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s speech to the annual Jackson Hole economic symposium, to be held virtually this year. Fed chairman have used the conference to make major policy announcements in the past. Some Fed watchers were surprised that the strategy was announced as it looked like the Fed needed to more work on the plan, given how little it was mentioned in the minutes of the central banks late July meeting. In his speech, Powell trumpeted the changes, saying \u201ca robust job market can be sustained without causing an outbreak in inflation.\u201d Economic evidence shows that minority communities benefit the most when strong labor markets persist. Support for strong labor markets would not have come from a central banker a generation ago. In the past, strong labor markets for Fed officials meant that higher inflation was just around the corner and a reason to \u201ctap the brakes\u201d and raise interest rates - even if there was no sign of higher prices. Powell did not elaborate on what \u201cmoderately above 2%\u201d means. Later on Thursday Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said it meant inflation in a range of a 2.25% to 2.5% annual rate. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said the details needed to be avoided to achieve consensus. \u201cThis is a very large committee as you know, with many opinions,\u201d Bullard said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think you want to get into precise mathematical formulas here. But the spirit of this is that, in the committee\u2019s judgement, it would be wise to allow inflation to be above targets for some time to make up for past misses.\u201d Over the past twenty years, people globally have started to save more and companies have started to invest less. This has pushed down interest rates around the world, forcing central banks to rewrite their strategies. Investors have started to bet that inflation is going to remain below central bank targets. This is a danger for economies because too low inflation can sap the life out of an economy. Foreign central banks tried to reverse low inflation expectations by pushing their benchmark interest rates into negative territory to spur demand. But this looks a lot like ineffective policy, or \u201cpushing on a string\u201d.\u201d The Fed wants to avoid falling into this morass. \u201cWe have seen this adverse dynamic play out in other major economies around the world and have learned that once it sets in, it can be very difficult to overcome. We want to do what we can to prevent such a dynamic from happening here,\u201d Powell said. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.777% rose after Powell\u2019s remarks. Stocks were higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% was up 260 points in late afternoon trading. Asked about the economic outlook, Powell said he expected the recovery begun in May and June to continue \u201cwith stops and starts\u201d but that unemployment would stay elevated. In some sense, the new strategy is an academic exercise. Adam Posen, the president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said he was doubtful that inflation overshoots its 2% target \u201canytime soon\u201d or even over the next few years. Vincent Reinhart, a former Fed staffer and now chief economist at BNY Mellon Asset Management, noted the Fed strategy did not discuss what would happen if inflation was over the Fed\u2019s target for a long period of time. It is difficult to image the Fed would engineer softer economic conditions to bring inflation below its 2% target, he said. Jim O\u2019Sullivan, the chief U.S. macro strategist at TD Securities, said the new wording amounts to a more dovish reaction function for the Fed. This dovish tilt \u201cwas already evident in actions and speeches,\u201d he noted."}]}
