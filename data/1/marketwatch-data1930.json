So what happens now?", "body": "The tech industry worked for years to build a world in which everyone worked remotely, tied together by services and computer power delivered through the cloud. When the COVID-19 pandemic suddenly created that world, tech was ready. Zoom Video Communications Inc. ZM scaled from hosting about 10 million meeting participants a day to 300 million, adding online happy hours and Taco Tuesday streams with grandparents to the business meetings for which it was known before the pandemic. Netflix Inc. NFLX, +1.43% added more than 25 million customers in a few months, and pushed out fresh content like \u201cTiger King\u201d to keep customers entertained while they were stuck at home. Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +3.01% leveraged a giant infrastructure network it had spent years building to ship needed goods to customers\u2019 homes and offer companies cloud-computing power necessary to scale their own services. Even as their own employees dealt with extreme conditions and users pushed the boundaries of their internet connections, tech companies were able to keep their services up and running and service a nation that needed them more than ever. \u201cWe went from a country that did business one way and basically overnight flipped a switch to do it another way, and we had the infrastructure to make that transition without a lot of breakage because of the vision of some really impressive people and companies,\u201d said Brendan Connaughton, the founder and managing partner of Catalyst Private Wealth in San Francisco. Tech companies have been richly rewarded for those efforts by investors, who have pushed the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.39% to record highs in hopes of finding something resembling safety in insecure economic times. Zoom\u2019s valuation has more than tripled in 2020 to top $70 billion, while Netflix and Amazon gained more than 60%, putting Amazon back atop a $1 trillion market cap. The question for investors and the tech industry is what happens next: Can tech companies continue to show the type of earnings and usage growth that would justify those valuations as the pandemic continues, or was it just a surge of demand that would have arrived later? Netflix kicked off tech\u2019s earnings season Thursday and may have given a preview of what\u2019s in store: After Netflix executives admitted that huge growth in the first half of the year likely means a slowdown in the second half, and that original content scheduled for early next year will likely be delayed due to production shutdowns, shares plunged and wiped out $15 billion of the company\u2019s valuation in a single trading session Friday. Full earnings season preview: Profit set to plunge as the coronavirus batters all sectors MarketWatch recently spoke with four experts \u2014 an independent investment analyst and sell-side financial analyst focused on tech, a financial adviser to high-net-worth individuals and an independent tech analyst \u2014 for insight into where the tech industry could be headed as COVID-19 wreaks havoc in the U.S. Here is what they expect moving forward.Strong second-quarter results expected Early indications suggest that tech companies did well in the second quarter, after first-quarter results for most companies contained only a couple of weeks of the shelter-in-place orders. IDC and Gartner reported a very strong quarter for personal-computer shipments, as PC manufacturers refilled retail pipelines that were drained by the initial rush to purchase laptops for at-home workers. Software companies are expected to show results of businesses looking for ways to keep employees connected and operating. \u201cThis coming quarter is going to be a \u2018bright light\u2019 quarter for a lot of companies,\u201d predicted Maribel Lopez, founder and principal analyst of Lopez Research. And a lack of big earnings or revenue growth may not even matter at this point in the cycle, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said. \u201cWhen you have a once-in-a-hundred-years pandemic, investors are basically writing off earnings unless they\u2019re dramatically different one way or the other that changes the fundamental story for the long term,\u201d Ives said. \u201cUnless there\u2019s a silver-bullet business market trajectory change that changes the long-term focus right now, the haters could hate but the path for tech continues to be up and to the right through and after this earnings season.\u201d That is especially true for companies dedicated to the cloud, which has proved to be a saving grace in the pandemic. All the analysts noted that many investors who have jumped into cloud-related stocks are likely in it for the long haul and expecting even more gains. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna see cloud become something that is unfathomable,\u201d said Beth Kindig, an investment analyst with a paid newsletter who sometimes writes for MarketWatch on tech stocks. Kindig: \u2018Moats\u2019 will make all the difference for cloud companies Currently, analysts expect sales in the S&P 500\u2019s SPX, +0.87% information-technology sector XLK, +1.52% are expected to decline about 0.6% year-over-year while earnings are expected to drop 9.2%\u2013behind only the health care XLV, +0.90%, financials XLF, +0.11% and utilities sectors XLU, -0.01% in both respects. Catalyst Private Wealth\u2019s Connaughton \u2014 who advises many Bay Area tech executives on financial issues \u2014 said performance would be even better if some big tech names, including Amazon, weren\u2019t moved out of the tech sector in recent years. \u201cTechnology will probably surprise on the upside, consumer-connected sectors will probably surprise on the downside,\u201d Connaughton predicted.Third quarter may be a different story Lopez, who advises tech companies, suggested that the big spending spree of the first and second quarters may not continue in the summer as companies pause spending to assess. In her telling, companies spent fast and furious at the end of the first quarter and through the second quarter to find a stasis point, and now are going to take time to fashion a long-term plan that will lead to spending in the fourth quarter and into 2021. \u201cThe first wave of business demand we have gone through,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cThe second wave will start when [executives] officially\u2026figure out what their at-work populace is going to look like\u2026and give employees a full work-from-home package.\u201d Read also: An obscure court ruling could play havoc with tech companies\u2019 earnings That scenario in the enterprise space could play out for consumers as well. Those who still have a job have settled into their new routine and made the tech and subscription purchases they need to get by in the near term, and the typical impetus for spending in the quarter \u2014 back-to-school spending \u2014 may not happen if kids wind up staying home for remote learning. Also, tech gadgets like smartphones are a big question mark, as consumers could see other purchases \u2014 including PCs \u2014 being more useful as they stay at home. That dynamic is going to make forecasting third-quarter results difficult. \u201cRight now, guidance for the third quarter is playing a game of blindfolded darts,\u201d Ives said. Executives are likely to punt instead of offer hard numbers, as most did in the second quarter, when exact guidance figures were few and far between. Instead, Connaughton expects to hear more specific plans from officials for where they expect to spend money in the future, and what that communicates about the future. That information will guide investment decisions throughout the quarter and the rest of the year as investors determine the best long-term plays, he said. \u201cThis earnings season is almost a reset, we all have to go back to the beginning, to an understanding of how their business is going to change.\u201dBack to winners and losers With that dynamic, it is likely that the broad-based gains in tech stocks that happened in the second quarter is likely to go away, and some of the boats that rose along with the tide could start sinking lower. \u201cRight now every boat has come off the bottom, [but] to go to the next level you actually have to outperform,\u201d Connaughton said. Investors are likely to focus on the segments within tech that will continue to show solid growth no matter how long the pandemic lasts, and potentially move away from legacy hardware companies especially. \u201cHPE HPE, -1.80%, IBM IBM, -2.81%, Cisco CSCO, +0.15%, ultimately they\u2019re on the wrong side of the spending trends,\u201d Ives said. \u201cThe COVID-19 environment accelerated cloud, cybersecurity, streaming, e-commerce \u2014 that benefits only a handful of public companies,\u201d Ives said. Kindig pointed out that any company basing results on the online-advertising market could be high-risk due to the uncertainty of that market in the short term, as well as the volatility that appears inherent to the ad-tech industry. Also, she pointed to content-delivery networks such as Akamai Technologies Inc. AKAM, +1.30%, Fastly Inc. FSLY, +9.38% and Cloudflare Inc. NET, +6.77% \u2014 which help to handle the increased volume of internet traffic \u2014 as \u201cthe one coronavirus trade that I feel fairly confident is temporary.\u201d All four experts with whom MarketWatch spoke pointed to the semiconductor sector as one of the most important and interesting to watch in this earnings season, after a quarter in which Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.54% passed chip behemoth Intel Corp. INTC, -1.03% in market cap as Intel takes hits from rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, -3.94% Connaughton said his research showed a strong lead correlation to the entire market through the semiconductor sector. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking that the semiconductor companies have really turned into\u2026an early-cycle indicator,\u201d he said, comparing them to the way transportation stocks were once seen as a harbinger of market moves. \u201cIf you can get the semis right, you\u2019re gonna get the market call right about 70% of the time.\u201dThe big guys are going to be just fine Another nearly unanimous opinion was that Big Tech should be a popular destination for investment, especially Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +2.48% and Amazon. Questions about smartphone demand makes Apple a little more questionable, and ad demand at Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, +1.82% GOOG, +1.97% and Facebook Inc. FB, +0.26% are worrisome, but the companies\u2019 dominant positions in different tech marketplaces are expected to buttress them. \u201cWe think FAANG names go 20-30% higher over the next two months,\u201d Ives said. Those companies aren\u2019t just dominant when it comes to consumers, though. Lopez pointed out that many of the chip and hardware companies that sell large tech equipment are just as reliant \u2014 if not moreso \u2014 on Big Tech as consumers for their cloud-computing build out. There are only a few so-called hyperscalers that create demand for components such as servers, storage and expensive chips, and their purchasing whims could determine the path of the tech ecosystem in the coming months. \u201cA lot of the money in enterprise has shifted to those who build cloud, they control the industry now,\u201d she said. And if the other companies don\u2019t live up to what big cloud providers like Amazon, Microsoft and Google need, they may just leave them in the dust. \u201cIf they don\u2019t see things moving fast enough with the product guys, they\u2019ll do it themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cThe balance of power has shifted, especially in the last six months.\u201d Those dynamics are expected to show up in these results and third-quarter results later in the year, which will show up in the stock market. \u201cThere are good management teams and bad management teams, companies that are executing well and executing poorly, and their financial results will start to represent the good management and the bad management,\u201d Connaughton said. \u201cIt will get us back to normalcy.\u201d"}]}
