What happened: Inventories of durable goods, such as autos and lumber, increased by 0.6%. Stockpiles of nondurable goods were unchanged, however, largely because of a decline in the production of grocery staples and clothing. The inventory-to-sales ratio slipped to 1.31 from 1.32 in the prior month and is back to precrisis levels. The ratio soared early in the pandemic as sales nosedived and firms got stuck with an excess of goods. Yet the ratio has declined as the economy recovered and sales picked up. The approaching holidays also is encouraging firms to produce more goods . Big picture: The increase in production is a good sign for an economy still struggling to get back to normal amid an ongoing pandemic, but the recent rise in viral cases could be another roadblock. Some states are putting in place new restrictions to try to forestall another major outbreak. Market reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% and S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% rose in Friday trades."}]}
