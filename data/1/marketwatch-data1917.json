This means that the U.S. will receive 100% of Gilead's total remdesivir production in July and 90% in August and September, a decision that has prompted criticism in Europe and the U.K. Gilead in May received an emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration for remdesivir as a treatment for some severely ill, hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Gilead announced pricing for remdesivir earlier on Monday; the drug will cost $2,340 for a 5-day course of treatment in developed countries, with one exception. The cost of treatment for people who have commercial health insurance is $3,120. The Department of Health and Human Services said in a news release that AmerisourceBergen Corp. ABC, -1.65% will continue to ship the drug. Following the EUA in early May, Gilead had donated more than 100,000 doses of remdesivir to the U.S. government, which then dispensed the drug to hospitals."}]}
