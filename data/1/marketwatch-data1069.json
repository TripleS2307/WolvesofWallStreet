The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that total household debt fell by $34 billion, or 0.2%, in the second quarter. It was the largest decrease on record since the second quarter of 2013. The drop in household debt doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean Americans are better off financially though. A separate survey from real-estate website Apartment List found that one in three people couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pay their rent or mortgage in full this month. Indeed, the downturn in debt is actually a reflection of people cutting their spending more than it is a sign that people are paying off loans. The main driver behind the decrease was a $76 billion decline in credit card balances, which represents the largest decline since at least 2000. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs spending rebounds, so will outstanding debt figures,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. But some argued that growth in household debt may be stymied by lenders who are wary of taking on more risk amid a pandemic. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGrowth in consumer credit is likely to remain subdued because lenders are tightening standards on new lending and some are cutting back on credit limits and closing accounts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Tendayi Kapfidze, chief economist at LendingTree TREE, -0.37%. Many mortgage lenders, for instance, are requiring applicants to have higher credit scores to qualify for loans compared with before COVID-19. Meanwhile, the wide-scale availability of forbearance on debts, ranging from mortgages to student loans, contributed to a decline in delinquency rates. Delinquencies for mortgages, auto loans and credit cards were all down. In the student loan sector, approximately 88% of borrowers had a scheduled payment of $0, the New York Fed found. \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098Lenders are tightening standards on new lending and some are cutting back on credit limits and closing accounts.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Tendayi Kapfidze, chief economist at LendingTree \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith forbearances having been rolled out nearly universally, not surprisingly, the repayment rates of student loans have declined sharply,\u00e2\u0080\u009d New York Fed researchers wrote in a blog post about the quarterly debt report. It could be a long time before the economic downturn caused by the pandemic translates into upticks in loan defaults and foreclosures, experts say. In the case of mortgages, Americans can get up to 12 months\u00e2\u0080\u0099 worth of payment relief if they have a federally-backed loan, including those backed by Fannie Mae FNMA, +0.73% \u00c2 and Freddie Mac FMCC, +0.52% \u00c2 . As a result, pandemic-related defaults on home loans may not appear in earnest until the second half of 2021. Americans who were laid off or furloughed may not be receiving boosted unemployment payments at the moment, which could make settling debts more challenging in the interim. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve lost your income due to the pandemic, you may have to put other financial priorities first, like keeping a roof over your head and food on the table, said Sara Rathner, credit card expert at NerdWallet. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s OK to focus on that now and deal with debts later.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rathner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advice: First, build a rainy-day fund to cover emergencies. Then, pay off debt by meeting all minimum payments and putting any extra money toward the loans with the highest interest rates. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis can help you stay organized and motivated while ultimately saving you on interest,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said."}]}
