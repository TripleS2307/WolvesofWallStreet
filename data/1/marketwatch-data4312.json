The players posted a statement and list of demands on The Players\u2019 Tribune website and social media with the hashtag #WeAreUnited and sent out a news release to reporters. The release listed the names of 13 Pac-12 players from 10 schools, including Oregon star safety Jevon Holland, and provided a statement from each one. Arizona State offensive lineman Cody Shear told The Associated Press the players began connecting about a month ago and have been communicating through the text messaging app GroupMe. He said the number of players in the group has grown to more than 400, though it\u2019s impossible to gauge everyone\u2019s level of commitment. \u201cWe can\u2019t control that,\u201d said Shear, a junior from Eugene, Oregon, who transferred from the Ducks to ASU this year. \u201cTo have that many players, we have a pretty good idea there\u2019s a lot of kids and college athletes in this conference that agree with some if not all that we\u2019re asking as far as the player demands. I can\u2019t give you a number, but there\u2019s an abundance of players that are messaging in that GroupMe consistently. It feels like the phone\u2019s blowing up every second.\u201d The public demands from the Pac-12 players follow a surge in athlete empowerment across college football. Players have called out coaches at Iowa, Oklahoma State and Florida State. Players have led demonstrations, marches and rallies on campuses all over the country to protest racial injustice and police brutality in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd. Now, as college sports leaders work to salvage a football season being threatened by the pandemic, more players are demanding to be heard. \u201cWe believe a football season under these conditions would be reckless and put us at needless risk,\u201d the players said in their news release. \u201cWe will not play until there is real change that is acceptable to us.\u201d The Pac-12 on Friday released a revised football schedule for the coming season. Officials across college football anticipate disruptions related to COVID-19. The Atlantic Coast Conference and Southeastern Conference also announced plans last week for truncated seasons. The NCAA has released guidelines for COVID-19 testing and other health and safety protocols to be used by schools, and Power Five conferences \u2014 the Pac-12, Big Ten, Big 12, ACC and SEC \u2014 are finalizing their own similar recommendations. The Pac-12 also announced Friday that 20 hours per week of mandatory team activities for football, including weight training, meetings and unpadded walk-through practices, will be permitted to begin Monday. Preseason football practice for Pac-12 schools is set to begin Aug. 17. The states of Arizona and California, home to half the Pac-12 schools, have been hit by some of the most severe surges in COVID-19 cases over the last month. California-Berkeley has announced the fall semester will begin with all classes being taught online. USC said most of its classes will be online for the coming semester. \u201cSince the system is willing to risk our health and safety in the midst of the global pandemic, we must look out for each other,\u201d Oregon State defensive back Jaydon Grant said in a statement. Pac-12 spokesman Andrew Walker directed requests for comment from the conference to a statement released Saturday. \u201cNeither the Conference nor our university athletics departments have been contacted by this group regarding these topics,\u201d the Pac-12 said. \u201cWe support our student-athletes using their voices, and have regular communications with our student-athletes at many different levels on a range of topics.\u201d The players\u2019 list of demands addresses healthy and safety protections related to COVID-19; protection for all college sports programs from being eliminated by budget cuts; racial injustice in college sports; and economic rights and compensation for college athletes. \u201cThis is important to me because I want to see the young men that are being exploited by the PAC12 & NCAA have the right to earn money for their families,\u201d Holland said in his statement. \u201cI want the safety of my peers lives to be placed higher than the sport they play. If we are treated like employees then we should be compensated as such.\u201d Among the specifics are: \u2014 Player-approved health and safety standards enforced by a third party selected by players to address COVID-19 and serious injury, abuse and death. \u2014 50% of a sport\u2019s revenue distributed evenly to athletes. \u2014 Medical insurance for six years after college. \u2014 Reduced pay of Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott, coaches, administrators. \u2014 2% of revenue to support financial aid for low-income Black students and community initiatives. The other players listed were: Treyjohn Butler of Stanford; Jake Curhan, Joshua Drayden and Valentino Daltoso of California; Nick Ford of Utah; Elisha Guidry of UCLA; Malik Hausman of Arizona; Dallas Hobbs of Washington State; and Ty Jones and Joe Tryon of Washington. Oregon offensive lineman Penei Sewell, who is projected to be one of the first players selected in the next NFL draft, was among the college players who showed support for the movement on social media. The group said it was committed to forming alliances with athletes from other conferences and that some players from outside the Pac-12 acknowledged the movement. \u201c#WeAreUnited in our commitment to secure fair treatment for college athletes,\u201d it said. \u201cDue to COVID-19 and other serious concerns, we will opt out of Pac-12 fall camp and game participation unless the following demands are guaranteed in writing by our conference to protect and benefit both scholarship athletes and walk-ons.\u201d"}]}
