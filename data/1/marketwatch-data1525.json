Then, one of his followers asked him what a typical earnings night is like. He responded with a thread that explained the process that Wall Street sell-side analysts go through on a typical earnings afternoon, which typically stretches long into the night or early morning, sometimes as late \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or early \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as 4 a.m. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought maybe there is a way for me to be a little bit more interesting without running afoul of the [Bernstein] social-media policy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. That first Twitter thread received a positive reaction from clients and input from within his firm, where he recently led a session for junior analysts on \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow to Succeed on the Sell Side,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which was based on one of his threads. He will also be conducting a session at Bernstein\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009csummer school.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Since last month, when he answered that initial question, Rasgon has written threads on other topics of interest to investors \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and financial reporters \u00e2\u0080\u0094 discussing everything from earnings conference calls, to how to interact with clients (the buy side/fund managers), to how to deal with the media, to the art of writing titles for research reports, to how he got his job on Wall Street. Rasgon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s path to Wall Street was not a standard route. He said that most analysts start out at a firm, eventually become junior or associate analysts, and move up to the job of senior analyst. Rasgon, though, joined Bernstein Research from McKinsey & Co., where he had been a consultant focusing on semiconductor companies, his first job after earning a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in chemical engineering. During two graduate-school summers, Rasgon had worked at IBM Corp.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s IBM, -2.81% Watson Research Center, where he was a co-op engineer working on advanced lithography and processes used in the manufacturing of semiconductors. Rasgon joined Bernstein in April 2008, during the financial crisis and just after Bear Stearns failed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I began, I had no experience on Wall Street, I did not know the difference between the buy side and the sell side,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI knew operationally what made a good semiconductor company, but I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how to talk to clients or the sales force. No one understood anything I was talking about.\u00e2\u0080\u009d There would be mistakes along the way. One amusing thread that journalists such as yours truly found fascinating featured a story about the so-called callbacks that companies make to individual sell-side analysts after their public earnings calls. The callback gives companies an opportunity to stress certain points to analysts, as well as \u00e2\u0080\u009cengage in damage control\u00e2\u0080\u009d if \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey put their foot in their mouth on the call,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which, Rasgon noted parenthetically, \u00e2\u0080\u009chappens.\u00e2\u0080\u009d iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } In this particular case, Rasgon said that some companies try to get analysts to give them information about their financial models or their estimates, so they can properly guide them in the right direction. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSuffice it to say, on my very first earnings season I was unfamiliar with the concept of \u00e2\u0080\u0098the callback,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u009d Rasgon wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI knew I had some sort of phone call with IR scheduled afterwards, but didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really understand what it was for.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rasgon said the investor-relations executive called from one company, and, after going over a bunch of data, bluntly asked him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your number?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rasgon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial models are rather complex, and when he said he had not even begun to work on his model yet the IR person went silent, then said thanks and hung up \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Rasgon later recognized that the company had been trying to steer his model. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis particular company was on the aggressive side,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rasgon added in his Twitter thread. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat level of \u00e2\u0080\u0098help\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is not typical in my experience.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added that some companies will not say anything beyond their public conference call or earnings script. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere has to be a happy medium,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Some of what Rasgon does is akin to financial journalism: trying to write a headline that grabs attention, and then telling a story that investors \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t all understand the minutiae of the semiconductor industry \u00e2\u0080\u0094 can understand. He said he spends a great deal of time trying to think of a title for his company reports, and, of course, on the content within them. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAbout one out of every five of my titles [gets] rejected,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. He also noted that any titles with a hint of a gambling reference get immediately rejected by Bernstein\u00e2\u0080\u0099s compliance department. Some catchy Rasgon headlines that were published include \u00e2\u0080\u009cEvel Knievel Lives?\u00e2\u0080\u009d which described a forecast for 2019 by Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, -3.94% \u00c2 that called for a \u00e2\u0080\u009cback-half ramp [in revenue] that would make Evel Knievel nervous.\u00e2\u0080\u009d AMD actually did go on to report a huge quarter, but data-center sales came in below expectations. An amusing one during Qualcomm Inc.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s QCOM, +2.06% legal saga with Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.74% \u00c2 compared the murky situation in its communications chips to the jibberish-speaking and famously hirsute Cousin Itt of Addams Family fame, in a note called, \u00e2\u0080\u009cQualcomm FQ1 2020 Recap \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Cousin Itt?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is enough hair to keep us sidelined,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote. After Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.54% \u00c2 CEO Jensen Huang, in a COVID-19\u00e2\u0080\u0093era product launch via video, opened the oven in his home kitchen to unveil a slew of new products, Rasgon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s headline was simply, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCooking with Jensen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2 Rasgon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enthusiasm for his work and his enthusiasm for the wonky world of semiconductors are contagious, even in our brief conversation. And now he has found a way to meld that passion with a facility for writing to draw clients \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the press \u00e2\u0080\u0094 into his complex research via Twitter TWTR, -0.23%. It seems to be working. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fun job,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can write about whatever interests me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But the most important element of the work is clients, and he has learned to put them first, he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like people and cannot succeed in building relationships you will fail on the sell side, no matter how good your stock picks are.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}]}
