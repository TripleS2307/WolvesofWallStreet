Rising tensions between Beijing and Washington also were in focus, after the Trump administration ordered a ban on transactions with a pair of China-based technology companies. How did equity benchmarks trade? The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% closed 46.50 points, or 0.2%, higher at 27,433.48, after flipping positive in the final hour of trade. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% eked out a gain of 2.12 points, or 0.1%, to close at 3,351.28. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.39% retreated 97.09 points, or 0.9%, ending at 11,010.98, after trading down more than 1.5%. The Russell 2000 Index RUT, +0.55% of small-capitalization stocks outperformed, adding 24.56 points, or 1.6%, ending at 1,569.18. For the week, the Dow gained 3.8%, its biggest percent gain since June 5. The S&P 500 rose 2.5% for its biggest weekly percent climb since July 2; while the Nasdaq climbed 2.5%. What drove the market U.S. stocks rallied in the last minutes of trade Friday, despite Washington\u2019s failure to come up with a deal on a fiscal stimulus package before Congress breaks for summer recess. While investors remain hopeful that America\u2019s economy eventually will receive another shot in the arm in the form of government spending, they also worry that last month\u2019s job gains, reported by the Labor Department on Friday, might cause Congress to drag its feet. The U.S. added 1.76 million jobs in July \u2014 just one-third of the unexpected 4.8 million gain last month \u2014 with the unemployment rate falling to 10.2% from 11.1% in June. Consensus estimates from economists polled by MarketWatch had been for an increase of 1.7 million jobs on the month. \u201cThe biggest impact of the July employment numbers are political,\u201d Steven Blitz, chief U.S. economist at TS Lombard, wrote following Friday\u2019s employment report. \u201cAs a sense of emergency diminishes, so too the rush to push the package across the finish line.\u201d While the jobs report was better than expected, many U.S. states remain in a battle with rising coronavirus infection rates, while millions of workers still rely on unemployment benefits to stay afloat in a crippled economy. \u201cThe economy is still on life support,\u201d James Knightley, ING\u2019s chief international economist told MarketWatch. \u201cIf this drags on,\u201d he said of pandemic aid talks, \u201cI think we\u2019re in a more challenging period for economic growth.\u201d Read: Next coronavirus aid package probably won\u2019t become reality this month after better-than-expected July jobs report, analyst says House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democratic leaders met Friday afternoon with White House negotiators for more than a hour in a last-ditch effort to produce an estimated trillion dollar-plus coronavirus aid package before talks collapsed. As of Friday, the global tally for confirmed cases of COVID-19 climbed above 19 million, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University, and the death toll rose to 715,163. The U.S. case tally climbed to 4.9 million and the death toll rose above 160,000, after the U.S. added another 1,000 deaths overnight and counted another 57,000 new cases. Out-of-work Americans already saw an extra $600 a week unemployment relief benefit expire last month, a development that when combined with recent, worrisome economic data could stymie a quick economic recovery that Wall Street has been betting on. \u201cThe stock market is counting on a deal,\u201d said Kevin Barry, chief investment officer at Captrust, in an interview. \u201cAnd every once in a while when it doesn\u2019t get what it wants, it throws a tired, toddler tantrum, bringing down the market 3%-10%,\u201d he warned. But Barry also thinks that for elected officials, \u201cthe stock market is not the priority. The election is the priority,\u201d he said. \u201cOne thing that could prompt a deal, could be a poll change,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth sides want to cushion the consumer to increase their election chances.\u201d On Thursday, President Donald Trump told reporters that he could sign an executive order to provide fresh aid to the jobless, but presidential powers may be limited as to what if any action can be taken to provide fresh funds without Congressional approval. However, Trump did sign an executive order late Thursday that bars transactions with the parent companies of Chinese social media companies TikTok and Tencent TCEHY, +1.98%, as the president attempts to force an acquisition of TikTok\u2019s U.S. arm in the coming 45 days. In response, TikTok, which is owned by China-based ByteDance, has threatened to sue the president, reflecting rising Sino-American tensions. \u201cFrankly, the big story is the election,\u201d Barry said. \u201cWhy we are doing a China app announcement now, instead of 90 days ago, is because we are in the teeth of the election.\u201d See: Trump\u2019s TikTok and WeChat ban hurts Chinese internet stocks \u2014 here\u2019s why his executive order also puts pressure on MicrosoftWhich stocks were in focus?
