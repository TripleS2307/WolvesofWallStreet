The U.S. added 4.8 million jobs in June and the unemployment rate fell for the second straight month to 11.1%, according to government data released Thursday. \u201cA strong U.S. nonfarm payroll report suggests the U.S. economic rebound continues and that crude demand should follow suit,\u201d said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, in a market update.

Analysts polled by S&P Global Platts had forecast an average crude supply decline of 2.7 million barrels. \u201cYesterday\u2019s crude stockpile relief news in the U.S. was not a one-off event that traders forgot. A huge drop in inventories, much higher than most of the market expected, is clearly a booster factor,\u201d wrote Louise Dickson, oil markets analyst at Rystad Energy, in a Thursday report. Energy markets have also been keying in on increases in cases of COVID-19, however, with the U.S. hitting a single-day record of infections of more than 52,000, injecting some concern into crude markets about the impact of protocols to limit the spread on the economy and oil uptake.
