(Photo: Reuters/Carlo Allegri.) Paula Coates was driving home from work Tuesday when her dad called with news that Joe Biden had selected Sen. Kamala Harris of California to be the vice-presidential nominee for the Democratic party.\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was, like, \u00e2\u0080\u0098It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Kamala,'\u00e2\u0080\u009d Coates said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI literally started screaming on the phone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Coates, a pediatric dentist living in Arlington, Va. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd then tears started welling up. In a way it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sort of validation, we as Black women, those of us who support the Democratic Party, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been such a back bone, and for her to be tapped it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, like, someone is finally seeing us for the value that we bring.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0099 story resonated with Coates in other ways too. Like Coates, who graduated from Meharry Medical College\u00e2\u0080\u0099s School of Dentistry, Harris is an alumnae of a Historically Black College; she graduated from Howard University in 1986. Coates and Harris are also members of the same greek-letter organization, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc., the historically Black sorority.\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese institutions have been so significant for so long,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Coates said of HBCUs, and to finally have someone who has been a product of that ascend to a major party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidential ticket, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is amazing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d If Biden and Harris win, Coates said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be proud to be there, wrapped up, if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cold outside, in my pink and green scarf and hat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the colors of AKA.\u00c2 In recent history, presidents and vice presidents have largely graduate from a small group of colleges Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0099 candidacy represents several firsts: She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s both the first Black woman and Indian-American woman on a major party presidential ticket. And though graduates of HBCUs have represented their states in Congress and served at other high levels of government, Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0099 nomination represents the first time an alumnus of one of these schools will be featured on a major party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidential ticket. That stands in contrast to a recent history of presidential and vice presidential candidates who were alumni of predominantly white institutions \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2 and, in particular, a handful of Ivy League schools, with which the majority of Americans have no first-hand experience.\u00c2 \u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is monumental, this is huge for HBCUs to possibly be represented at the highest levels of federal government,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jelani Favors, an associate professor of history at Clayton State University and the author of \u00e2\u0080\u009cShelter in a Time of Storm: How Black Colleges Fostered Generations of Leadership and Activism.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ascension to the ticket is part of a broader narrative of HBCU graduates leading the nation during this moment, said Walter Kimbrough, the president of Dillard University, a Historically Black College in New Orleans.\u00c2 Just a few examples: Two of the other women the Biden team reportedly considered for the ticket \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams \u00e2\u0080\u0094 graduated from HBCUs. Ibram X. Kendi, the author of \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow to be an Antiracist,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a book millions of Americans have rushed to read in the wake of the killing of George Floyd by police, graduated from Florida A&M University, an HBCU.\u00c2 HBCU graduates \u00e2\u0080\u009care playing an outsized role as the country figures out how we move forward with the pandemic of COVID 19, and racism,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kimbrough said.\u00c2 Civil Rights movement \u00e2\u0080\u0098exploded out of these campuses\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Students and graduates of Historically Black Colleges and Universities have always played a prominent role in transformative politics. The schools were first founded in the 19th century as a venue to provide higher education to Black Americans, who, due to racism, were prevented from attending traditionally white institutions. Decades later, the Civil Rights movement, \u00e2\u0080\u009cexploded out of these campuses,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as Favors put it.\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey really have symbolized for several generations the hopes and dreams of African-Americans in terms of upward mobility, in terms of breaking through and conquering segregation and racism and Jim Crow in this country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Favors said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is what these institutions were really built for, they were built for this moment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d One of the leaders of the Civil Rights era, Jesse Jackson, was the last HBCU graduate to come close to the presidency, when he ran for the Democratic party nomination in 1984 and 1988.\u00c2 Giving the commencement address at his alma mater, North Carolina A&T State University, in 1988, Jackson contrasted his experience with that of his opponents, who graduated from Ivy League schools, which until very recently was one \u00e2\u0080\u009cof those boxes that racism says one must check in order to be successful, much less politically powerful,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Crystal deGregory,\u00c2 a research fellow at Middle Tennessee State University\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Center for Historic Preservation. The Los Angeles Times reported of Jackon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s speech at the time, \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098You are among the elite of the world,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jackson told the graduates. But he warned: \u00e2\u0080\u0098You must fight the odds to win. . . . When I compete with [Massachusetts Gov. Michael S.] Dukakis and Bush, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Harvard and Yale.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jackson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s candidacy combined with increased popular cultural representation of HBCUs \u00e2\u0080\u0094including on the television show, \u00e2\u0080\u009cA Different World\u00e2\u0080\u009d (where Jackson appeared as a guest) and Spike Lee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cSchool Daze\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 helped fuel a \u00e2\u0080\u009cgolden renaissance\u00e2\u0080\u009d for Black colleges during the 1980s, Favors said. We may be living through a similar moment, Favors said. Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0099 nomination, combined with pop-culture celebration of HBCUs \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including Beyonc\u00c3\u00a9\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Homecoming film and top college basketball recruit, Makur Maker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to attend Howard University \u00e2\u0080\u0094 may once again fuel increased interest in HBCUs. Already, these schools have experienced an enrollment bump in the three years leading up to 2019 in part because of the uptick in racial tension at predominantly white institutions and the increase in public displays of racism after the election of President Donald Trump. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the midst of this Black Lives Matter Movement and a lot of the insurrection and anger that we see going on in American streets right now, a lot of Black young Americans are considering Black colleges in the way they hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t done so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Favors said.\u00c2 A legacy of \u00e2\u0080\u0098political activism among Black women students at Black colleges\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Regardless of whether this moment and Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0099 candidacy provides a boost in enrollment at HBCUs, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likely the Biden-Harris ticket will be leaning on the schools, their students and alumni as they campaign.\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of the legacy at Black colleges, they are kindred spirits and kindred institutions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Favors said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhenever they see alumni at kindred institutions making these kinds of moves it typically coalesces and congeals that support across alumni networks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean support will be unconditional. Favors noted that Harris will have to contend with criticism of her record on criminal justice as San Francisco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s district attorney and California\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attorney general that surfaced during her campaign for president.\u00c2 In addition, deGregory, both an alumna and a former employee at various HBCUs, said \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe would expect that Harris would be able to transfer some of her advocacy for HBCUs as pronounced in her presidential campaign,\u00e2\u0080\u009d to her role as the vice presidential nominee.\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cEspecially given that if the Biden-Harris ticket is to be successful it will be successful in no small measure due to the support of Black women, many of them HBCU graduates and others of them members of Black Greek letter sororities,\u00e2\u0080\u009d deGregory said.\u00c2 Indeed, those women paved the way for Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rise, she added. Members of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Inc., a Black sorority founded at Howard University in 1913, participated in a historic women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suffrage march that year, standing up both for their right to vote and to the racism that pervaded the movement.\u00c2 Harris \u00e2\u0080\u009cstands in a much larger political history of political activism among Black women students at Black colleges,\u00e2\u0080\u009d deGregory said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a full circle. They were Howard students. They were sorority women. She is a Howard graduate, and she is a sorority woman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}]}
