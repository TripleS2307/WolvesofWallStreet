Then it was put to the test. UI Public Affairs: Fred Zwicky In late summer, as evidence began trickling out about what an in-person semester at college might look like amid a pandemic \u2014 hundreds of positive cases of COVID-19, school officials threatening suspension for partying, and in some cases, sending an entire campus home \u2014 headlines (including in this outlet), wondered aloud whether one school had figured out how to bring students back safely. At the University of Illinois, students and faculty were required to take a rapid COVID-19 test developed by the school twice a week. To access any campus building, except the dorm in which they lived, students would need to show a negative test result delivered to an app, also developed by technologists at the school. The experts involved in designing the system said they\u2019d know within a few weeks, or by around Sept. 25, whether they were successful at minimizing the spread of COVID on campus. Sept. 25 passed Friday and the seven-day positivity rate at the school currently stands at 0.35%. It\u2019s still early, but that figure suggests the school is doing something right. Nationally, the COVID-19 positivity rate for the entire U.S. is about 4.8%, according to Johns Hopkins University. But the school didn\u2019t get there exactly how officials had planned. The scientists anticipated an initial spike in positive cases after students returned to campus, said Rebecca Lee Smith, an associate professor of pathobiology at U of I who is part of the team that developed the school\u2019s testing and other protocols. But the school\u2019s seven-day positivity rate average, which peaked at 1.2% and is single day positivity rate, which peaked at 2.86% on Aug. 30, about a week after classes started, was much higher than they had forecast. Though the school\u2019s scientists had built into their model the idea that students would not follow the school\u2019s guidelines 100% of the time \u2014 they would probably socialize without masks or go to crowded bars \u2014 \u201cwe did not expect people to know that they were positive and still go to parties,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThat didn\u2019t seem to us like something that would happen.\u201d But it did, according to university officials, causing an outbreak they might not have caught so quickly without the school\u2019s robust testing. In response, officials blamed \u201cthe irresponsible actions of a small number of students\u201d for the outbreak, tactics for which other schools had been criticized. Officials suspended a small number of students for violating COVID-related guidelines and threatened a return to remote instruction. First though, they implemented a two-week cool down period, asking students to limit their activity outside of their homes to attending class, grocery shopping, their twice weekly COVID-19 test and outdoor activity only with the people they live with. \u201cIt definitely had a good effect,\u201d Smith said of the lock down. But it\u2019s still too early to tell whether it pushed case numbers down for good, she said.\u2018I felt terrible for them\u2019 During the lockdown period, which ended on Sept. 16, Hallie Workman, a PhD candidate in communications at the school, said she didn\u2019t see an uptick in positive cases among the small sample of undergraduates enrolled in her public speaking course. But the share of her students exposed to COVID-19 did go up. Some of Workman\u2019s students had to go into quarantine or isolation. \u201cI felt terrible for them,\u201d she said. Reports of inconsistent food deliveries to quarantine and isolation housing pushed her to offer grocery deliveries to her students. \u201cI was checking in with them about every other day just making sure they were getting what they needed,\u201d Workman said. During the period when case positivity rates were relatively high, Workman said she also changed or completely cut out activities where she would ask students to move around the classroom. \u201cIt made me think a lot about how my students are moving within the space of my classroom and being really cautious when that rate was high,\u201d Workman said. She still feels safe teaching in person, Workman said, because her classroom is an environment she can control. \u201cI\u2019ve met with a lot of students who are saying this is my only in-person class and I need that in-person experience,\u201d Workman said, which has kept her motivated to keep teaching in person. A lockdown filled with walks and improving productivity For Owen Stephenson, the university\u2019s threat to send students home if case rates remained high was enough to convince him to follow the lockdown rules closely. As a freshman, he was eager to remain on campus in person. At first, he found the experience to be \u201cmonotonous\u201d and \u201cdreary.\u201d With only one in-person class, he rarely left his dorm, except to pick up food. But then Stephenson said, he started to find ways to cope. He signed up for online courses on fashion and productivity, even buying a journal and planner to implement what he\u2019d learned; he expanded his music tastes, working with his roommate on playlists; he took hour or more long walks, exploring campus and the surrounding areas. The fact that the positivity rate has gone down, \u201creally reaffirmed my faith that we\u2019ll have a safe semester,\u201d he said. \u201cIt made those nights where we stayed in and ate dinner on TV trays rather than out on the quad a lot more meaningful because it resulted in something.\u201d Still, the first few weeks on campus were \u201crockier\u201d than he expected and the lockdown period posed challenges for making new friends \u2014 a daunting task for freshmen during any fall semester. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a concern of if I don\u2019t make friends right now or if I don\u2019t establish myself as a member of a community right way then I\u2019m not going to be anywhere near social,\u201d Stephenson said. \u201cIt was hard to remember that I have to wait,\u201d to make more typical college memories, he said. Wistful for a typical college semester During the lockdown, Ian Katsnelson, a junior, avoided not only the activities he\u2019d grown used to in his first two years of college, but also the ones he\u2019d grown accustomed to during the first few weeks of school, like seeing friends other than his roommates from a social distance outside. \u201cIt was an interesting time on campus because you even had to be careful going outside with your roommates,\u201d he said of the lockdown period. \u201cFor me having that higher amount of university scrutiny meant that potentially if it worked out I\u2019d be able to stay for the entire semester safely.\u201d Though Zackary Landers said he\u2019s confident in the university\u2019s approach to the pandemic, he\u2019s wistful for a college experience not plagued by COVID-19. Landers, 25, attended the University of Illinois for a semester in 2013, then left to join the Navy for five and a half years. He decided to return in August 2019 and he and his fianc\u00e9 bought a house near the school. \u201cOnce this all happened, it was just this slow walk towards, \u2018This is going to be maybe more than an entire year of my Illinois experience,\u2019\u201d he said. So far, Landers said, he\u2019s become friendly with some people through a student organization or classes. \u201cI\u2019ve been able to hit it off with one guy in my discussion session and we text, but he\u2019s in the suburbs,\u201d he said. \u201cUsually we\u2019d be hanging out and studying or playing frisbee in the quad, now it\u2019s just texting.\u201d Early hiccups in the testing regimen have dissipated Workman said her students appear to have adjusted to the pandemic college reality and some of the early hiccups of the testing regimen \u2014 like difficulty gaining building access \u2014 appear to have been resolved. \u201cThe students have realized that they need to be responsible,\u201d Workman said. \u201cI\u2019m a little less happy with how the university has dealt,\u201d with the situation, she said, citing concerns about the treatment of students in isolation and quarantine as well as building workers. High-risk students are now tested three times a week In the weeks since the initial spike, the team that came up with the university\u2019s COVID-19 protocol has expanded to include a group that contacts students via text within 30 minutes of a positive test result to help them understand next steps, including that they\u2019ll be contacted by the local public health authority, Smith said. In addition, they\u2019ve hired student employees who arrange check-in calls and Zoom social activities for students in quarantine and isolation. Perhaps most critically, they\u2019ve adjusted their testing. Students at high risk of exposure are being tested three times a week, while graduate students and faculty are only being tested once a week, Smith said. \u2018We\u2019ll continue to watch University of Illinois\u2019 Still, University of Illinois\u2019 experience highlights the challenges of reopening a college in person even with thorough planning. Recent research linked colleges that opened for in-person classes to 3,000 new cases of COVID-19 per day. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to ask people to quarantine or isolate for 10 to 14 days and that\u2019s certainly been the observation on college campuses,\u201d said Joshua Salomon, the director of the Prevention Policy Modeling Lab at Stanford University. Models make the best assumptions that they can based on the information they have and good ones adjust to the information they observe, he said. He was pleased to see the University of Illinois respond to the data they observed. The spike at the school helped to \u201cexpose a weak link\u201d in the school\u2019s and other campuses\u2019 reopening strategy, he said. \u201cI would expect that models moving forward would be allowing for imperfect quarantine and isolation adherence,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to watch University of Illinois and see how the transmission trends unfold and see how the administration responds to that. There\u2019s still no guarantee that the rest of the semester is going to conclude without big outbreaks or that they\u2019re not going to have to shift their strategy again.\u201d"}]}
