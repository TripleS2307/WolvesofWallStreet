Citing people familiar with the matter, the report said the restructuring, which is expected to begin in the coming weeks, comes as earnings from movie tickets, cable subscriptions and TV ads have taken a hit from the COVID-19 pandemic. The layoffs will affect AT&T's Warner Bros. studios, as well as TV channels such as HBO, TBS and TNT, the report said. The layoffs are in addition to the more than 500 jobs WarnerMedia eliminated at Warner Bros. in August. AT&T's stock rose 1.0% in afternoon trading. It has shed 26.9% year to date, while the SPDR Communications Services Select Sector ETF XLC, +0.60% has rallied 11.8% and the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% has gained 6.6%."}]}
