The letter sent by Dr. Robert Redfield asks governors to fast-track permits and licenses for sites and warns them the usual time needed for such steps \"presents a significant barrier to the success of this urgent public health program.\" It suggests that states could issue waivers on some requirements to speed up the process. Trump officials have said they would have a vaccine ready soon, even though trials are ongoing and are not expected to be completed any time soon."}]}
