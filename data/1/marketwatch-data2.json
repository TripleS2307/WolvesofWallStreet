Trump was scheduled to deliver remarks on Saturday at 2 p.m. from the South Portico balcony at the White House, officials said. Officials declined to comment on the subject of his remarks or who would be in the audience. Campaign aides said the president was expected to hold a rally in Florida on Monday. Officials have been also considering travel in Michigan and Pennsylvania. A campaign spokesman declined to comment. Trump said in a Fox News interview Thursday night that he might do a campaign rally in Florida Saturday and in Pennsylvania Sunday, but officials said he doesn\u2019t plan to travel this weekend. Trump hasn\u2019t held a campaign rally since Minnesota on Sept. 30, when White House aide Hope Hicks fell ill. Hicks tested positive on the morning of Oct. 1 and Trump, after attending a fundraiser in New Jersey that afternoon, announced that night that he also tested positive for COVID-19.
