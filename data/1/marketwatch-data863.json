The rise in equity markets and low funding costs encouraged chief executives with strong balance sheets to spend their cash on buying growth. In one day alone, companies across a range of sectors and geographies announced deals worth more than $89.5 billion, according to financial data provider Refinitiv. Nvidia NVDA, -0.54%, which makes the microchips used for games, said it was buying U.K.-based chip designer Arm from SoftBank 9984, -1.24% for $40 billion; U.S. drugmaker Gilead Sciences GILD, +0.82% paid $21 billion to acquire biotech Immunomedics IMMU, +0.31% and Verizon Communications VZ, +0.23% snapped up Tracfone, a unit of Mexican telecom Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil AMOV, +0.31%, for $6.25 billion. That made it the highest Monday total since June 10, 2019 \u2014 and has provided a welcome boost to M&A levels, which sank at the height of the coronavirus pandemic as companies preserved their cash. Now, global mergers and acquisitions volumes have reached $1.97 trillion, down 28% compared with the same period in 2019. Technology deals are soaring, rising 18.6% in value from a year ago to mark the highest level since 2000, Refinitiv data shows.

Buyout groups, which are hoarding $1.5 trillion in unspent capital, according to data provider Preqin, should send deal making activity even higher. \u201cWith vast sums of private equity to be deployed, there may be many deals and takeovers as we head into the autumn,\u201d said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com. The immediate winners of the M&A frenzy are the shareholders of the acquired companies. But beyond the rush of excitement lies the question of whether chief executives have now entered into a cycle of excess and are launching bids at the top of the market. According to Goldman Sachs, there have been three moments of significant M&A downturns in the last 30 years \u2014 in 1990-1991; 2001-2002; and 2008-2009. \u201cDuring each of those periods, M&A volumes declined by about 50% over a two-year period followed by another three to six years before volumes recovered to their prior peaks,\u201d the U.S. bank said in its Global M&A outlook in June. Michael Carr, global co-heads of M&A at Goldman Sachs, said that while every cycle is unique, recoveries after severe downturns tend to follow three types of \u201cwaves,\u201d with the first characterized by involuntary M&A deals, such as bankruptcy sales or forced asset sales to generate liquidity. \u201cWe believe we\u2019ve entered the second wave of M&A, known as \u201cnear-in M&A,\u201d where management teams are looking close to home for potential combinations or joint ventures as a way to reduce transaction risks,\u201d Carr added. A look back in history shows that AOL\u2019s $164 billion takeover of Time Warner marked the apex of the late 1990s equity boom, while Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s \u20ac71 billion takeover of ABN Amro and Rio Tinto\u2019s $38 billion acquisition of Alcan were struck at the height of the 2007 debt boom. Neither of those deals was a success and all symbolized executive hubris. Shortly after they were announced, stock markets peaked and M&A activity dropped sharply. They also wiped out so much shareholder value that they ultimately cost the CEOs of the bidding companies their jobs and triggered huge write downs when it became clear that the promised synergies were unattainable. Professor Scott Moeller, director of the M&A research center at The Business School (formerly Cass), said that, in terms of returns to shareholders, there is clear evidence that the best time for deals is early in the cycle. \u201cEven though we\u2019ve seen a huge surge in deals in recent weeks, we could be at the beginning of the wave that marks the peak,\u201d Moeller said. \u201cThe end of the wave tends to produce financially-driven deals and we are still seeing strategic deals which is encouraging,\u201d he added. There is one certainty for investors: the longer the cycle, the deeper the trough. And that is when M&A becomes no different to any other time."}]}
