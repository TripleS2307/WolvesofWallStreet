Two years ago, a contentious clash over Trump\u2019s choice of Brett Kavanaugh for the court was credited with bolstering GOP gains in the Senate in an otherwise disastrous midterm election. And now, just 44 days before Election Day, Republicans are again looking to a Supreme Court nomination fight to unite a deeply fractured party as it faces the very real possibility of losing the White House and control of the Senate this fall. GOP leaders are optimistic they can pull it off. In the turbulent Trump era, nothing has motivated the Republican Party\u2019s disparate factions to come home quite like the prospect of a lifetime appointment to the nation\u2019s highest court. \u201cThis can be an important galvanizing force for President Trump,\u201d said Leonard Leo, co-chairman of the conservative Federalist Society who has advised the Trump administration on its first two confirmations, of Neil Gorsuch and Kavanaugh. The emerging nomination debate that follows the death Friday of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg threatens to reshuffle voter priorities in the closing weeks of an election that had been squarely focused on another set of generational issues: the pandemic, economic devastation and deep civil unrest. Trump, backed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, is pledging to replace the liberal Ginsburg with a conservative jurist, promising on Saturday evening that he will announce his nominee \u201cvery soon.\u201d See:Biden to senators: Extinguish the \u2018flames\u2019 engulfing U.S. politics by not \u2018jamming\u2019 through a Supreme Court justice Plans are in motion for a swift nomination and confirmation. Lest there be any questions about the political implications, Trump is expected to make his choice in a matter of days. Those close to the president are encouraging him to announce his pick before the first presidential debate against Democratic challenger Joe Biden on Sept. 29. Biden said the winner of the Nov. 3 election should choose the next justice. Biden\u2019s team is skeptical that the Supreme Court clash will fundamentally change the contours of a race Trump was trailing so close to Election Day. Indeed, five states are already voting. In fact, Democrats say it could motivate voters to fight harder against Trump and Republicans as the Senate breaks the norms with an unprecedented confirmation at a time when Americans are deciding crucial elections. \u201cEverything Americans value is at stake,\u201d Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told fellow Democratic senators on a conference call Saturday, according to a person who was not authorized to publicly discuss the private call and spoke on condition of anonymity. Biden is not planning to release a full list of potential court nominees, according to a top aide, because it would further politicize the process. The aide was not authorized to publicly discuss private deliberations and spoke on condition of anonymity. Biden\u2019s team suggests that the court fight will heighten the focus on issues that were already at stake in the election: health care, environmental protections, gender equity and abortion. Health care, in particular, has been a top voter concern this pandemic-year election, Democrats say. They will argue that protections for Americans with preexisting conditions are essentially on the ballot as the Supreme Court will hear the administration\u2019s argument to strike down President Barack Obama\u2019s health law shortly after the election. The Affordable Care Act includes such protections and the court is expected to render a verdict next year. \u201cMake it real,\u201d said Hillary Clinton, urging Democrats to take the fight to the polls, in an interview on MSNBC. See:Biden says death of Justice Ginsburg highlights threats to U.S. health care Republicans say voters, particularly those the party needs to win back, are motivated by the chance to name a conservative judge \u2014 so much so that it could take some states off the map for Democrats. The focus on the nomination fight could help unify such voters around a common issue in an election season with so many distractions, said Leo of the Federalist Society. \u201cGoing as far back as 2000, poll after poll shows that the Supreme Court is an issue that resonates strongly with Republican and conservative voters, and importantly even with low-propensity voters from those groups,\u201d he said. Republicans were especially optimistic that the court battle would boost their chances of holding the Senate, particularly in Republican-leaning states such as Montana, Iowa, Kansas, Georgia and South Carolina where GOP candidates are at risk. Democrats need to pick up three seats to claim the Senate majority if Biden wins and four if he doesn\u2019t. Key GOP senators who face tough reelection contests in such states where Trump is popular quickly linked themselves to his push for a swift vote, embracing the prospect of another conservative on the bench. Among them: Martha McSally in Arizona, Thom Tillis in North Carolina and Lindsey Graham in South Carolina. Yet other Republicans in more contested battleground states, including Sen. Cory Gardner in Colorado, held back, heeding McConnell\u2019s advice to keep their \u201cpowder dry.\u201d Two Republicans, Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, spoke out after Ginsburg\u2019s death to object to the speedy pace, saying the Senate should not vote before the election so the candidate elected on Nov. 3 can decide. As he left the White House for Saturday evening\u2019s rally in North Carolina, Trump signaled his displeasure with Collins \u2014 and a potential warning to other wayward Republicans: \u201cI totally disagree with her,\u201d he said. Democratic challengers and outside allies seized on what they called \u201chypocrisy\u201d of Republicans refusing to consider Obama\u2019s nominee before the 2016 election, unearthing past statements from many of the same senators now pushing ahead for Trump. The Democrats raised more than $71 million in the hours after Ginsburg\u2019s death. Many Republicans are hopeful the Supreme Court fight will supersede many conservative voters\u2019 concerns about Trump\u2019s inconsistent leadership and divisive rhetoric. But voters in key states are already dealing with unprecedented hardships that will not simply disappear in the coming weeks. Conservative activist Tim Phillips, president of the group Americans for Prosperity, is doubtful that the court fight will change many votes. He spent much of Saturday canvassing suburban neighborhoods around Kansas City as part of his organization\u2019s massive push to boost down-ballot Republicans in November. When conservative activists gathered in the morning, the Supreme Court was a prime topic of conversation that \u201cstrengthened their resolve to get out and work,\u201d Phillips said. But once they started knocking on voters\u2019 doors, \u201cit didn\u2019t even come up.\u201d \u201cI just think given the magnitude of the crises \u2014 plural \u2014 facing swing voters, this is just not going to be a crucial factor in their final decision,\u201d Phillips said. At the Cambria County Republican Party headquarters in western Pennsylvania, the vacancy wasn\u2019t a major topic of conversation as people swung by on Saturday to pick up yard signs and campaign swag. Lisa Holgash, a 49-year-old Trump supporter, said she would \u201clove it\u201d if Trump were able to appoint another Supreme Court Justice. But she said she was concerned about the idea of Republicans pushing through a nominee so quickly ahead of the election, especially after Republicans denied Obama a final pick in his last year. \u201cIt\u2019s not that far now to the election,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it should be rushed.\u201d See:Flowers, homemade signs, singing outside Supreme Court in Ginsburg tribute"}]}
