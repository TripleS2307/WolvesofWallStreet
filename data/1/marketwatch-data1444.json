The university helps insulate the town as students fill up rental units, restaurants and\u00c2 bars, and spend money at local stores. Plus time-honored traditions\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2 like parents\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2 weekends, graduations and football games\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2 bring an influx of visitors to town, reliably pumping money into the local economy.\u00c2 But nowhere is entirely pandemic-proof. Not even university towns. College towns\u00e2\u0080\u0099 economic shields came down when universities were forced to close their physical campuses due to COVID-19 and in the middle of the spring semester, shifting to\u00c2 distance learning. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCOVID is a much different downturn, not only because of its removal of students from communities and the economic impact they generate, but also the likely classification of university staff as nonessential,\u00e2\u0080\u009d explains Drew Repp from\u00c2 Emsi, a labor analytics firm. While faculty remain employed, lecturing over Zoom ZM, +2.89% \u00c2 , many other university jobs, say, the dining hall workers, weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deemed essential (depending on the state), Repp explains. In fact, according to an Emsi\u00c2 analysis,\u00c2 communities with the highest share of nonessential workers\u00c2 were dominated by college towns. Still, while many college towns don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have industry diversity, a sampling of their unemployment rates weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any higher than the national unemployment rate in April.\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn that sense, you could say college towns appear to be weathering the COVID downturn as well as could be hoped,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Repp says.
