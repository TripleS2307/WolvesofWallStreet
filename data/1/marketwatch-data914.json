AstraZeneca is developing the experimental vaccine with the University of Oxford; the study was published in The Lancet. The single-blind, randomized, controlled trial found that neutralizing antibody responses were reported in 91% of 35 patients when utilizing one test and 100% of 35 patients when using a different test. It also found that T-cell responses peaked on day 14. \"A single dose elicited both humoral and cellular responses against SARS-CoV-2, with a booster immunization augmenting neutralizing antibody titers,\" the study's authors wrote. BioNTech BNTX, +1.23% and Pfizer Inc. PFE, -0.27%, which are also developing a COVID-19 vaccine, said earlier on Monday that their vaccine candidate produced a T-cell response in participants in an early-stage trial in Germany.
