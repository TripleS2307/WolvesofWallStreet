FB, +0.26% shares dipped 1.4% in extended trading Thursday after Verizon Communications Inc. VZ, +0.23% became the latest high-profile company to pull advertising over how Facebook polices misinformation and hateful speech. A Verizon spokesperson said the decision was made until Facebook and Instagram \"can create an acceptable solution that makes us comfortable.\" In recent days, Ben & Jerry's, Patagonia, Recreational Equipment Inc., and others said they plan to pause advertising on the social-networking giant, which depends almost entirely on ads for revenue. Last week, six organizations called on Facebook advertisers to suspend ad spending in July. The groups are the Anti-Defamation League, the NAACP, Sleeping Giants, Color of Change, Free Press, and Common Sense."}]}
