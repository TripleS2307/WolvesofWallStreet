Walt Disney World\u2019s Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom are reopening Saturday, while Epcot and Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios will follow four days later. \u201cIt\u2019s the chance to come back and be in the magic,\u201d said Diane Watkins, a preschool teacher from Helena, Alabama, who visits the park about eight times a year. \u201cHot or not, mask or not, we\u2019re just happy to be here. I feel like everybody here is in the same frame of mind. Everybody is just so excited to be here.\u201d Watkins said that when she and her 16-year-old daughter walked into the Magic Kingdom on Saturday morning, then saw all the cast members lined up and clapping on Main Street, she cried. \u201cIt was very emotional,\u201d she said. The reopening comes as a huge surge of Floridians have tested positive for the new coronavirus in recent weeks. On Saturday, there were about 10,000 new cases reported, according to state statistics. Many cities and counties around the state have recently reinstated restrictions that had been lifted in May, when cases seemed to drop. All of Disney\u2019s Orlando DIS, +1.53% parks closed in mid-March in an effort to stop the virus\u2019s spread. Universal Orlando and SeaWorld Orlando closed around the same time but reopened several weeks ago after instituting similar rules to protect employees and customers from the virus. Lori Lovell of Evansville, Indiana, strolled around Frontierland on Saturday morning with friends. \u201cI have missed coming here. It just feels really good to be back. This is where I\u2019ve made so many memories. It\u2019s kind of our second home. Not being able to come here was hard.\u201d Disney\u2019s new rules include mandatory masks and social distancing. Visitors will need reservations to enter a park, and they won\u2019t be allowed to hop between parks. Both visitors and employees will receive temperature checks when they enter. Fireworks shows and parades have been suspended to prevent drawing too many people together. Park-goers say that nearly everyone in sight wore masks on Saturday morning. Capacity is nowhere near where it is under normal circumstances, they said. \u201cI\u2019ve been here on spring breaks where you can barely walk around. The walkways are very wide open,\u201d said Lovell. There were lots of hand sanitizer stations around, and people were respecting the physical distancing cues and guidelines. Since the park is at lower capacity, there was only a five-minute wait for the popular Buzz Lightyear ride \u2014 normally it\u2019s about 90 minutes, Watkins said. Some attractions and dining areas aren\u2019t yet open. Another change: visitors can\u2019t hug and greet the costumed Disney characters. Instead, the characters are in \u201ccavalcades,\u201d or motorcades, as they make their way through the park. Disney has been opening its parks back up around the globe for the past two months. In May, the company opened Disney Springs, a complex of shops, restaurants and entertainment venues in Lake Buena Vista. ___"}]}
