In a terse statement, Wirecard WDI, +0.14% \u00c2 WCAGY, +2.06% \u00c2 said Braun resigned by mutual agreement and with immediate effect. James Freis, the former FinCEN director and ex-chief compliance officer of Deutsche B\u00c3\u00b6rse, was named interim chief executive of Wirecard after joining the board only on Thursday night. Wirecard also suspended Jan Marsalek, the chief operating officer. Shares of German payments processor Wirecard plunged for a second day on Friday, as the troubled firm faces the risk of banks terminating loans. Wirecard shares dropped 35%, after having dropped over 60% on Thursday when it revealed it was missing \u00e2\u0082\u00ac1.9 billion of cash, roughly a quarter of its balance sheet. The DAX component DAX, +0.06% \u00c2 has said it might be the victim of a fraud. The chief executive of a Philippines bank involved in the investigation told Bloomberg that documents had been forged. Banks have the ability to terminate \u00e2\u0082\u00ac2 billion worth of loans if Wirecard can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t finalize its 2019 accounts on Friday, according to Wirecard. Analysts at UBS said that is likely a reference to a \u00e2\u0082\u00ac1.75 billion syndicated loan, on which Wirecard has drawn down \u00e2\u0082\u00ac1 billion. Wirecard said it was \u00e2\u0080\u009cin constructive discussions with its lending banks with regard to the continuation of the credit lines and the further business relationship.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wirecard sold a \u00e2\u0082\u00ac900 million convertible bond to SoftBank Group in April."}]}
