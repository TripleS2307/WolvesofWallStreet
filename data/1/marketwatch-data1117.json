The unexpected news comes as the race for the U.S. presidency between Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden is heating up. Some strategists speculate that the news forces investors to come to terms with the front-runner status of Democratic challenger Biden, who was already leading in most national polls against Trump. \u201cGold picked up a bit overnight on the Trump diagnosis news\u201d but turned back downward \u201cas it has become clear that the news has not sparked a panic rush out of equities into defensive havens like gold,\u201d Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management, told MarketWatch. Equity markets were down Friday, but the Dow Jones Industrial Index DJIA, +0.56% was trading off the session\u2019s worst levels. On Friday, December gold GCZ20, +2.17% fell $8.70, or nearly 0.5%, to settle at $1,907.60 an ounce on Comex, after gaining 1.1% on Thursday to finish at around a two-week peak. Silver for December delivery SIZ20, +5.96%, meanwhile, lost 23 cents, or 0.9%, to $24.029 an ounce, following a 3.2% rise in the previous session.

Prices for both precious metals had posted declines last month. \u201cThe lack of fresh stimulus from the Federal Reserve and political gridlock precluding fiscal aid have been dominant factors behind this gold retracement and associated dollar strength,\u201d said Ryan Giannotto, director of research at GraniteShares, which offers the GraniteShares Gold Trust BAR, +1.88%. Still, \u201cthe halt on additional stimulus is not altogether bearish for gold, as stock prices require monetary and fiscal support to a far greater extent than gold,\u201d he told MarketWatch. \u201cWaning economic optimism and a growing second wave of mass layoffs from companies like Disney, American Airlines and others firmly underscore this point and the need for gold as a diversifying asset.\u201d The U.S. presidential election, meanwhile, increases uncertainty and Trump\u2019s COVID-19 diagnosis \u201cemphasizes the realities of risk before us,\u201d he said, adding that gold may be poised for further gains. The rise in prices for the precious metals on the week came as the U.S. dollar has receded somewhat after last week\u2019s rally, providing more room for dollar-based assets to rise. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, -0.58% has declined 0.9% so far this week but was trading about 0.1% higher in Friday dealings, as gauged by the index which measures the buck\u2019s strength against a half-dozen currencies. A weaker dollar can make asset\u2019s priced in the monetary unit relatively more expensive to overseas buyers. Gold prices fell early Friday in the immediate wake of U.S. employment data that revealed 661,000 new jobs in September, but hiring was the smallest since businesses reopened from lockdowns imposed to combat the pandemic. The precious metal then briefly pared some losses shortly after data showed U.S. factory orders rose 0.7% in August, up for a fourth straight month, but the increase was below the 0.9% rise expected by economists surveyed by MarketWatch. \u201cEmployment data underwhelming and below consensus didn\u2019t have much impact on gold,\u201d Jeff Wright, executive vice president of GoldMining Inc., told MarketWatch. The market is looking for signs of progress between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on another fiscal stimulus bill, he said. It\u2019s \u201canyone\u2019s guess if there is really a deal to be struck.\u201d The U.S. dollar will provide direction for gold into next week and an agreement on fiscal stimulus would weaken the greenback, he said. Also on Nymex Friday, December copper HGZ20, +1.38% tacked on 3.9% to $2.9775 a pound, tallying a weekly rise of 0.2%. January platinum PLF21, +3.84% lost 1.6% to $891.40 an ounce, with most-active contract prices up 5.9% for the week. December palladium PAZ20, +2.31% fell 0.1% to $2,325 an ounce Friday for a weekly rise of 4.6%."}]}
