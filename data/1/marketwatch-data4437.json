Urquiza's 65-year-old father, Mark, died from COVID-19 in June, and her obituary for him went viral after she blamed President Donald Trump, Arizona Gov. Rob Ducey and other politicians for his death, and the deaths of tens of thousands of others. \"His death is due to the carelessness of the politicians who continue to jeopardize the health of brown bodies through a clear lack of leadership, refusal to acknowledge the severity of this crisis, and inability and unwillingness to give clear and decisive direction on how to minimize risk,\" she wrote in the obit. On Monday, Urquiza was a guest speaker for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, on the first night of the virtual convention.

A few weeks later, he was put on a ventilator. And after five agonizing days, he died alone, in the ICU, with a nurse holding his hand.\" \"My dad was a healthy 65-year-old,\" she said. \"His only pre-existing condition was trusting Donald Trump, and for that, he paid with his life.\" Read: 'Don't vote for a killer.'
