Urquiza\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 65-year-old father, Mark, died from COVID-19 in June, and her obituary for him went viral after she blamed President Donald Trump, Arizona Gov. Rob Ducey and other politicians for his death, and the deaths of tens of thousands of others. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis death is due to the carelessness of the politicians who continue to jeopardize the health of brown bodies through a clear lack of leadership, refusal to acknowledge the severity of this crisis, and inability and unwillingness to give clear and decisive direction on how to minimize risk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she wrote in the obit. On Monday, Urquiza was a guest speaker for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, on the first night of the virtual convention.
