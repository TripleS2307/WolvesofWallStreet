(Photo by Olivier DOULIERY / AFP) (Photo by OLIVIER DOULIERY/AFP via Getty Images) Senate Republicans are aiming to unveil a new \u00e2\u0080\u009ctargeted\u00e2\u0080\u009d coronavirus aid bill next week once lawmakers return from a break, a senior White House official and a Wyoming senator said Tuesday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI expect them to pass a bill or at least put forth a bill in hopes of getting to that 60-vote threshold sometime next week,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, said in a televised interview Tuesday.. His comments echoed those of Sen. John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican who presided over a brief ceremonial session of the Senate earlier today. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have a focused, targeted solution that we hope that the House would pass and the House would agree to. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s focused on getting people back to work, getting kids back to school,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told a reporter after the session. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the goal, is to come back and vote to move to that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Barrasso said. The Republican-led Senate returns Tuesday after its traditional summer break that began this year on Aug. 13. The Democratic-held House of Representatives comes back the week after, though some House committees will be in action next week to tee up bills for floor action later. Little has changed since both chambers saw their members leave for the summer break. The White House has taken executive actions it says will help keep the economy afloat after some provisions of the CARES Act lapsed, though there is disagreement over how timely and effective measures will be. In the meantime, both House Democrats and the White House have edged away from previous positions on the size of a package. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said Democrats would accept a $2.2 trillion deal, down from the $3.4 trillion price tag of the bill the House passed in May. Meadows has said the White House has offered a $1.3 trillion proposal, up from the $1.1 trillion. But what would be in those packages and how much would go where appeared to still be far from resolved. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, testifying before a House committee set up to oversee coronavirus relief efforts, said he thought a deal was still possible. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe a bipartisan agreement still should be reached and would provide substantial funds for schools, testing, vaccines, PPP for small businesses, continued enhanced unemployment benefits, child care, nutrition, agriculture, and the U.S. Postal Service, along with liability protection for universities, schools, and businesses,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said in his opening statement to the panel. Mnuchin, only days before the next monthly jobs report is to be released, said the CARES Act passed in March had helped the economy mend and that it continued to rebound. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor the third month in a row, the jobs report exceeded forecasts, with a gain of 1.8 million jobs in July. This brings our three-month total gain to more than 9 million jobs, meaning that over 41 percent of jobs lost due to the pandemic have been recovered,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Meadows said more unilateral actions by the White House were a possibility in lieu of a new deal, including potentially help for the airline industry, which is looking at layoffs. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking very closely at a number of executive actions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhether we can actually do that to help the airlines or not still remains an open question.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Meadows said he met late yesterday with President Donald Trump on the issue of airlines aid specifically. Pelosi has said the White House has not taken the coronavirus seriously enough and has refused to pony up the money necessary to fight it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also dismissed the science on the disease, she said Monday evening in an interview on MSNBC. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat further evidence does\u00c2 anyone need that this President\u00c2 didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care less about the\u00c2 spread of this virus than to see\u00c2 what he did, vandalizing, by the\u00c2 way, the White House by bringing\u00c2 all those people there, no masks,\u00c2 no distancing and the rest?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked. \u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe slapped science right in the\u00c2 face, and what a bad example that was.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}]}
