Shares GPN, +1.22% \u00c2 are up 1.2% in Monday afternoon trading. Through the partnership with Amazon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AMZN, +3.01% AWS, Global Payments will create a cloud-based processing platform for card issuers. Global Payments\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Chief Executive Jeff Sloan said that the arrangement would \u00e2\u0080\u009clevel the playing field for large financial institutions\u00e2\u0080\u009d by giving them access to technology-oriented offerings that could help them to deliver more modern consumer experiences and move more quickly to bring about feature improvements. Things like the rollout of contactless payment options and improved digital banking experiences \u00e2\u0080\u009ccan all be done better, faster, and cheaper in the cloud,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sloan told MarketWatch. The AWS arrangement is about \u00e2\u0080\u009cletting large financial institutions globally access the same technology that startups did,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.

Sloan said that overall, the arrangement could more than triple the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s addressable market in issuer solutions. Global Payments beat earnings and revenue expectations for the second quarter despite (and perhaps, even partly due to) the pandemic, and Sloan pointed to sequential improvement from month to month during the period, while some aspects of the business returned to year-over-year growth in June. Further, trends were \u00e2\u0080\u009cstable\u00e2\u0080\u009d throughout July \u00e2\u0080\u009cand even slightly improving over what we saw in June,\u00e2\u0080\u009d President Cameron Bready said on Global Payments\u00e2\u0080\u0099 earnings call. Sloan told MarketWatch that Global Payments saw a 16% increase in the e-commerce and omnichannel category during the second quarter, excluding travel. He disclosed on the earnings call that this part of the business accounts for 20% of merchant revenue.

He said that it can be difficult to get consumers to change their behavior in terms of payment preferences but that people are unlikely to revert to old habits once they have made a change.

Activating facial recognition is more difficult in the age of the pandemic since masks block the nose and mouth. Global Payments, which merged with fellow financial technology company Total System Services in September, earned an adjusted $1.31 a share for the second quarter, down from $1.51 a share a year earlier but ahead of the $1.21 a share that analysts surveyed by FactSet had been forecasting. Revenue rose to $1.67 billion from $935 million. Shares have gained 11.3% over the past three months as the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% \u00c2 has risen 16.5%."}]}
