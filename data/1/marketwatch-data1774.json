Redfield was overheard by NBC News on a phone call flying from Atlanta to Washington. He confirmed that he was talking about Atlas, who was added to the White House team in August as a neuroradiologist with no background in infectious diseases or public health.

In a statement provided to NBC News, Atlas defended himself, explaining \u00e2\u0080\u009ceverything I have said is directly from the data and the science.
