Ray Maslyk Two-thirds of laid-off Americans are receiving more money from their unemployment benefits than they did from their lost jobs. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largely because the $2.2 trillion stimulus package, known as the CARES Act, temporarily allocates an additional $600 a week on top of state unemployment benefits to Americans who are out of work due to the pandemic. Critics of the extra cash say that employers who want to rehire former workers simply cannot offer enough pay to compete with those generous unemployment benefits. They also argue that the extra $600 disincentivizes some people to return to work, because they can earn more money from not working. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the case for Ray Maslyk. Maslyk, 66, is grateful to be receiving $1,121 a week in unemployment benefits, even though that is far less than his weekly pay from the $70,000-a-year position he started in early January as a lead recruiter for a hotel chain based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been working in human resources for hotels and restaurants, primarily focusing on recruiting, for the past 15 years. Before moving to Florida, he worked for a furniture company that had 11 stores in the Virginia Beach area. He left that position once the company started closing some stores last year because he felt there was \u00e2\u0080\u009cmore opportunity for me out there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Little did he know that the new position he relocated for would only last a matter of months. Maslyk would gladly forfeit his weekly unemployment check if he could get his job back \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or any job, for that matter, he told MarketWatch. He heard that some of his coworkers were being hired back with 60% pay cuts. But he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already been informed that the company won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to rehire him. Related: The extra $600 Americans receive in weekly unemployment benefits ends in July \u00e2\u0080\u0094 how that could cost the U.S. more jobs He says he would happily take a full-time job that paid him less than what he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been making on unemployment benefits. Landing a permanent position is more important to him than the salary, Maslyk told MarketWatch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take me through the end of the year or next year, rather than stay on unemployment which ends in July and then panic.\u00e2\u0080\u009d July 25, he said, is the last day he will be receiving the extra $600 in unemployment benefits.That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because the CARES Act calls for these payments to end \u00e2\u0080\u009con or before July 31,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and states make these payments on a weekly cycle that ends on Saturday or Sunday. \u201c The extra $600 he and his wife have been receiving every week since the second week of March he said has been \u00e2\u0080\u009ca godsend to just keep attempting to live at least 50% of our lifestyle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u201d That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s if lawmakers don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pass the HEROES Act, which would, among other things, extend the extra $600 federal unemployment benefit to January. Several other proposals call for sliding scale of supplemental unemployment benefits that are tied to states\u00e2\u0080\u0099 jobless rates. On top of this, his wife, Brenda, 53, was also laid off from her job as an assistant manager at a laundromat. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been receiving $766 a week in unemployment benefits. After July, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be receiving just $166 a week when the supplemental $600 benefit expires if lawmakers don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take action to extend the program. The two of them have been living together in a hotel room since they moved to Florida from Virginia Beach in January. At first, Maslyk\u00e2\u0080\u0099s employer was covering the cost of staying at a hotel until he could find more permanent housing. On March 9, the hotel owner told him that because of the pandemic, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have to kick him out. \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re saving every penny we can, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not even looking at non-essential items because we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford to do that right now\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat left me with no roof over my head because we hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t signed a lease and we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to sign a lease since my position was eliminated, so we jumped into another hotel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s costing them $2,000 a month to live there, he said. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fairly confidant that they will raise their nightly rates in the fall, in which case he will have to move regardless of whether he secures a new job. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have never moved somewhere and then looked for a job. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always moved because I had an offer in that city so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another scary thing for me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. The extra $600 he and his wife have each been receiving every week since the second week of March has been \u00e2\u0080\u009ca godsend to just keep attempting to live at least 50% of our lifestyle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the $600, we wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have even been able to stay here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. Aside from the hotel costs, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been using their unemployment benefits to cover food, auto insurance payments and other essentials. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re saving every penny we can, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not even looking at non-essential items because we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford to do that right now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Maslyk told MarketWatch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not like we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on vacation. We buy groceries for dinner and save as much money as we possibly can, not knowing what the future holds for us and particularly once we lose $600.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen that drops off at the end of July, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a huge concern because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m 66 years old, and to find a position at this age is a challenge.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Employers, he thinks, are more hesitant to hire someone his age \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecause they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how long you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to stick around.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Meaning they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to hire someone who will be on the job for six months and then decide to retire, he said. That hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stopped him from applying every day to more positions. But companies have been slow to move on him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had companies that will talk to me and say \u00e2\u0080\u0098Let me give you a call back in three weeks,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Maslyk said. He said he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be willing to relocate anywhere in the country if he landed a new job. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf someone comes running and says: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Hey we need a recruiter,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to be there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In recent weeks the Trump administration has hinted at enacting return to work bonuses to incentivize people who are receiving unemployment benefits to seek out job opportunities. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut what about people like me whereby our jobs have been eliminated?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Maslyk said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish so badly I could get to these senators that are attempting to reward people for going back to work and present this question.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}]}
