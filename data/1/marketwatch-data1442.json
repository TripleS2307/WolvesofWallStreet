Although the coronavirus continues to rattle global markets and industries, some analysts expect to see greater demand for advanced manufacturing talent in the U.S. as the pandemic diminishes. That could create opportunities for older men and women, including white-collar professionals struggling to find jobs. Before COVID-19, there were 500,000 manufacturing jobs open in the U.S., according to the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM). \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a need very quickly to ramp up on hiring in those facilities that may have been shut down during the crisis or that need to expand operations,\u201d said NAM president and CEO Jay Timmons in a recent press conference. \u201c \u201cThe fact that one can get a certificate in about nine months and totally re-career into a nearly guaranteed job is an incredible opportunity for an older worker.\u201d \u201d \u2014 Nora Duncan, Connecticut state director of AARP As manufacturers frantically try to keep up again with demand for essentials and lifesaving PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) for health care workers as cases rise across the country, their innovation and high-tech problem-solving could help dispel misconceptions that all manufacturing jobs are dirty and physically demanding, said Sara Tracey, project manager of workforce services for the Ohio Manufacturers\u2019 Association in Akron, Ohio.Manufacturing jobs and what they pay Entry-level manufacturing jobs in industries such as aerospace, technology and defense include CNC operators, set-up technicians and programmers, as well as inspectors, higher-end assembly technicians and quality assurance. The pay typically ranges between $35,000 and $65,000, including overtime and benefits, said Richard DuPont, director of community and campus relations for the Advanced Manufacturing Technology Center at Housatonic Community College in Bridgeport, Conn. More experienced professionals can earn upward of $95,000. 80% of older Americans can't afford to retire - COVID-19 isn't helping In Ohio, manufacturers have been training and moving some workers into higher positions so the companies can hire and train new candidates for vacated ones, Tracey noted. Resources such as the Making Ohio website let people explore careers in manufacturing, including robotics, automation and 3-D printing. Industrial maintenance is an important career pathway these days, as well, Tracey said. This sector is expecting more retirements in the near future, which will create jobs from \u201ctraditional machine mechanics to troubleshooting state-of-the-art electronic or robotic processes,\u201d Tracey noted.

A severance package gave her time to look for work, but she couldn\u2019t find even temporary employment. She blames age discrimination by white-collar employers. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to hide how old you are. They can ask when you graduated from school,\u201d Clemens-Roberts said. But while she was out of work, Clemens-Roberts received a postcard from AARP offering a 25% tuition scholarship on advanced manufacturing programs at Goodwin University, a career-focused school in East Hartford, Conn. She wasn\u2019t interested until her husband Frank saw a TV commercial touting the benefits of Goodwin\u2019s manufacturing and other programs. \u201cHe said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you think about changing careers?\u2019\u201d Clemens-Roberts recalled. So, with several months left on her severance, she enrolled in a full-time, six-month CNC (Computer Numerical Control) Machining, Metrology and Manufacturing Technology certification program. It would prepare her for a job working with automated machine tools which requires mathematical skills, attention to detail and critical thinking. SectorWatch: 80% of older Americans can\u2019t afford to retire - COVID-19 isn\u2019t helping Scholarships cut Clemens-Roberts\u2019 tuition bill from $7,000 to $3,200. After a two-month paid internship at TOMZ, a manufacturer of precision components for major medical devices in Berlin, Conn., she was hired in April 2019. Six months later, TOMZ reimbursed Clemens-Roberts $1,500 for her education tab. Clemens-Roberts said her family is now in a better financial position than when she was working in a bank, living paycheck-to-paycheck. Considered an essential worker, she has kept her full-time job through the pandemic, except for three days in March. \u201cI never thought I would go to college and participate in a graduation \u2014 in cap and gown,\u201d Clemens-Roberts said. \u201cThat was a big surprise. And [actor] Danny Glover was the speaker. A bucket-list experience.\u201d There\u2019s \u201cobviously age discrimination, among other things, at play\u201d for job seekers over 50, said Nora Duncan, Connecticut state director of AARP. \u201cThe fact that one can get a certificate in about nine months and totally re-career into a nearly guaranteed job is an incredible opportunity for an older worker.\u201d While AARP helped Clemens-Roberts pay for the tuition initially, the internship helped her get hired as a machine operator.Older and younger manufacturing workers helping each other The search for skilled manufacturing labor across the country is creating opportunities for workers of all ages, said DuPont. And older and younger generations working together are assisting each other. The older students help younger classmates with life skills, while younger students can help with technology,\u201d said DuPont. \u201cTogether, they make excellent teams.\u201d Don\u2019t miss: How will the robots see you through the pandemic? Just ask Fernando Vega, 62, who is now a quality inspector at Forrest Machine, in Berlin, Conn. It makes precision-machined parts and other components for the aerospace and commercial industries. In the 1990s, he was a quality inspector before recessions and outsourcing forced him to consider other careers. He tried working for a nonprofit and though Vega found the work rewarding, it wasn\u2019t financially sustainable. So, Vega went back to school in spring 2018 to study advanced manufacturing at Goodwin. \u201cI was in a class of 18, and at first everyone kept to themselves. But when it came time to read blueprints, there was some panic and I said, \u2018Don\u2019t panic, I\u2019ll show you.\u2019 The [younger] students helped me with trigonometry, and then we started to work together.\u201d Vega has worked at his manufacturing job throughout the pandemic. At one point, he was putting in 50 hours a week, but that was reduced to 40 hours plus overtime. Vega recalled promising his mother that he would go to college. \u201cBut that was a long time ago,\u201d he said. His mother never got to see him graduate but Vega feels he\u2019s fulfilled his promise \u2014 not only to her, but also to himself. \u201cI love my job,\u201d he said.
