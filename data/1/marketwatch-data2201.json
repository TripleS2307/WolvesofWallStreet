And recent Atlantic storm-related refinery snags and the expected seasonal slowdown in fuel consumption may do little to shake things up for long. \u201cGasoline prices have seen little movement during summer, probably the most stability in at least 10 [to] 15 years,\u201d says Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, an app that tracks travel and navigation. \u201c \u2018Gasoline prices have seen little movement during summer, probably the most stability in at least 10 [to] 15 years.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Patrick De Haan, GasBuddy The national average price for regular unleaded has generally stood between $2.16 and $2.20 in the last eight weeks, he says. That\u2019s a \u201ctremendous\u201d feat given the \u201ctug of war going on between market forces,\u201d which include the pandemic. On Thursday morning, retail gasoline stood not far from that range, at $2.235 a gallon, according to GasBuddy. Prices are up by over a nickel from a month ago, but down about 35 cents from a year ago. On the futures market, front-month September gasoline US:RBU20 fell by more than 6% to $1.2733 a gallon in Thursday dealings, trading around 0.9% lower week to date.

Gasoline demand in the third week of August was down by a little over 1% from a week earlier, he says, as \u201csummer fades and it\u2019s back to school for many, even if it\u2019s online only.\u201d Compared with demand a year ago, \u201cwe\u2019re in the ballpark of down 15%,\u201d though demand did see a big increase in Louisiana over the Aug. 22-23 weekend when the storms known as Marco and Laura were headed toward the U.S. Gulf Coast, says De Haan. Marco made landfall as a tropical storm Monday, while Laura reached Texas and Louisiana with winds of as high as 150 miles an hour late Wednesday. Typically, demand climbs ahead of the storms, with much less demand after\u2014usually leading to a \u201cnotable net loss in the affected area,\u201d De Haan says. This year, however, it\u2019s difficult to compare demand impact between the most recent Atlantic storms and past storms, because Covid-19 has \u201cmuted\u201d consumption so much already. Storms can bring disruptions from rain, as well as power outages. Hurricane Harvey in 2017 led to a 14% jump in national average gasoline prices about two weeks after making landfall, says Ken Robinson, market research manager at reimbursement platform Motus. Harvey caused excessive flooding and \u201ctraversed most of the Gulf Coast\u2019s refinery infrastructure.\u201d More than 45% of total U.S. petroleum refining capacity is located along the Gulf Coast, according to the Energy Information Administration. As the region recovers from the latest storms, Robinson says key refineries to watch are the Motiva refinery in Port Arthur and Marathon Petroleum\u2019s MPC, -3.21% at Galveston Bay, both in Texas. The fuel market, however, may not see a big supply shortage. With U.S. refineries operating in the low 80% range of capacity, and the other half of the nation\u2019s refining capacity outside of the region, there\u2019s likely to be available capacity to tap as needed, says Stewart Glickman, energy equity analyst at CFRA Research. Storms also \u201ctend not to have long-lasting effects on prices,\u201d which generally return to pre-storm levels in a \u201cmatter of weeks.\u201d Though unlikely, if a quick post-hurricane restoration of refinery operations coincides with an acceleration in Covid-19 cases that subdues refined product demand, and refiners maintain or expand the amount of crude they process, gasoline prices would suffer, says Glickman. However, with demand already \u201cabnormally low,\u201d and assuming only short-lived supply disruptions, Robinson says prices may see a \u201cslight increase\u201d in the next few weeks, with no big swings on the horizon. \u201cUntil the surplus of both gasoline and crude oil is consumed and we move closer to a balance of supply and demand, prices will likely remain similar to where they\u2019ve been in recent weeks,\u201d says Robinson."}]}
