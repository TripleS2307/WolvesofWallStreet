Decades ago, it was the most technologically advanced way to share a batch of music. A lineup of songs specially curated by the right person could say \u00e2\u0080\u009cI love you\u00e2\u0080\u009d or bring back memories of a shared experience. Then the technology advanced. Now, with a few clicks, we can make our own electronic mixes any day and for any occasion \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or allow cloud-based virtual assistants to surprise us. Now consider the mutual fund. Decades ago, it was one of the most common ways to invest. For a smallish fee, an ordinary investor could buy into a portfolio of stocks or bonds specially curated by a financial expert. But just as with music, movies, cars, pharmaceuticals, robotics, money and so many other products, investing has evolved. An innovation often called \u00e2\u0080\u009cdirect indexing\u00e2\u0080\u009d is gaining ground with affluent investors, and is likely to soon start to reach the retail masses. If mutual funds were mix tapes and exchange-traded funds were like the deejay machines that made an appearance in mall record stores for a few years, direct indexing is Spotify SPOT, +0.08% \u00c2 or Pandora: personal, technological, disruptive, and even a little sexy. The idea is simple, and it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t new. Big institutional investors like pension funds have long used customized indexes that reflected certain priorities for their portfolios. Rather than investing in the entire S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% \u00c2 , they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll select for large-cap stocks with a value tilt, leaving out tobacco companies, for example. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s changed over time is the thresholds for accessing an index have gotten lower and lower,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dave Nadig, an index industry veteran now serving as chief investment officer and director of research at ETF Database. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a software problem. And the technology required to produce that customized account has plummeted to the point where it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost retail. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not quite mom-and-pop, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heading there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d One of the many companies trying to solve the \u00e2\u0080\u009csoftware problem\u00e2\u0080\u009d is O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Shaughnessy Asset Management. Canvas, O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Shaughnessy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s direct indexing product, is shared with a select few registered investment advisors who can offer it as a service to their clients. For that client, access to Canvas means that rather than holding a bunch of individual securities that may or may not mesh well together, or being at the whim of fund creators who select the securities inside their funds according to their own beliefs, he can create a customized index that makes sense for him, in very specific ways. That could mean starting with the S&P 500, then stripping out the two companies where a husband and wife work and already hold big chunks of the firms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 equity. It may be a broad index of stocks less fossil fuels, or private prisons, or other companies whose missions or practices offend particular sensibilities. Those features were familiar to Canvas\u00e2\u0080\u0099 creators, but Patrick O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Shaughnessy, the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CEO, told MarketWatch that one of the biggest surprises from seeing the program in action \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been in service since November \u00e2\u0080\u0094 had to do with investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 taxes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t anticipate how much effort we would spend customizing tax profiles, setting limits on the capital gains tax a client might be willing to pay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Shaughnessy said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSetting limits\u00e2\u0080\u009d may be putting it mildly. Direct indexing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s secret sauce may be just as much about actively managing tax-loss harvesting for clients as it is about keeping portfolios ESG-friendly. That means that a program like Canvas will watch for stocks that are losing value, and sell them in order to offset capital gains on others that have gained. For many observers, the problems direct indexing aims to solve may sound like nice ones to have. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a uniquely first-world complaint to inherit a substantial stash of the stock of a Fortune 500 company, say, or to have the resources to devote to actively strategizing how to avoid capital gains taxes. But industry participants say direct indexing is just another innovation that starts with early adopters and diffuses its way outward. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTesla TSLA, +1.89% \u00c2 started with the Roadster, and then came the Model X, Model S, and Model 3,\u00e2\u0080\u009d O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Shaughnessy said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe best way to perfect a technology is to attack the hardest use case first. Our customers tend to be very wealthy, ultra-high-net-worth individuals with peculiar tax settings or circumstances: complicated financial lives. Our marginal costs are high enough that we couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do this today for retail investors, but all of these direct solutions will keep pushing down market.\u00e2\u0080\u009d One early sign of that push downstream is a \u00e2\u0080\u009cstock-level tax-loss harvesting\u00e2\u0080\u009d service offered by robo advisor Wealthfront. The service is available for accounts as low as $100,000, and, as a company spokesperson told MarketWatch, the appeal of saving on taxes is a universal: hardly something reserved for the wealthy. But Wealthfront declined to say how many clients were actively using the product. See: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Most people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be called average,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 says Betterment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Dan Egan, who designs financial tools for them anyway Nadig, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s watched \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and helped launch \u00e2\u0080\u0094 multiple rounds of disruption in the fund industry himself, thinks a more interesting player is Charles Schwab Corp. Nadig and many other observers believe the company is moving quietly, but deliberately, toward offering direct indexing broadly, a step that will democratize it. Schwab in June began offering what it calls stock \u00e2\u0080\u009cslices,\u00e2\u0080\u009d fractional shares that will make direct indexing much easier for smaller accounts. For big-ticket portfolios, pricier stocks like, say, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +3.01% \u00c2 , aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a problem. But a $50,000 account that intends to invest in an index of 400 stocks requires fractional shares in order to have a position in a stock that costs $3,000. The company had previously purchased another direct-indexing concern called Motif. And they have the enormous reach to be able to swallow low enough margins to democratize the process, Nadig said in an interview. James Werner, a financial advisor with Austin, Texas-based Silicon Hills Wealth Management, is also carefully watching the advance of direct indexing. Werner estimates about 20% of his firm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clients are using the service, with great success, and notes that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s particularly popular among younger investors. He calls Canvas \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe next generation\u00e2\u0080\u009d of direct indexing capability, and says with a laugh that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe next generation beyond that\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 likely one enabled by Schwab \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is going to replace financial advisors like himself. Related:As boomers hand over the keys to the stock market, sustainability-minded younger investors let their consciences lead But if a bespoke, technology-oriented investing tool is going to put anyone out of a job, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more likely to be portfolio managers, especially those that dominate the index-investing space, sources said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe big loser here is not financial advisers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nadig said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe big loser here is BlackRock or State Street. Their business is taking other people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intellectual property (indexes), packaging it up and distributing them to customers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A player like Schwab \u00e2\u0080\u0094 although, in Nadig\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind, there is no other player like Schwab, which he describes as \u00e2\u0080\u009csoup to nuts from one guy with $100 in a checking account up to hundreds of billions they manage themselves\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is uniquely positioned to integrate indexing, trading, relationships with individual investors around the country, and all the back-end machinations in between. But Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar, thinks calling for the death of the fund industry is premature, if only because of the enormous inertia that surrounds investor decisions. Johnson also believes that the fuss over direct indexing belies a very straightforward reality: \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor all intents and purposes this is just another form of active management.\u00e2\u0080\u009d While a handful of investors will be well-served by the ability to invest according to their conscience or around their family fortunes, most people are better off sticking with a true index \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that is, owning the market outright in a fund like Vanguard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s popular S&P 500 index fund VOO, +0.89% \u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Johnson said in an interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been predicting the end of the brokerage industry for 30 years,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Barry Ritholtz, the co-founder, chairman and chief investment office of Ritholtz Wealth Management, a New York-based investment advisory with $1.5 billion in assets, and a Canvas client. Straightforward indexing \u00e2\u0080\u009cworks for 90% of the people out there. This is more sophisticated and maybe a little intimidating to a lot of people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ritholtz said. In Morningstar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last annual analysis of the performance of passive and active funds, only 23% of all active funds topped the average of their passive rivals over the 10-year period ended June 2019. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another important distinction about direct indexing. For all the discussion about customization, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still centered around the idea that investing needs to start somewhere, to participate in a broad market in some way, even if it gets trimmed or tweaked. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a vastly different proposition than the way many individuals approach investing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 buying a little of this, a little of that, rolling over something from an old account, and so on. And as Ritholtz points out, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s much easier to implement a robust tax-loss harvesting strategy with hundreds of stocks than with a few dozen. Still, as with any disruptive innovation it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to know exactly what the future will bring. James Werner is struck by how his direct-indexing clients behaved through the March market meltdown, bringing a sense of ownership to their portfolios that he thinks was a vastly different experience than previous downturns. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople have much stronger staying power, if they have a connection with the stocks that they own as opposed to just having things in a nebulous exchange-traded fund,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Werner said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn conversation after conversation, people just said, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not worried about that, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll come back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d See:A \u00e2\u0080\u0098Hippocratic oath\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for financial advisers?
