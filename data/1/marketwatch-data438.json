The case before the justices Wednesday has to do with Google\u2019s GOOGL, +1.82% GOOG, +1.97% creation of the Android operating system now used on the vast majority of smartphones worldwide. Google says that to create Android, which was released in 2007, it wrote millions of lines of new computer code. But it also used 11,330 lines of code and an organization that\u2019s part of Oracle\u2019s ORCL, +0.42% Java platform. Google has defended its actions, saying what it did is long-settled, common practice in the industry, a practice that has been good for technical progress. But Oracle says Google \u201ccommitted an egregious act of plagiarism\u201d and sued, seeking more than $8 billion. The case has been going on for a decade. Google won the first round when a trial court rejected Oracle\u2019s copyright claim, but that ruling was overturned on appeal. A jury then sided with Google, calling its copying \u201cfair use,\u201d but an appeals court disagreed. Because of the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, only eight justices are hearing the case, and they\u2019re doing so by phone because of the coronavirus pandemic. The questions for the court are whether the 1976 Copyright Act protects what Google copied, and, even if it does, whether what Google did is still permitted. Oracle, for its part, says the case is simple. \u201cThis case is about theft,\u201d Oracle\u2019s chief Washington lobbyist, Ken Glueck, said in a telephone interview ahead of argument. He compared what Google did to plagiarizing from someone else\u2019s speech. When you plagiarize one line from a speech, he said: \u201cThat\u2019s a plagiarized speech. Nobody says, \u2018Oh, well, it was just one line.\u2019\u201d But Google\u2019s Kent Walker, the company\u2019s chief legal officer, said in an interview that Google wrote \u201cevery line of code we possibly could ourselves.\u201d \u201cNo one\u2019s ever claimed copyright over software interfaces, but that\u2019s what Oracle is claiming now,\u201d Walker said. Microsoft MSFT, +2.48%, IBM IBM, -2.81% and major internet and tech industry lobbying groups have weighed in \u2014 in favor of Google. The Trump administration, the Motion Picture Association and the Recording Industry Association of America are among those supporting Oracle. The case is Google LLC v. Oracle America Inc., 18-956."}]}
