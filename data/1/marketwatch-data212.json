She's asking $3.25 million for the bayfront home. The actress purchased the property in 1998 for $420,000, so her investment has shown some serious appreciation. \"Kim has owned it for a while, and it is time for her to turn the page and simplify a bit,\" says listing agent Rebekah Baker, with Sotheby's International Realty East Hampton Brokerage. \"She has her mom out West, and I think she wants to be closer to her.\" Baker adds that Cattrall's touches are visible throughout. \"She did everything to this property. It is perfectly curated by her with beautiful gardens with tall grasses and bluestone walkways leading up to a home that has dimension and nooks to relax in, and yet it is open to the impressive water views. Decks at the back to view the water and a deck at the front to view the gardens.\" For the inner artist, there's a separate building to channel such inclinations. \"She has an incredible studio in the middle of the property to get away further and pursue creative pursuits like writing the three books she wrote while living here,\" says Baker. The studio could be converted into a home gym or guest quarters. Set behind a gate and overlooking Gardiners Bay, the property offers seclusion and a \"laid-back waterfront lifestyle,\" the listing notes.
