WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that more than half those cases have been reported in the last six weeks and that the virus has \u00e2\u0080\u009cupended health systems in some of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wealthiest nations,\u00e2\u0080\u009d while others of \u00e2\u0080\u009cmodest means\u00e2\u0080\u009d have been more successful. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut in most of the world the virus is not under control,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tedros said at the WHO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weekly update for member states. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is getting worse.\u00e2\u0080\u009d See:Amid pandemic, U.S. officially withdraws from World Health Organization The number of confirmed cases in the U.S. set yet another single-day record on Wednesday of more than 62,000 cases as hospitals in the South and West continued to report rising demand for intensive-care-unit beds. The U.S. how has 3.06 million confirmed cases of the virus, the highest number in the world by a wide margin, and at least 132,310 people have died, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. A full 38 states and regions have seen cases climb over the last 14 days, according to a New York Times tracker, led by West Virginia and Montana as well as the U.S. Virgin Islands. President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s administration is focused on a push for states to reopen schools in the fall, and on Wednesday Trump threatened to cut federal funding for those that refuse. Trump said he disagreed with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery impractical\u00e2\u0080\u009d guidelines on reopening, which call for measures including spacing desks at least 6 feet apart and cleaning frequently touched surfaces. Michael Osterholm, head of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said the U.S. needs to go back to Square 1. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have to shut down again and bring the U.S. back up slowly, in a measured way,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Osterholm said in an interview on MSNBC. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need to understand as a nation that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just in the very earliest stages of this pandemic yet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, reiterating that the virus \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill not rest until it gets to 50% to 70% of the population infected, and only then it will slow down \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it will not stop transmission.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Osterholm has estimated that just 7% of the U.S. population has been infected. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPart of my concern is that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve not convinced much of the U.S. population that this is important and needed to be done,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cgovernors are feeling the pinch\u00e2\u0080\u009d between doing what public health experts recommend and what large portions of their populations prefer. While some states have reversed reopening plans of late, it's highly unlikely that Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s government will advocate a return to lockdown, given the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resistance to the advice of public health experts. Trump criticized Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, on Wednesday after Fauci said the U.S. is still \u00e2\u0080\u009cknee deep in the first wave\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the crisis. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI disagree with him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said in an interview with former Fox News anchor Greta Van Susteren, that is slated to be aired on Sunday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know, Dr. Fauci said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wear masks,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and now he says [to] wear them. And you know, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s said numerous things: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t close off China. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ban China.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And I did it anyway. I sort of didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t listen to my experts, and I banned China.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In the meantime, there are fresh reports of a shortage of testing kits, as well as lab workers to process swabs, and some states say they urgently need more personal protective equipment, or PPE.

We need more medical personnel. We are struggling.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In Oklahoma, a public health official said Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recent indoor rally is likely behind a dramatic surge in new cases of COVID-19, as the Associated Press reported. Tulsa County reported 261 confirmed new cases on Monday, a one-day record high, and another 206 cases were recorded on Tuesday. By comparison, during the week before the Trump rally on June 20, there were 76 cases on Monday and 96 on Tuesday. Tulsa City-County Health Department Director Dr. Bruce Dart said large gatherings, such as the indoor Trump re-election rally that drew thousands (the official attendance figure was 6,200, a bit less than a third of the Tulsa arena\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capacity), were likely to blame. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the past few days, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen almost 500 new cases, and we had several large events just over two weeks ago, so I guess we just connect the dots,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dart said.Latest tallies There are now 12.1 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, and at least 551,271 people have died, the Johns Hopkins data show. At least 6.6 million people have recovered. Brazil is second to the U.S. with 1.71 million cases and 67,964 deaths. India is third measured by cases at 767,296, followed by Russia with 706,240 and Peru with 312,911. The U.K. has 44,687 fatalities, the highest in Europe and third highest in the world. China, where the illness was first reported late last year, has 84,992 cases and 4,641 fatalities.

MRNA, +0.09% announced another manufacturing deal for its still investigational COVID-19 vaccine, as MarketWatch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Jaimy Lee reported. As part of the deal, Laboratorios Farmac\u00c3\u00a9uticos Rovi ROVI, +0.31%, based in Madrid, will handle commercial fill-finish manufacturing of the vaccine candidate for use outside the U.S. The company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vaccine candidate has not yet proven that it can protect against the coronavirus; however, drug makers in the U.S. are moving forward with manufacturing plans, often with the financial support of the U.S. government, to speed up the vaccine-development process. For more, read:Race for a COVID-19 vaccine has drug makers scaling up manufacturing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 before one is developed Moderna has announced several manufacturing deals for its experimental COVID-19 vaccine, including with Catalent Inc. CTLT, +1.90% \u00c2 and CordenPharma. Gilead Sciences Inc. GILD, +0.82%, meanwhile, started a Phase 1a clinical study testing an inhaled version of its experimental COVID-19 drug remdesivir. The Food and Drug Administration in May granted an emergency-use authorization to an intravenous form of remdesivir as a treatment for some severely ill COVID-19 patients. Gilead first announced plans in June for the new randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, which has enrolled 60 healthy adults. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDelivering remdesivir directly to the primary site of infection with a nebulized, inhaled solution may enable more targeted and accessible administration in nonhospitalized patients and potentially lower systemic exposure to the drug,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Merdad Parsey, Gilead\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief medical officer, said in a statement.

The number of initial jobless claims fell by almost 100,000 in early July to a four-month low of 1.31 million, but the pace of layoffs is still quite high and appears to be bogging down an economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, as MarketWatch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Jeffry Bartash reported. Initial jobless claims, a rough gauge of layoffs, dropped to 1.31 million in the seven days ended July 4 from a revised 1.41 million in the prior week, the Labor Department said Thursday. The figures are seasonally adjusted. See now:MarketWatch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Coronavirus Recovery Tracker Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast 1.4 million new claims. These figures reflect applications filed the normal way through state unemployment offices. An additional 1.04 million people applied for benefits last week through a temporary federal-relief program, pushing the combined total for the week to 2.35 million. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFilings remain high and are declining at a stubbornly slow pace. We could see upward pressure in coming weeks in response to a surge in virus cases and related closures of businesses,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics.What are companies saying? Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. WBA, -1.96% reported third-quarter earnings that missed estimates and booked a $2 billion impairment from COVID-19 on its U.K. business.

Same-store sales rose 12%, including an 11% increase in U.S. same-store sales. E-commerce sales increased 86%, the company said. Costco sales in May rose 7.5%, and online sales jumped 106% that month. Costco has reported strong e-commerce sales this year, but in its last quarterly report in April the company said online sales hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t made up for the drop in foot traffic at stores and other businesses such as optical, food court and travel due to stay-at-home orders, social-distancing restrictions and closures related to the pandemic.

The company ended the quarter with $88.5 million in cash, and short- and long-term debt of $324.9 million. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Noble Energy Inc.

The Houston-based oil and natural-gas exploration and development company delivered 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day (MBoe/d) in the quarter, including 248 MBoe/d from U.S. onshore. The company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cost-cutting measures delivered record-low unit production costs of $6.61 per BOE. It reduced general and administrative costs to $63 million, down 40% from the same period a year ago. Despite the significant impact on global economies from COVID-19, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve materially reduced the cost structure of our business, while demonstrating robust production capacity in both our onshore and offshore businesses,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Chief Executive David Stover said in a statement. Noble will report second-quarter earnings on Aug. 7. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Sur La Table has filed for bankruptcy and arranged for an eventual sale, the privately held cookware retailer said.
