The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% surged 378.13 points, or 1.4%, to end at 28,308.46, finishing above 28,000 for the first time in six months and only 4.2% away from its Feb. 12 record closing high. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% gained 34.12 points, or 1%, closing at a record 3,431.28, near its fresh intraday record. The Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39% rose 67.92 points, or 0.6%, ending at a record 11,379.72, following its intraday all-time high at 11,462,05. The S&P 500 on Friday drifted higher by 0.3% in light volume to end at a record 3,397.16, marking a 0.7% weekly advance.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite logged a 2.7% weekly rise, finishing Friday at 11,311.80, its 36th record finish of 2020.What drove the market? Equity investors snapped up a broad range of U.S. stocks on Monday, from airlines to technology darlings, a day after the Food and Drug Administration said it approved the use of convalescent plasma, the antibody-rich component of blood taken from recovered COVID-19 patients, as a treatment for serious coronavirus cases. \u201cIt does seem to be related to potentially favorable news over the weekend regarding treatments, and general optimism about the possibility of a coronavirus vaccine,\u201d John Carey, Amundi Pioneer\u2019s director of U.S. equity Income, told MarketWatch. \u201cIt\u2019s a broader-based market advance, with both cyclicals and growth stocks moving upward.\u201d The World Health Organization on Monday warned that the plasma therapy hailed by President Donald Trump Sunday still is unproven and cautioned that the there is \u201cvery low evidence\u201d that it is safe and effective. Medical experts said the potential plasma treatment may provide benefits to those battling the disease, while questions remain about when it should be administered and dosage. AstraZeneca AZN, +0.63% AZN, +1.16% shares rose 1.9%, even after the drugmaker denied talks with U.S. government about emergency use authorization of its coronavirus vaccine, a day after the Financial Times reported that Trump may order the FDA to grant the same type of approval for its vaccine, which is being developed by University of Oxford researchers. The new bout of optimism helped beaten-down cyclical sectors, including shares of energy and industrials, areas that would benefit from a faster economic rebound. Energy shares led gains on the Nasdaq and S&P 500 Monday. \u201cThere is a rationale for some of these cyclical stocks to do better on the hopes or expectations of vaccines being developed. But I do think it\u2019s still a bumpy road\u201d for the economic recovery, said Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment strategist at BMO Wealth Management, in an interview. Read:Are stock market investors overpricing or underpricing a coronavirus vaccine? The S&P 500 returned to record territory last week, erasing a nearly 34% plunge that took the U.S. benchmark from a record Feb. 19 close to its March 23 low, in a rally driven largely by shares of big tech companies that have seen their businesses benefit from the pandemic, while shares of companies whose performance is tied more closely to the economic cycle have continued to lag despite some recent stretches of outperformance.

The event, typically held in Jackson Hole, Wyo., will be conducted via webcast this year. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is slated to speak Thursday on how the central bank plans to achieve its twin goals of stable prices and maximum employment once the coronavirus pandemic has ended. \u201cI believe Powell may go so far as to announce a new inflation targeting policy, or at least hint at it,\u201d wrote Kristina Hooper, Invesco\u2019s chief global market strategist, in a note Monday. \u201cWe could also hear central bankers from around the world discuss how they would respond monetarily to trade policy, which I believe is worth addressing given the current state of trade tensions.\u201d In economic data, the Chicago Fed\u2019s national activity index fell to 1.18 in July from a revised record-high of 5.33 in June.
