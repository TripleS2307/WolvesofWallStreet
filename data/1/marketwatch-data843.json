So why are you scared of running out of money?", "body": "All of us have a history with money. We grow up with too little or too much \u2014 or fall under the sway of parents or others who influence our attitude about saving and spending. As we age, money often becomes an indicator of our emotional well-being. It\u2019s fine to think about money frequently, enjoying its benefits and squeezing value from it. But it\u2019s not healthy to fret about it constantly and let the \u201cI-don\u2019t-have-enough\u201d worry eat away at you. Even some rich people express irrational fear of going penniless. In an honest moment, a financial adviser will admit that chronic worrywarts are high-maintenance clients. They require more hand-holding. What\u2019s worse, they may not listen to reason. A little empathy goes a long way. Rather than dread these clients, savvy advisers ask gentle questions in an effort to uncover deeper concerns, motivations and memories. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say the fear of never having enough money is irrational,\u201d said Jim Ludwick, a certified financial planner in Las Vegas. \u201cMost of the time, it\u2019s because some friend or relative experienced adverse things and the client observed it up close. Their experience colors looking at their assets and liabilities objectively.\u201d When clients tell Ludwick that they\u2019re scared of running out of money, he starts by listening without interrupting. Then he repeats back what he heard to confirm understanding. From there, he asks questions such as, \u201cWhy are you raising this now?\u201d \u201cI try to understand the real source of their concern so that I can identify what\u2019s triggering it,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to find out where their anxiety is coming from.\u201d When wealthy clients insist that they might lose it all \u2014 or they\u2019re beset by fear that their nest egg is too small \u2014 an adviser\u2019s sensible appeal to data can backfire. All the facts and figures in the world can fall by the wayside if someone is unwilling to digest them. To allay such fears, Steve Jablonski takes a less-is-more approach. Rather than list all the reasons why a client is set for life financially, he will make his case succinctly. \u201cWe keep it as simple as we can,\u201d said Jablonski, a certified financial planner in Norristown, Pa. \u201cWe want to deliver it in a way the client can understand.\u201d Early in his career, Jablonski worked for a firm that produced a 125-page book to educate clients about their holdings. He recalls that about 75% of the material was boilerplate content that had nothing to do with the client. He soon abandoned that strategy in favor of teaming up with clients to customize their financial plan. \u201cWe build it together,\u201d he said. \u201cThe client gets a three-page printout,\u201d which tends to hit home and tamp down money worries. For some fretful clients, realizing that their adviser is making highly conservative assumptions can in itself offer some relief. They\u2019re less apt to worry if they see that their adviser has considered worst-case outcomes and factored them into the plan. When Tony Zabiegala, an adviser in Independence, Ohio, works with anxious clients, he compares the assumptions he\u2019s making with numbers often used in financial planning software. \u201cI\u2019ll tell clients the software assumes 7% rate of return and we use 5%,\u201d he said. \u201cOr it might assume you\u2019ll live to 85. We use 95.\u201d Some clients need some perspective to reduce their fear. Anxious about never having enough money, they may not realize that they\u2019re hardly alone in their state of distress. Bjorn Amundson, a Minneapolis-based certified financial planner, cites research in which wealthy people were asked, \u201cAt what point would you feel comfortable with the amount of money you have?\u201d Respondents with $5 million and even $10 million said they felt they needed more money to be comfortable. \u201cThere seems to be a psychological thing going on where you\u2019ll never feel comfortable until you have something like $200 million in the bank,\u201d Amundson said. \u201cThat may not be rational, but it\u2019s totally human to be afraid of things regardless of what the odds are.\u201d By sharing this with clients, Amundson assures them that they\u2019re not alone in feeling antsy about not having enough. Once they see that their fear is normal, they\u2019re able to focus on the facts and view their situation with more clarity and logic.
