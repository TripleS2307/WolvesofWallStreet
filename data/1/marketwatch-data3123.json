The president\u2019s statements spurred TikTok to make additional concessions, including agreeing to add as many as 10,000 jobs in the U.S. over the next three years, but it isn\u2019t clear if those will alter Trump\u2019s stance, one of the people said. The software giant MSFT, +2.48% was in advanced talks with TikTok parent Bytedance Ltd., with momentum toward a deal that they believed met the White House goal for the popular app to get bought by a U.S. company, the people said. Those plans were interrupted when Trump told reporters on Air Force One that he preferred to ban the app and wouldn\u2019t support a sale. Before Trump\u2019s remarks, the two sides believed the broad strokes of a deal could be in place by Monday, the people said. The companies were caught off guard by the president\u2019s comments, said one person familiar with the matter. Another person said the White House has been involved in the discussions for weeks and made it clear from the outset that the desired outcome was for TikTok to be \u201cAmerican owned.\u201d In a statement Saturday, a White House spokesperson said, \u201cThe administration has very serious national security concerns over TikTok. We continue to evaluate future policy.\u201d The deal talks aren\u2019t believed to be dead, but rather the two companies are trying to get clarity on where the White House stands and whether it is planning a separate action that would make it difficult for TikTok to operate in the U.S., the people said. Trump said that he preferred to ban the app entirely. \u201cAs far as TikTok is concerned we\u2019re banning them from the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, I have that authority.\u201d See also: Microsoft in advanced talks to buy TikTok\u2019s US business An expanded version of this story appears on WSJ.com"}]}
