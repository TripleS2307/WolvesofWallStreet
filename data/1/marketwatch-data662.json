Kicking off at 9 p.m. Eastern from the battleground state of Ohio, the debate will be moderated by \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d anchor Chris Wallace. Announced topics include the coronavirus pandemic, the economy and racial justice. The candidates\u2019 taxes will almost certainly come up also, after a New York Times report Sunday showed Trump paid just $750 in federal income taxes the year he ran for office, and none in several other years. Trump has disputed the report. Biden released his 2019 tax returns hours ahead of the debate. Key tickers: S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% U.S. dollar DXY, -0.58% 10-year Treasury TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.777%."}]}
