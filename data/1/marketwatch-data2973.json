(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) Alex Wong/Getty Images President Donald Trump is considering extending the pandemic-related pause on student-loan collections and payments Thursday, just days after Senate Republicans released a stimulus bill that would allow these activities to resume on Oct. 1. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe also suspended student-loan payments for six months,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump told reporters Thursday, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking to do that additionally, and for additional periods of time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In March, Trump used his executive authority during a national emergency to waive interest on federal student loans. Later that month, Congress passed the CARES Act, which paused payments and collections on federal student loans and set their interest rate to 0% for six months. If the government doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take action, the CARES Act pause will end on Sept. 30 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 about a month before the presidential election \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and payments and collections on student loans will resume. Consumer advocates have worried that given the continued economic downturn, borrowers aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ready to resume making payments. In addition, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve warned that the student-loan system isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ready for the likely flood of requests borrowers will be making to their student-loan companies to move to more affordable repayment plans.\u00c2 Advocates criticize Republicans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 stimulus proposal The stimulus bill Senate Republicans released Monday, titled the HEALS Act, includes provisions that would cut down on the number of student-loan repayment plans available permanently, with the goal of streamlining the system. As part of the plan, borrowers who aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t making any money wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to make student-loan payments, an option that is already available to federal student-loan borrowers under the current system.\u00c2 Borrower advocates criticized the bill, saying it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t provide the relief borrowers need during this time, and that in some ways, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worse than what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already available.\u00c2 A group of 56 consumer-advocacy groups wrote to Senate leaders this week calling on lawmakers to extend the CARES Act payment pause for at least one year. They also asked Congress to expand eligibility for the payment pause to include borrowers who graduated in 2020 and the estimated 9 million borrowers with certain types of federal student loans who were left out of the initial CARES Act payment pause.\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cGiven that the current health and economic crisis has no end in sight, Congress should provide real relief for student borrowers and work to strengthen borrower protections, not roll them back,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the letter reads.\u00c2 Democrats released their own proposal in May The HEROES Act, the stimulus bill passed by the Democratic-led House of Representatives in May, included a provision to cancel $10,000 in student debt for economically distressed borrowers and extended the CARES Act payment pause until Sept. 30, 2021.\u00c2 At the time, some borrower advocates criticized the debt-cancellation provision, arguing that it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go far enough. In their letter, advocates reiterated their call for student-debt forgiveness to be included in a coronavirus relief package.\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cAny modification should be paired with retroactive action cancelling loan balances and freeing capital for millions of people being held back by their student loan debts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they wrote.\u00c2 Momentum has been building over the past few years to broadly cancel student debt as a way to boost the economy and narrow the racial wealth gap, among other goals. Both Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, proposed broadly canceling student debt as part of their presidential campaigns. Warren repeated that call in a July New York Times op-ed outlining her priorities for coronavirus relief.\u00c2 Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, has endorsed the idea of offering up to $10,000 in student-debt cancellation per borrower."}]}
