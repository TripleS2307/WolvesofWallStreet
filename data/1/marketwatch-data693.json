The offer applies to Value Fare bookings and allows travelers to take a friend or family member along on the same flight free. But consumers will have to be quick. The offer, which expires at midnight on Sept. 24, applies on 1,600 routes across Ryanair RYA, -2.60% \u00e2\u0080\u0098s network and will be valid from Sept. 25. until Dec. 14. 2020. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor the first time in Ryanair RYAAY, -2.08% history, we have a \u00e2\u0080\u009cBuy One, Get One Free\u00e2\u0080\u009d offer landing. Anyone would be crazy to miss it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alejandra Ruiz, Ryanair\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head of communications. The move comes as Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Leary said Britain risks losing hundreds of thousands of travel and tourism jobs in the coming months, unless the government offers support to workers and eases travel restrictions. His comments come ahead of a plan by the European Union plan aimed at clearing up the confusion of coronavirus restrictions on travelers across Europe. Airlines around the world have been forced to cancel flights over the past few months because of changes in travel restrictions. Ryanair last week blamed European governments for \u00e2\u0080\u009ccontinuous changes\u00e2\u0080\u009d in travel restrictions, as it announced a 20% cut in October capacity.

We think for both Ryanair and the European aviation sector the possibility of further travel restrictions is an overhang,\u00e2\u0080\u009d analysts at UBS wrote in a research note on Wednesday. On Sept. 4, the European Commission identified four key areas for improving cross-border coordination, including the development of common quarantine rules and a shared \u00e2\u0080\u0098color-coding\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of higher-risk areas. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe decision as to whether to introduce restrictions to free movement remains the responsibility of the Member States, which have to act in compliance with Union law. Equally, Member States retain the flexibility not to introduce restrictions even if the criteria and thresholds outlined in this Recommendation are met,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Commission\u00e2\u0080\u0099s briefing paper stated. Several EU countries have imposed new coronavirus restrictions in recent days amid a surge in virus cases. The World Health Organization warned on Sept. 18 of \u00e2\u0080\u009calarming\u00e2\u0080\u009d transmission rates of COVID-19 in Europe. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to get tougher. In October, November, we are going to see more mortality,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said WHO Europe director Hans Kluge."}]}
