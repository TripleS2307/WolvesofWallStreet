What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on?", "body": "Is 2020 the year ESG came of age? Flows into investment products with an environmental, social, or governance focus \u00e2\u0080\u0094 also sometimes called sustainable investments \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are topping earlier records, gathering over $15 billion in just the first six months of the year, according to research provider ETF Flows. Investors have long expressed interest in ESG products, but rarely put their money where their mouths were, noted Dave Nadig, a longtime veteran of the exchange-traded fund industry now serving as ETF Flows\u00e2\u0080\u0099 chief investment officer and director of research. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe dam has broken. This is the year it came out of the backroom and became a reality.\u00e2\u0080\u009d On Tuesday, investment titan BlackRock also said that sustainable ETFs in its iShares suite had gathered $11 billion so far in 2020, more than doubling the $5 billion of inflows in the full year 2019.

Senra also believes that the worldwide coronavirus pandemic helped accelerate the pivot. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been an increased interest in companies that can better manage social issues: how they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re treating their employees, working with communities, and so on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The experience has also helped financial services firms make the case that sustainably-managed companies are also better investment prospects, he said. ETF Flows\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Nadig thinks there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a more straightforward explanation. Investors have indeed been interested in sustainable strategies for years, but after a decade-long bull market, most were reluctant to take the capital gains impact that would come with transitioning their portfolios. The market carnage of March provided the perfect opportunity to rotate, Nadig noted. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more, the ESG category is also getting a performance boost this year. By design, it largely excludes energy and industrial stocks, both of which have lagged the technology and consumer-oriented post-pandemic economy.

Still, he said, for investors across the spectrum, the demand seems real: flows into ESG-themed products have consistently made up a solid chunk of all investment dollars every month in 2020. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis time really is different,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nadig said.
