While early hot spots, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, are showing clear progress in containing the spread of the illness, other states, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina, Nevada, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Utah are all seeing increases in infections. In total, 23 states are showing a rise in cases, according to a New York Times tracker, while 10 are showing rates pretty much the same and the rest are recording a decrease in new infections. \u201cThis is not a second wave, this is another swell that is part of the \u201cfirst wave\u201d of this virus,\u201d said Raymond James analysts in a note clients. \u201cWe remain skeptical nationwide or statewide shutdowns will be implemented again before the elections; however, some states may choose to halt advances in the next phases of reopenings, and some county or city leaders may attempt to shut things down again.\u201d Utah and Oregon put their plans to continue reopening on hold on Saturday, but Texas, Arkansas and Arizona are pushing ahead despite their red flags, the Associated Press reported. Texas hit highs in the past week for hospitalizations and new COVID-19 cases, prompting Houston\u2019s top county official, Lina Hidalgo, to warn that \u201cwe may be approaching the precipice of a disaster.\u201d Yet the Lone Star state went ahead with allowing restaurants to expand eat-in dining Friday to 75% of capacity, up from 50%, said the AP. \u201cCompared to Sunday last week, the seven-day average number of new cases is up 97% in Alabama, 27% in Arizona, 42% in Arkansas, 50% in Florida, 31% in Louisiana, 27% in Mississippi, 44% in Nevada, 50% in Oregon, 23% in North Carolina, and 86% in South Carolina, a state which seems to think that testing is unpatriotic,\u201d said Pantheon Macroeconomics chief economist Ian Shepherdson in a note. See:The surge in coronavirus cases in some states isn\u2019t part of a \u2018second wave\u2019 Meanwhile, health experts cautioned that President Donald Trump\u2019s plan to rally supporters at an event in Tulsa, Oklahoma on Saturday risks spreading infection among the crowd and causing outbreaks when they return to their homes, according to a separate AP report. The Trump campaign has acknowledged that risk by insisting that those who attend sign legal waivers absolving Trump and his staff of any blame, if people get sick or are injured. The plan is to hold the rally indoors in a 19,000-seat arena, that has canceled all other events through the end of July. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released its guidelines for reopening safely on Friday, and identified the highest risk of spreading the virus as stemming from: \u201clarge in-person gatherings where it is difficult for individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and attendees travel from outside the local area.\u201d See:Considerations for Daily Life and Considerations for Events and Gatherings Trump\u2019s rallies tend to involve attendees queuing outside for hours before going through security and into arenas, where they cheer, shout and chant, all risk factors for spreading the droplets that contain the virus.

Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, +2.20% has enrolled the first patient in a late-stage trial assessing rheumatoid arthritis drug Olumiant as a treatment for COVID-19. Olumiant, which was developed by Incyte Corp. INCY, +3.19% and is licensed by Lilly, generated $426.9 million in revenue for Lilly in 2019.

The National Institutes of Health is also conducting a trial evaluating Olumiant in combination with Gilead Sciences Inc.\u2019s GILD, +0.82% remdesivir. See:A new batch of data for Gilead Sciences\u2019 remdesivir points to efficacy but it\u2019s no \u2018silver bullet\u2019 From Europe comes the news that the German government has taken a stake in privately held biotech group CureVac, the company it accused the U.S. of trying to lure away as the pandemic was starting to spread in Europe and the U.S. earlier this year.

KG, jointly announced the government would invest \u20ac300 million ($337 million) in CureVac, the company announced on its website. Funds will partly be used to further develop the company\u2019s drug pipeline, including its COVID-19 vaccine. Under the agreement, the government will end up with a 23% stake in CureVac via a public finance agency. Read:Why virus stocks are driving market volatility In mid-March, a political storm broke out over a report in German newspaper Welt am Sonntag, which claimed the administration of President Donald Trump was trying to secure CureVac\u2019s vaccine exclusively for the U.S., via a large financial donation. The company denied at the time the U.S. had made any sort of takeover bid, while the U.S. ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell said that a German newspaper report was incorrect, Reuters reported. Relocating CureVac to the U.S. would have put the company outside Germany\u2019s jurisdiction. Altmaier said the government\u2019s investment in CureVac to help accelerate development programs, and to help it gain more independence when it comes to vaccines, something many countries are aiming for. \u201cThis is also of high importance for industrial policy as we in Germany and Europe need these essential research results and technologies. At the same time, today\u2019s move is a first and important implementation of the comprehensive Corona Economic Stimulus and Future Technologies Package,\u201d agreed by the government on June 3, said Altmaier.What are companies saying?

Bankrupt car rental company Hertz HTZ, -1.78% filed for the sale of up to $500 million of common stock, after it got permission to do so from a bankruptcy court. In the regulatory filing announcing the offering, the company warned that because it\u2019s bankrupt, the stock could be rendered \u201cworthless.\u201d Experts agree. CreditSights analysts said Friday the mooted deal is a \u201chead scratcher,\u201d given the company is in chapter 11 with unsecured bonds that are trading at very steep discount. \u201cUnless a genie or a lamp showed up the collateral pool, we expect the eventual equity value will be zero,\u201d the CreditSights analysts said.

The company is not providing quarterly or full-year financial guidance given the uncertainty related to the pandemic, but is offering monthly sales updates. \u2022 Chuy\u2019s Holdings Inc.

That compares with earlier guidance for a sizeable second-quarter non-GAAP loss from operations. The company expects the second half will be better than the first, but still expects lower 2020 annual revenue versus 2019 given the uncertainty relating to the pandemic. iRobot will report second-quarter earnings in late July. \u2022 United Airlines Holdings Inc. UAL, +0.32% expects to have about $17 billion in available liquidity by September as it works to combat the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on its financials.
