The Hut Group, which will trade under the stock market ticker THG, helps sell retail brands, including Lookfantastic, skin care group ESPA, and sports nutrition player Myprotein.com. It sold 376 million shares at 500 pence each to raise \u00c2\u00a31.88 billion pounds, valuing the company at \u00c2\u00a35.4 billion ($7 billion). The stock market debut nets The Hut Group \u00c2\u00a3920 million ($1.2 billion) that will be used to pay down the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s debt, which has risen sharply in recent years. Net debt increased to \u00c2\u00a3514 million at the end of 2019 from \u00c2\u00a3294 million at the end of 2018, according to CMC Markets. Shareholders, led by founder Matthew Moulding, will share gross proceeds of \u00c2\u00a3961 million ($1.24 billion). \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am delighted that THG has received such strong support from some of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest investors, which means we have been able to achieve a highly successful offer of shares in the company,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Chief Executive Matthew Moulding. Shares in THG were trading close to 30% up at 645 pence in early morning London trading. The IPO will provide a welcome boost to the European market for new listings, which has seen a slump in volumes during the coronavirus pandemic. It is the largest ever tech IPO in London based on market capitalization at listing, and the second largest tech IPO by capital raised, after Worldpay raised \u00c2\u00a32.5 billion in October 2015. Tech is now the fourth largest sector on the LSE, representing around 11% of the total market capitalization of London-listed companies, almost quadrupling in size over the last five years. Read:A new breed of tech IPOs may give the stock market reason to party like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 1999 THG, which is based in Manchester, has come under scrutiny from investors who have raised concerns over the structure of the deal, which sees Moulding continuing as both chairman and chief executive of the company and retaining control via a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfounder share\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 meaning he will retain control for three years. The company says this will help guard against potential hostile takeover bids in the future. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is intended to permit the holder to deter an unwelcome acquisition of the Company that would not, in the holder\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opinion, deliver sufficient value,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the IPO prospectus states. The structure means that THG won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be eligible for a premium listing and won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to join the FTSE 100, despite being big enough for the blue-chip index of leading shares. Under an unusual incentive scheme, Moulding, who founded the company in 2004, could also be in line to receive bonus payouts of as much as \u00c2\u00a3700 million if THG\u00e2\u0080\u0099s market value reaches \u00c2\u00a37.25 billion within three years. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said that while the IPO might say more about how dormant the U.K. market has been in recent years than it does about The Hut Group, it still reflects strong appetite for the story, with lots of fund managers \u00e2\u0080\u009cclamoring to get a piece of the action\u00e2\u0080\u009d at the 500p issue price. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMuch of the excitement around the stock surrounds its Ingenuity e-commerce fulfillment platform. In the same way Ocado\u00e2\u0080\u0099s online groceries solution is sold to third party supermarkets \u00e2\u0080\u0094 The Hut is signing up the likes of Nestl\u00c3\u00a9 NESN, +0.36% and Procter & Gamble PG, +0.89% \u00c2 to Ingenuity and this is seen as the big growth opportunity for the business,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mould said. THG currently employs 7,000 people and has to grow to 10,000 in next few years. The company has risen from a company with \u00c2\u00a31 million of revenue in 2004 to more than \u00c2\u00a31.1 billion in 2019. BlackRock, Henderson Global Investors, Merian and the Qatar Investment Authority agreed to buy \u00c2\u00a3565 million of the shares offered. KKR, the private equity group that became a shareholder in THG in 2014, sold its entire holding worth \u00c2\u00a3448 million. JPMorgan, Citi, Barclays and Goldman Sachs acted as global coordinators on the flotation, while HSBC, Jefferies and Numis were mandates as joint bookrunners."}]}
