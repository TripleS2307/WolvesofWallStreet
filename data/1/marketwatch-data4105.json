Ives also set a new \"bull-case\" target of $700. \"While the soft macro and COVID backdrop are weighing on near-term consumer demand trends, Apple has a 'once in a decade' opportunity over the next 12 to 18 months,\" Ives wrote in his note to clients, as about 350 million of the 950 million iPhones worldwide are ripe for upgrades. \"China remains a key ingredient in Apple's recipe for success as we estimate roughly 20% of iPhone upgrades will be coming from this region over the coming year.\" Ives points to recent signs of momentum in China, which he expects will continue for the next six to nine months. \"We maintain our outperform rating with Apple being our favorite name to play the 5G theme and strongly believe a further re-rating of Apple's stock is on the horizon,\" Ives wrote, given the \"transformational\" iPhone upgrade cycle ahead. The stock has risen 57% over the past three months as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% has added 13%."}]}
