The president reportedly requested that physicians and other staff at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center sign nondisclosure agreements when he made an unscheduled visit to the hospital in November 2019, NBC News reported, citing unnamed sources. Two doctors who declined to sign the agreements were reportedly barred from being involved in Trump\u2019s care. It wasn\u2019t clear whether Trump made a similar request of any of the Walter Reed staff involved in his care after he was diagnosed with COVID-19 last week, NBC News noted. President Trump has used nondisclosure agreements in the past. In 2018, Trump directed his then-lawyer Michael Cohen to seek a restraining order against adult film actress Stormy Daniels after she violated the terms of a nondisclosure agreement that sought to prevent her from talking about their alleged affair, people familiar with the event told The Wall Street Journal. In 2017, Cohen paid $130,000 to Stormy Daniels \u2014 whose real name is Stephanie Clifford \u2014 as part of that nondisclosure agreement, The Wall Street Journal reported. \u201c Breaching an NDA can lead to getting fired if it\u2019s part of an employer\u2019s contract. And in rarer cases, it can result in jail time. \u201d Daniels subsequently filed a lawsuit arguing that the settlement was invalid because \u201cDavid Dennison,\u201d allegedly the alias used for Trump, never signed it. Daniels used the pseudonym \u201cPeggy Peterson.\u201d The lawsuit was dismissed because the agreement was ruled to be unenforceable, and a California judge ordered Trump to pay Daniels more than $44,000 to cover her legal fees related to the case. Following leaks at the beginning of his presidency, Trump reportedly asked senior White House staff to sign nondisclosure agreements or NDAs, according to a report from Washington Post columnist Ruth Marcus. Unnamed sources told Marcus that the agreements were designed to last beyond Trump\u2019s presidency and carried steep financial penalties if broken. Others have previously suggested that some of these agreements may be both unenforceable and unconstitutional. As federal employees, White House workers are protected by the First Amendment and cannot be silenced on criminal activity they observe. But before Trump\u2019s use of nondisclosure agreements came into the spotlight, a number of women claimed that they had signed confidentiality agreements as part of settlements made with disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein. And Olympic gold medalist McKayla Maroney signed one as part of a settlement following sexual abuse by USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar, who was sentenced to up to 175 years for his crimes. Here is what employees need to know about nondisclosure agreements:What are nondisclosure agreements and how do they work? These sorts of agreements can go by many names, said Donna Ballman, an employment lawyer and author of the book \u201cStand Up For Yourself Without Getting Fired.\u201d \u201cNondisclosure, hush, confidentiality \u2014 no matter what you call it, they are probably the same thing,\u201d Ballman said. The agreements generally bar one or more parties from disclosing the terms of a settlement. Generally, they will describe what information a person can and cannot discuss publicly, and over what period of time the agreement is valid. In some cases, hush agreements will include non-disparagement clauses that bar someone from saying negative things about the other people who formed the agreement, Ballman said. While many recent examples in the news have involved instances of sexual harassment or assault, the agreements can be used for a variety of settlements. Ballman said consumers were most likely to encounter them in product liability settlements or as part of severance packages. Start-ups and inventors may use these agreements to prevent them from revealing proprietary information, while researchers may employ them among participants in studies. Public figures may use them for domestic staff, including housekeepers and even babysitters.What happens when you break a nondisclosure agreement? Stormy Daniels may have sought to have her hush agreement with Trump thrown out so she could tell her story, but experts suggest that approach might not be particularly fruitful for the average person. \u201cThat is rarely considered a real defense because most employers will quickly produce a signed copy,\u201d Ballman said. \u201cBut if there was a breach on the other side, that may well mean she\u2019s no longer obligated to comply.\u201d First and foremost, breaking one of these agreements often has financial implications \u2014 and many agreements will have specific \u201cliquidated damages\u201d clauses, Ballman said. If someone entered into an NDA as part of a settlement, the affected party could sue to get the money back and possibly for additional damages. Daniels, her lawyer told CNN, was allegedly threatened with a $1 million fine for every public appearance in relation to the alleged affair. In some states, violating a confidentiality agreement means the non-breaching party no longer has to follow the agreement\u2019s directives. Breaching an NDA can lead to getting fired if it\u2019s part of an employer\u2019s contract. And in rarer cases, it can result in jail time if a court finds that the breach constituted theft of proprietary information.Should I avoid signing a nondisclosure agreement? The Weinstein scandal prompted many to question the use of nondisclosure agreements, particularly in the context of sexual harassment. Consumers should be aware of their rights before signing such agreements. The National Labor Relations Board believes that non-disparagement provisions that prohibit employees from criticizing a company\u2019s executives publicly are an unfair labor practice. And federal civil rights law supersedes settlements that seek to prevent someone from filing sexual harassment charges, which means you may still be able to file a sexual harassment lawsuit even if you\u2019ve signed an NDA. Ultimately, someone considering signing an NDA should seek legal counsel. They should also carefully weigh what information would have to remain confidential under such an agreement and what effects that could have. \u201cContrary to NDAs that permit parties to do business together or protect proprietary rights, NDAs that hide harassment withhold crucial information from the profession and the public,\u201d Annie Hill, an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota, wrote regarding the Weinstein allegations.
