OPEC said better-than-expected data in the developed nations that make up the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development would serve to ease the drop and ore than offset a downward revision to non-OECD demand. In 2021, OPEC expects oil demand to partially recover from this year's drop, rising by 7 million barrels a day."}]}
