AstraZeneca's stock was up 0.9% in premarket trading on Thursday. The New York Times first reported the diagnosis of transverse myelitis, which has not been confirmed by AstraZeneca; however, the company has confirmed it halted the trial due to a \"potentially unexplained illness.\" Abrahams wrote in a note on Tuesday to investors that instances of vaccine-related transverse myelitis are rare, though there are 119 cases recognized by the Food and Drug Administration between 1985 and 2017. \"It makes sense that the [adverse event] will be fully investigated prior to continuation of vaccine administration,\" he wrote. \"It also highlights the importance of following volunteers for weeks to months post-dosing, as if this side effect were actually related to this or other COVID-19 vaccinations.\" Shares of AstraZeneca, which is developing the vaccine with the University of Oxford, are up 7.6% so far this year. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% has gained 5.2%."}]}
