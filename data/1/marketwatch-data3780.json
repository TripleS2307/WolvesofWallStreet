The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for three decades also took aim and lawmakers and young people: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re propagating the pandemic.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Trump administration is trying to block $25 billion for states to conduct testing and contact tracing in the next coronavirus relief bill, people involved in the talks told the Washington Post on Saturday. Wait times vary from a matter of hours to up to 26 days in some extreme cases. Quest Diagnostics Inc. DGX, +0.33% \u00c2 one of the largest labs in the U.S. performing coronavirus tests, said that the average turnaround time for non-priority patients is \u00e2\u0080\u009cseven or more days\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cslightly more than one day\u00e2\u0080\u009d for priority patients. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will not be in a position to reduce our turnaround times as long as cases of COVID-19 continue to increase dramatically across much of the United States,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the company told MarketWatch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is not just a Quest issue. The surge in COVID-19 cases affects the laboratory industry as a whole.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In an hour-long interview with Mark Zuckerberg on Facebook Live FB, +0.26% on Thursday, Fauci said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen you looked at what happened in European counties, when they had their peak, they locked down.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI say OK, time out. Everybody regroup.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have got to do it correctly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t jump over steps, which is very perilous when you think about rebound. The proof of the pudding is. Look what has happened. There really is no reason that we are having 40,000, 50,000, 60,000, other than we are not doing something correctly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Fauci recently said that the U.S. government had not been doing well with contact tracing, the process of tracing people who have been in contact with someone identified to have the virus, instructing them to stay home, and connecting them with the resources they need to do so. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing very well, for a number of reasons, and not all of which is the fault of the system,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said in an interview last month with CNN T, -1.01%. Fauci previously said the virus may be mutating to become more transmissible. Young people should not be sanguine, Fauci warned, particularly those who are hit badly and/or require hospitalization. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to take months to a year or more to determine if there are any long-lasting, deleterious consequences of the infection,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said on the Facebook Live. As of Sunday, COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, had infected at least 14.5 million people globally and 3.8 million in the U.S. It had killed over 606,206 people worldwide and at least 140,534 in the U.S., according to Johns Hopkins University. Florida reported 12,478 new cases on Sunday. Texas reported over 10,000 new cases for the fifth consecutive day. The day before, the U.S. recorded over 70,000 new cases, exceeding previous records for the second consecutive day. Last week, Trump took aim at Fauci. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDr. Fauci\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a nice man, but he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s made a lot of mistakes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said on Sean Hannity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Fox News show. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLike you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to ban them coming in from very infected China. I did it anyway and we saved hundreds of thousands of lives.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Fauci said he did recommend restricting travel, and said pitching economic recovery at the expense of public health and the likely surge to levels seen at the beginning of the pandemic was \u00e2\u0080\u009can unfortunate mindset.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He told Zuckerberg, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t jump over steps.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Dow Jones Industrial Index DJIA, +0.56% \u00c2 closed lower Friday though stocks post modest weekly gains, as investors tracked round two of the potential fiscal stimulus. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% \u00c2 and Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39% \u00c2 ended the week up slightly.
