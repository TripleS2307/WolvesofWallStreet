HA, +0.36% said Friday that it will offer travelers from some U.S. mainland cities drive-through COVID-19 tests, so those who test negative can be exempt from Hawaii's 14-day quarantine requirement. The air carrier said the tests will be available near the international airports in Los Angeles and San Francisco. For results within 36 hours, the tests will cost $90 and will cost $150 for \"day-of-travel\" express service. \"As Hawai'i's leading airline, it is critical to ensure that access to testing does not impede travel to Hawai'i, for visitors or our kama' ina (residents),\" said Avi Mannis, senior vice president of marketing at Hawaiian. The stock, which rose 3.8% in premarket trading, has tumbled 57.7% year to date through Thursday, while the U.S. Global Jets ETF JETS, +0.16% has shed 47.4% and the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% has edged up 0.5%."}]}
