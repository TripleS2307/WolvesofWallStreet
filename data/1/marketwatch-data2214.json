The Sunshine\u2019s State department of health reported 1,698 new COVID-19 infections \u2014 almost 20 percent higher than the previous daily high of 1,419 cases recorded last Thursday. There are now at least 69,069 reported cases and 2,848 deaths tied to the outbreak in Florida, according to the latest numbers released Thursday. Gov. Ron DeSantis was asked whether he would consider rolling back reopening plans over the increase in cases \u2014 and said the spike was tied to an increase in testing, according to Local 10 News in Tallahassee. Florida reports having completed over 1.3 million COVID-19 tests, with 5.3 percent coming back positive, according to the outlet. Most of the state was allowed to begin lifting measures aimed at curbing the outbreak beginning on May 4th. The loosened restrictions allowed people to flock to the beach, some of which were packed over Memorial Day weekend. Some health experts fear the reopenings and, later, the protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody, might lead to a surge in infections. Other states, including Texas and Arizona, have also been struck with a second wave of cases weeks after reopening. This story originally appeared on NYPost.com"}]}
