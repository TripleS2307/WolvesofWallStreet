Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 NIK, -0.11% slipped 0.2% while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index HSI, -0.30% gained 0.5%. The Shanghai Composite SHCOMP, +1.67% rose 0.9% and South Korea\u2019s Kospi 180721, +0.21% advanced 0.9%. Benchmark indexes rose in Taiwan Y9999, +1.10% and Singapore STI, -0.39% , but stocks fell in Indonesia JAKIDX, +0.28% . Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 XJO, +0.00% gained 0.6%. Markets have continued gaining despite signs global economies are ailing seriously because of the outbreak, with uncertainty still the new normal as reported cases keep surging around the world while no cure or vaccine for COVID-19 is available. A quarterly Bank of Japan survey released Wednesday showed Japanese manufacturers\u2019 sentiment plunged to its lowest level in more than a decade, as the pandemic crushes exports and tourism, mainstays for the world\u2019s third largest economy. The headline measure for the \u201ctankan,\u201d tracking sentiment among large manufacturers, fell to minus 34, the lowest since 2009, from minus 8 the previous quarter. The tankan measures corporate sentiment by subtracting the number of companies saying business conditions are negative from those responding they are positive. A survey showed China\u2019s manufacturing activity improved in June, adding to signs of a gradual recovery from the country\u2019s deepest economic downturn since at least the mid-1960s. The monthly purchasing managers\u2019 index issued by a business magazine, Caixin, rose to 51.2 from May\u2019s 50.7 on a 100-point scale on which numbers above 50 indicate activity increasing. A sub-index for export orders rose to 47 from 41.7. The Chinese economy has been recovering but only slowly since global demand for exports is weak and consumers and businesses inside China are wary of further outbreaks and other risks from the pandemic. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 climbed 1.5%, bringing its gain for the quarter to nearly 20%. That rebound followed a 20% drop in the first three months of the year, the market\u2019s worst quarter since the 2008 financial crisis. The plunge came as the pandemic brought the economy to a halt and millions of people lost their jobs. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve had back-to-back (quarters) like this since the 1930s,\u201d said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty unprecedented.\u201d The whiplash that ripped through markets in the second quarter came as investors looked beyond dire unemployment numbers and became increasingly hopeful that the economy can pull out of its severe, sudden recession relatively quickly. Promises of massive amounts of aid from the Federal Reserve and Congress helped propel markets upward. Low interest rates generally push investors toward stocks and away from the low but less volatile returns from bonds, and the Federal Reserve has pinned short-term interest rates at a record low of nearly zero. The hopes looked prescient after reports during the quarter showed that employers resumed hiring again and retail sales rebounded as governments relaxed lockdown orders. But most of Wall Street says not to expect anything close to a repeat of the rocking second quarter. Rising infections have several states pausing their lifting of restrictions. The surge in confirmed new cases, which has prompted the European Union to bar U.S. travelers from entry, is seeding doubts that the economic recovery can happen as quickly as markets had forecast. That helps explain why the market\u2019s momentum cooled somewhat in June. On Tuesday Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious-disease expert, warned that the number of daily new reported infections could surge to 100,000 if Americans don\u2019t start following public health recommendations. Beyond the coronavirus, analysts also point to the upcoming U.S. elections and other risks that could upset markets. If Democrats sweep Congress and the White House, which many investors see as at least possible, it could mean higher tax rates, which could weaken corporate profits. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% gained 47.05 points to 3,100.29 on Tuesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% rose 0.9% to 25,812.88. The Nasdaq composite COMP, +1.39% climbed 1.9%, to 10,058.77. The quarter featured steady gains in technology stocks, which climbed 27.6%, second only to the consumer discretionary sector\u2019s 30.2% gain. Airlines and cruise operators traded wildly after being battered for much of the first quarter. Benchmark U.S. crude US:CLQ20 lost 56 cents to $39.83 a barrel. It slid 43 cents to $39.27 a barrel on Tuesday, still nearly double where it was at the end of the first quarter. Brent crude UK:BRNQ20 fell 56 cents to $41.15 a barrel. The U.S. dollar USDJPY, -0.38% fell to 107.82 Japanese yen from 107.93 yen."}]}
