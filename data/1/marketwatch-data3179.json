See:Full text of Obama\u2019s speech at the Democratic National Convention Even in the heat of campaigns, former presidents are typically more restrained than other politicians in their criticisms of a sitting president. Yet Obama\u2019s remarks \u2014 his most personal and direct critique of Trump yet \u2014 revealed the 44th president\u2019s personal disregard for the nation\u2019s current commander in chief and his belief that Trump presents an existential threat to American democracy. Obama\u2019s address also amounted to a call to action to a weary and anxious nation, particularly younger Americans frustrated with a government that may often appear out of touch with their own interests. Democrats see Obama as a bridge to those voters in the 2020 race, someone who can speak both to Biden\u2019s character and to the urgency of progressives pushing for more sweeping change to the nation\u2019s economic and domestic policies.

Obama forged a close personal relationship with Biden during their eight years together in the White House and has been a sounding board for him throughout the 2020 campaign. On Wednesday, Obama said that when he set out to pick a vice president, \u201cI didn\u2019t know I\u2019d end up finding a brother.\u201d Yet there\u2019s an inherent tension in Obama\u2019s role as one of the most powerful and important surrogates for Biden. Obama\u2019s own political rise was fueled by the power of barrier-breaking, generational change, and he\u2019s encouraged \u201cnew blood\u201d in politics. More recently, Obama drew attention during the 2020 Democratic primary when he said many of the world\u2019s problems have been due to \u201cold people, usually old men, not getting out of the way.\u201d With the general election now in full swing, Obama confidants say that while the former president\u2019s support for Biden is unequivocal, he does worry about enthusiasm among younger voters, particularly younger voters of color. He\u2019s well aware that one of the reasons Trump currently occupies the Oval Office is that those voters did not show up in the same large numbers in 2016 for Hillary Clinton as they did when he was on the ballot. Obama was bitingly personal in his criticism of Trump, accusing him of using the presidency to seek the \u201cattention he craves\u201d and never putting in the work required to lead the nation, particularly in times of crisis. Speaking at a news conference Wednesday, Trump shrugged off Obama\u2019s criticism, saying that if the former administration had done a good job, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d Trump added, \u201cAnd probably if they did a good job, I wouldn\u2019t have even run.\u201d Obama spoke two nights after his wife, former first lady Michelle Obama, headlined the opening night of the convention. The fact that the Obamas are headliners on two of the four nights of the Democratic celebration speaks to the crucial role they have in helping Biden try to reassemble the coalition that propelled them into the White House \u2014 and the challenge the Democratic Party has in building a new bench of other leaders who can do the same. \u201cWhen you think about folks who have the capacity to really unify us, there are only a few people,\u201d said Yvette Simpson, chief executive of Democracy for America, a progressive political action committee. \u201cCertainly Barack Obama and Michelle Obama are among them.\u201d Indeed, the former president has enviable popularity, both among Democrats and all Americans. A Fox News poll conducted in May found 93% of Democrats had a favorable opinion of Obama, as did 63% of all registered voters. Despite that strong support, there has been some rethinking of Obama\u2019s legacy among some of his party\u2019s most liberal activists, who argue he didn\u2019t go far enough in overhauling the nation\u2019s health care system and gave too much away to Republicans in fiscal negotiations. Obama himself has acknowledged there was more he wanted to do, but argued he was hamstrung by the realities of a Republican-controlled House, and eventually Senate, for much of his tenure. But some of Obama\u2019s more recent comments have energized liberals, who see signs of him embracing some of the tactics of his party\u2019s activist wing. Progressives cheered in particular when Obama called for eliminating the Senate filibuster rules requiring 60 votes on major pieces of legislation, calling it a \u201cJim Crow relic\u201d that is holding up rewriting voting rights laws. His surprise comments came during his eulogy at the funeral of the late civil rights leader and Georgia Rep. John Lewis. \u201cThat\u2019s the guy we remember from the election of 2008,\u201d Simpson said of Obama\u2019s remarks at Lewis\u2019 funeral. \u201cIt encouraged me that he might be the guy that pulls Joe Biden along a little bit.\u201d"}]}
