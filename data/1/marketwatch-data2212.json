The concern marks a stark reversal since the height of the crisis in March and April, when governors from Florida to Connecticut forced incoming New Yorkers to quarantine themselves for two weeks out of fear they\u2019d brought the virus with them. Now, rising cases in 22 states and Puerto Rico potentially pose a threat to progress in New York, which currently has one of the lowest infection rates in the country, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at a briefing on Monday. Only 1.1% of more than 56,000 COVID-19 tests came back positive on Sunday. \u201cTalk about great irony. One of our concerns now in New York is that people from the other states that have a high rate of increase of COVID virus may start traveling to New York,\u201d Cuomo said. As of Sunday, deaths fell to 27 on a three-day rolling average\u2014the lowest loss of life since the pandemic started. Total hospitalizations statewide were also down to a new low, falling to roughly 1,600 on Sunday, down from a peak of more than 18,000 in early April, the governor said. Daily Infections have flared up from Arizona to Florida, where a rash of bars have had to close in the latter since the weekend, after customers tested positive for the virus. New cases hit an all-time high across a number of states, including Florida, Alabama, South Carolina, Texas and Arkansas, in recent days, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. \u201cRemember when we started, other states were saying we don\u2019t want people from New York coming to our state because we\u2019re afraid they\u2019ll bring the virus?\u201d Cuomo said, adding that the federal government discussed blockading the state and preventing New Yorkers from leaving. Also read: The surge in coronavirus cases in some states isn\u2019t part of a \u2018second wave\u2019 \u201cFast forward 106 days later,\u201d Cuomo said, \u201cwe have the lowest infection rate, and my officials are saying we hope people from Florida don\u2019t come here.\u201d As states reopen and summer travel increases, some have suggested temperature checks at airports and other travel hubs. But Cuomo said the state hasn\u2019t made any kind of decision on protective measures against potential spread from outside. \u201cWe\u2019re not there yet,\u201d he said. For the time being, the greatest risk of spread comes from within, as New Yorkers and businesses have been openly flouting social distancing guidelines, according to more than 25,000 complaints the state received over the weekend, the governor said. Images from the weekend showed crowds gathered outside bars and restaurants without masks, especially in parts of New York City, where eateries are still takeaway only. See: Some Americans are more likely to socially distance and wear face masks than others \u2014 here\u2019s why \u201cPeople are violating everything. No masks, no social distancing,\u201d Cuomo said on Monday, reiterating that he would suspend businesses\u2019 liquor licenses if they\u2019re caught breaking reopening guidelines. On Sunday, he also threatened to roll back the phased reopenings of areas, particularly for Manhattan and the Hamptons, if social distancing rules continued to be ignored on a wide scale. He said the huge volume of calls indicates that people are scared of rising infections. \u201cThe people of the state know what they did. They know the sacrifice they made,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want anyone\u2019s irresponsibility to jeopardize that.\u201dOther developments in New York state: \u2022 The 2020 tennis U.S. Open will reportedly go ahead this year on its normal schedule from Aug. 31 to Sept. 13, but without fans. The decision still needs formal government approval, and it\u2019s unclear how many athletes will opt to compete in the annual tennis championship, held each year at the Billie Jean King Tennis Center in Queens. \u2022 Western New York will enter Phase 3 on Tuesday, and the Capital Region will follow on Wednesday. Gatherings of 25 people will be allowed in Phase 3, raised from 10, Cuomo said on Monday."}]}
