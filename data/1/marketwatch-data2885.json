AAPL, +1.74% is temporarily re-closing seven stores in the Houston area amid a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in Texas. The company confirmed Wednesday that it would be temporarily shutting its Highland Village, First Colony Mall, Houston Galleria, Memorial City, Willowbrook Mall, Baybrook, and Woodlands locations \"with an abundance of caution\" given \"current COVID-19 conditions in some of the communities we serve.\" The move comes after Apple last week moved to temporarily shut some locations in Florida, Arizona, North Carolina, and South Carolina, according to reports. Apple was among the first to shutter locations outside of China in March as the pandemic worsened, though the company has been gradually reopening stores with some restrictions on in-store activities. Apple shares are off 1.4% in Wednesday trading. They've gained 46% over the past three months as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% has risen 23%."}]}
