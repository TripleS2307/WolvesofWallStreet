Net loss for the period was 1.26 billion euros ($1.48 billion) compared with a profit of EUR1.05 billion a year earlier, the French bank said Monday. France's third-largest listed bank by assets stowed away EUR1.28 billion for soured loans, a sharp increase from the EUR314 million reported for the same period last year. In addition, it posted impairments related to its global banking and investor-solutions business, which includes investment banking and asset management: EUR684 million of goodwill impairment and EUR650 million due to impairment of deferred tax assets. Net banking income, the bank's top-line revenue figure, fell almost 16% to EUR5.30 billion. Analysts had forecast a quarterly profit of EUR139 million on revenue of EUR5.45 billion, according to a consensus forecast provided by FactSet."}]}
