All four were successful, and most were planning some form of expansion in what then seemed like a booming economy. Yet even as early as March, these owners had already tasted some of the new normal and pivoted to other business strategies. Each knew the hard part still lay ahead. In early October, we reached out again to to see how they\u2019ve made it through. There have been more downs than ups over the past few months, but amazingly, all four owners expect their 2020 business to be not far off what they\u2019d anticipated before the virus hit. Each expressed a sense of being lucky, and of watching the disparate economic impact of the virus play out across their circle of contacts, from customers to business partners to employees. All four received money from the Paycheck Protection Program, part of the stimulus package passed in the spring. They know the story isn\u2019t over yet. Each is located in cold-winter areas, from Vermont to New Jersey to Seattle, and all have the same questions: Will consumers come out? Will heat lamps work? When will things get back to normal? Earlier coverage: These small-business owners made their dreams come true \u2014 and then the coronavirus hit \u2018This whole pandemic is a tale of two economies:\u2019 Mad River Distillers, Warren, Vt. In March, when MarketWatch talked to John Egan, co-founder of Warren, Vt.-based Mad River Distillers, the company had just started to produce hand sanitizer for the local community. Sanitizer is essentially just alcohol, after all, and when it ran low in the panicky early weeks of the shutdowns, Egan realized Mad River could help. \u201cIt was as much a community-building exercise as anything else,\u201d he said in October. That pivot didn\u2019t last long, however. As well-meaning companies around the country tried to help with the pandemic efforts by pivoting to producing sanitizer, federal regulators, including the FDA and NIH, got involved. \u201cThere started to be a whole bunch of standards and over a four or five week period, you\u2019d have to check in and make sure your formulation was correct,\u201d Egan said. \u201cThere were weekly conference calls and people were attempting to stay up with the regulatory requirements but as each government agency got involved, they added additional things.\u201d About six-eight weeks into the crisis, producers started to drop out of the sanitizer effort, \u201cand then the regular supply chain started supplying it,\u201d Egan said. \u201cWe still have some available if people want it but It\u2019s really gone back to the normal providers handling that.\u201d For Mad River\u2019s regular beverage business, it\u2019s been a tough year. \u201cWe depend on an in-person experience,\u201d Egan explained. \u201cPeople want to hear the craft brew story from the bartender. If they don\u2019t get that, they go to the store and buy Jim Beam or Bud Light.\u201d The company applied for a PPP loan and got a small one \u201cwith the help of our local community banker from Montpelier,\u201d Egan said. \u201cIt has been helpful to us in bringing everybody back sooner than we might otherwise have been able to.\u201d In its Burlington, Vt. location, Mad River has a tasting room, which is open at 50% capacity with a reservation, up from 25% over the summer. They\u2019ve also fanned out to farmer\u2019s markets, although they can\u2019t offer customers the chance to taste the alcohol there. Egan finds the virus\u2019s economic impact unsettling. \u201cThis whole pandemic is a tale of two economies,\u201d he said. \u201cThe markets have done well, the professional workers, the people who own stocks, have done well. In Massachusetts,\u201d where Mad River has distribution partners, the unemployment rate is high. \u201cThe people who live paycheck to paycheck are most impacted by that.\u201d Mad River Distillers server Connor welcomes guests to the tasting room. Courtesy Mad River Distillers. How has business been overall? \u201cThere was an eight- week period in the spring that felt like we fell off a cliff,\u201d Egan said, but they\u2019ve almost made that up. \u201cThis year may be on par with last year, which is extraordinary. We had been hoping to grow but in this environment I\u2019ll take treading water all day long.\u201d But 2020 may still have some challenges ahead. \u201cFor the hospitality industry, everyone\u2019s worried about November and December,\u201d Egan said. \u201cThe regulations and the weather are going to conspire against people.\u201d \u2018We\u2019re definitely worried about how this winter is going to look:\u2019 Axe and Arrow Brewing, Glassboro, N.J. Glassboro, N.J.-based Axe and Arrow Brewing had barely been open a year when lockdowns began. \u201cWe were just starting to hit our stride,\u201d co-owner Krystle Lockman told MarketWatch last March as she canned beer while watching her twin six-year-olds do their homework in a booth. Lockman and her partners sold canned beer and growlers through the spring, and then once they were able to open up for outdoor seating, their landlord granted them an additional patio space. Now, they\u2019ve got more outdoor space than in the original indoor space. And after having to ask her entire part-time staff to stop showing up, and laying off her one full-time employee so that he could collect unemployment, \u201cwe\u2019re back with full force,\u201d and even made a few additional hires, she said. But there have been some hard decisions to make. \u201cWe are allowed to have 25% capacity indoors, but we\u2019ve chosen not to do that,\u201d Lockman said. With that privilege comes a long list of mandates, including having to watch customers\u2019 mask-wearing. \u201cIt\u2019s too much to ask my people to police that,\u201d she said. And while canning is helping pay the bills, it\u2019s much lower-margin than the restaurant business. \u201cWe really need the tap room to be able to support operations,\u201d she said. Axe and Arrow received an $11,000 PPP loan, and Lockman is now waiting to see how much will be forgiven. Against all odds, her revenue projections for the brewery\u2019s second year in business are \u201cnot far off,\u201d she said. It\u2019s the expenses that are the challenge. There\u2019s additional rent for the second patio, a giant tent over part of it, which cost \u201ca couple thousand,\u201d five heaters at about $1,000 each, and as soon as Lockman can settle on the right electric heaters to buy for the rest of the patio, those expenses as well. \u201cNow we\u2019re a little worried because the nice weather is going to get chilly. If we lived in a climate that wouldn\u2019t get any colder we\u2019d be able to operate like this. I don\u2019t foresee people coming in the rain if it\u2019s cold. I don\u2019t foresee people coming out if it\u2019s really cold. We\u2019re definitely worried about how this winter is going to look.\u201d\u2018It\u2019s really sad when you work so hard on something\u2026 to close it down:\u2019 Hello Robin, Seattle, Wa Hello Robin is a Seattle neighborhood cookie shop with a national following. It\u2019s been in business several years, and has proven so successful that shop owners Robin Wehl Martin and her husband, Clay Martin, were in the process of expanding to a second location across town. Shortly after speaking to MarketWatch in late March, Martin closed the shop, and it stayed closed for 12 weeks. The state had mandated all non-essential businesses close, and as Robin put it, she might have made the argument that the cookie shop was, in fact, essential, but \u201cit just seemed like the right thing to do was to encourage people to stay home,\u201d she said. \u201cThe day after we shut down, I went in and scrubbed all the surfaces and sealed everything up,\u201d Robin said. \u201cI was ready to give up. It\u2019s really sad when you work so hard on something and you feel like it\u2019s in a really good place, to close it down.\u201d The first weekend back in business was June 19, and in a nod to \u201cJuneteenth,\u201d the shop donated all revenue to Black Lives Matter organizations. \u201cPeople did come back in a substantial way when we opened,\u201d Robin said. \u201cThat first Friday was one of our busiest days ever.\u201d Since then, it\u2019s been a matter of taking the good \u2013 like a local pizza chain placing an order for 20,000 cookies to try to help support other neighborhood businesses \u2013 with the bad, like missing out on catering opportunities. Still, Clay estimates the company will do roughly 80% of the business they did in 2019. \u201cWe really can\u2019t complain,\u201d he said. The company received a PPP loan through Square SQ, +2.06%, and expect most of it will be forgiven. The original location, in Seattle\u2019s Capitol Hill, has gotten by with just a take-out window for selling baked goods and frozen dough. And the new location is in a completely outdoor area. \u201cI just feel very lucky,\u201d Robin said. \u201cI feel lucky that we\u2019re not a bar. We just have these key factors that have by chance worked in our favor.\u201d Still, in the new set-up, there are some things she misses. \u201cI feel the absence of the customer. Normally kids and families and people come in and we get to know them. There are kids who come in who are seven, who we met when the moms were pregnant. We\u2019ve been through life cycles with people.\u201d\u2018I totally agree with the stimulus checks\u2026but we\u2019ve got to be careful about how much support we continue to give:\u2019 The Shop, Seattle, Wa Matt Bell\u2019s labor of love, The Shop, is a unique enterprise \u2013 a \u201ccar club\u201d where aficionados can garage their wheels, mingle in a club-like atmosphere, or enjoy a meal in the restaurant, which was also open to the public. The Shop's new outdoor space in Seattle. Photo courtesy The Shop. It had done so well in Seattle that Bell decided to open a second location in Dallas in June, and construction was underway. But work came to a screeching halt in the spring, and then Bell found himself agonizing over whether or not to move ahead. \u201cThe hardest dynamic for me and the most stress I\u2019ve had is trying to predict the future,\u201d he said in October. \u201cWhen do you fund initiatives to grow again and when do you hold back and wait? That\u2019s tricky when you\u2019re used to growing. when is that right time?\u201d Eventually, he did decide to start back up, and is now hoping for a December or January opening date. At the Seattle location, Bell had a deck built outside so the restaurant could operate \u2013 though he is also concerned about the coming cold weather. And there have been other, unexpected, considerations. When The Shop re-opened and tried to bring staff back to work, some didn\u2019t want to return, Bell said: they were making more money on unemployment. \u201cI totally agree with the stimulus checks,\u201d Bell said. \u201cThat\u2019s pumped money into the economy and it\u2019s helped people and businesses but we\u2019ve got to be careful about how much support we continue to give. The government has made it a tough decision for some people to come back to work.\u201d He did apply for and receive \u201ca six-figure\u201d PPP loan, which funded the construction of the outdoor area in Seattle, and says he expects 80% of it to be forgiven. Because he\u2019s been traveling \u2013 on planes \u2013 back and forth between Seattle and Dallas, Bell is most struck by what he calls \u201cthe polar opposites\u201d in the two areas, \u201cboth in terms of the rules and the consumer mindset. People in Dallas seem to be more interested in going out and getting back to some normalcy and in Seattle, people are not ready.\u201d Bell finds his bifurcated life unsettling. \u201cI spend time in Dallas and I think Seattle needs to really move forward, and I\u2019ll be back in Seattle and think, why is Dallas moving so quickly? It doesn\u2019t seem safe and right. It\u2019s a sign of our country. There are polar extremes. I wish there was state or national consistency across the board. I can see how people are frustrated with each other.\u201d Read: It was fair winds and following seas for small-business owners like these ship captains. Then came coronavirus"}]}
