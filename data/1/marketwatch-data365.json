She\u2019s been a conscientious employee, but she hasn\u2019t been able to save much for her future because of years of family caretaking, student debt and low wages. But she\u2019ll be able to enjoy retirement. That\u2019s because she had money set aside for her on the day she was born, and it\u2019s compounded over decades as she\u2019s aged. She didn\u2019t get this nest egg from her parents and it isn\u2019t Social Security \u2014 though the government does manage it. This asset, an interest-bearing account, is also known as a \u201cbaby bond.\u201d Legislators, financial experts and social analysts say baby bonds could solve money problems dogging Americans in old age. Not all Americans are prepared for the future. The trust funds that support Social Security \u2014 a lifeline for many elderly Americans \u2014 are at risk of depletion in the next 15 years, but politicians have yet to decide on a solution. And not everyone has access to a workplace retirement account, or can afford to invest for their old age. The pandemic has made things worse for many people. Millions of workers have lost their jobs because of the health crisis, and statistics show some races suffer more than others in building wealth. Even before the coronavirus crisis began, workers had trouble saving for their futures. Roughly half of Americans do not participate in an employer-sponsored retirement account, such as a 401(k) plan, according to a 2018 Stanford Center on Longevity report. Enter a proposal for \u201cbaby bonds\u201d targeting retirement security. The concept, created by financial adviser Ric Edelman, would act as a supplement to Social Security, but it could eventually replace it and wouldn\u2019t cost the government any money. There are many proposals floating around about baby bonds, including one from New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, but Edelman\u2019s focuses solely on retirement concerns. Edelman\u2019s proposal is \u201cThe T.R.U.S.T. Fund for America,\u201d short for \u201cTomorrow\u2019s Retirement for the U.S. Today.\u201d Edelman and his wife, Jean, started Edelman Financial Services in 1987, which merged with Financial Engines, an automated investment platform, in 2018. Edelman, founder of Edelman Financial Engines, has also authored numerous personal finance books, including \u201cThe Truth About Your Future,\u201d and is the host of a weekly podcast of the same name. \u201cWe are facing long-term economic challenges,\u201d Edelman said. \u201cThis program is designed to help solve retirement security for today\u2019s children.\u201d This is how his proposal works. At birth, children would receive an account with $7,500. The money would come from investors, such as corporations, pensions and those who already purchase government bonds, and would be invested in a new type of investment similar to Series EE bonds, an already established interest-bearing account. This new investment would be earmarked specifically for this program. None of the money would come from taxpayer funding. The invested money would grow over the span of 30 years, at which point those bonds would pay interest to the investors, as other savings bonds currently do today. The rest of the money in those accounts, which Americans could not touch, would continue to grow until the recipient was around 66 years old \u2014 similar to Social Security\u2019s Full Retirement Age index. \u201c A $7,500 investment goes a long way. That investment at birth in this type of proposal would grow to become the equivalent of an average person\u2019s Social Security benefit. \u201d There are still details to work out, such as if there would be a tax credit or how the government could encourage investors to participate in this program. Still, the concept of investing in specific bonds like this is not uncommon \u2014 individual investors, corporations and pensions already allocate a portion of their portfolios to a variety of assets, some of which serve specific purposes. Pensions, for example, invest in real estate and gold. Investing in something like this form of a \u201cbaby bond\u201d would just be a way to fund this security, which is providing the investors with interest, while allowing the program to remain independent of government funding. The program\u2019s calculations account for Americans living until age 100, much longer than the average life expectancy of about 86 years old. Under this plan, any money that a retiree did not get because she died before turning 100 would be returned to the program to be distributed to those who live beyond their 100th birthdays. An independent federal agency would oversee this program, similarly to the way an independent agency manages the Thrift Savings Plan, the retirement account system for government workers. A $7,500 investment goes a long way. That investment at birth in this type of proposal would grow to become the equivalent of an average person\u2019s Social Security benefit, Edelman said. The average monthly Social Security benefit in June was $1,514, or about $18,170 a year, though how much a beneficiary receives depends on factors including age, when she claimed, earnings through her career and how many years she paid into the system. This means people who rely on Social Security for most, if not all, of their retirement income would get twice as much money when they\u2019re older, or \u2014 in a worst-case scenario \u2014 this income would replace Social Security benefits if that program were to falter. A child with a $6,750 government-funded portfolio of index funds could earn $1 million by retirement, Bill Ackman, the chairman of Pershing Square Capital Management, said in an investors note. \u201cMy proposal gives the same benefit with a one-time contribution of $7,500 because my proposal allows money to grow from birth \u2014 the average American doesn\u2019t get a job until his 20s, and that\u2019s when they begin payroll taxes,\u201d Edelman said. \u201cThe power of compounding does miraculous things.\u201d Baby bonds have the potential to keep more Americans out of poverty in retirement, but the idea is not without its weaknesses, said Jialu Streeter, a research scholar at the Stanford Center on Longevity. For Edelman\u2019s proposal to work, some assumptions have to be made, including the interest and return rates on this money, the strength of the equity market to handle this influx of cash and the credibility of the government to manage these funds for centuries. Still, something must be done to rectify the retirement crisis. Although there is no magic number someone needs to save for retirement security \u2014 that amount depends on numerous factors, including health, location, family and lifestyle \u2014 a person could expect to require hundreds of thousands of dollars over the course of retirement. Health care in retirement alone for a 65-year-old couple leaving the workforce in 2020 is roughly $295,000, and that does not include over-the-counter medications, glasses or long-term care insurance, according to Fidelity Investments. The Fidelity figure also doesn\u2019t take into consideration housing, groceries, familial responsibility and lifestyle. Americans need roughly 70% of their pre-retirement income to live comfortably after leaving the workforce, according to the New School\u2019s Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis. For someone who earns $75,000 a year, that\u2019s about $52,500 a year that needs to be replaced \u2014 or three times the average amount Americans receive in Social Security retirement benefits in a given year. Not all workers are able to achieve that replacement ratio, however. The average worker who retires at 62 replaces about 55% of their pre-retirement income, and the pandemic has the potential to drop that figure to about 48%. On top of that, unexpected hardships, such as the current crisis, have the potential to derail any retirement plan, as some Americans have recently experienced. Congress passed sweeping legislation in December to bolster retirement security. The law, called the Secure Act, allowed small businesses to band together to offer their employees employer-sponsored retirement accounts, as well as welcomed annuities into 401(k) plans more freely and pushed back required minimum distributions. The Secure Act also encouraged auto-enrollment of workplace retirement accounts, which has proven to help many Americans save more money for their futures by automatically placing them into a retirement plan and contributing a portion of their paychecks. The other variations of the baby bond proposal focus more on other major life milestones that could help Americans on their journeys to retirement \u2014 including those that end up becoming the reasons why people don\u2019t have enough saved for their old age. Sen. Booker and Darrick Hamilton, an economics and urban policy professor at The New School, have proposed two additional versions of the baby bond. As part of Booker\u2019s proposal, a child would get a $1,000 endowment at birth and additional deposits could be made in the following years based on family income. The money, which the government would fund, would be invested in Treasurys or mutual funds. The assets could only be touched beginning at age 18 for milestone events, such as to pay for college tuition or help fund the down payment of a home. \u201cThis is saying everyone as a birthright has access to capital,\u201d Hamilton said during an Urban Institute virtual event alongside Sen. Booker. \u201cAt birth, you get an account and that forges a stakeholder society, similar to Social Security, that is independent of your race, your family, your gender or your family\u2019s circumstance.\u201d Under their plans, the money set aside in these interest-bearing accounts could be used for qualifying circumstances, such as paying for higher education, starting a business or funding a down payment for a home, said Kilolo Kijakazi, a fellow at the Urban Institute. \u201cThis proposal can solve all of the challenges that we are facing,\u201d she said. Those major events contribute to the barriers of retirement security. For example, student debt deters workers from saving money for their futures because they\u2019re trying to pay down thousands of dollars in staggering student loans. An entrepreneur could generate substantial earnings with the start of her business, but that becomes challenging without capital. A home is a key way to build wealth, but entering the housing market is difficult and unaffordable without a substantial down payment. Minorities face even higher hurdles in these milestones than their white counterparts, studies have shown. Implementing baby bonds would be just one step in the right direction, Booker said. \u201cIt has a multiplier effect,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you create more wealth in America, it tends to grow and spread more equally and create more opportunities for us all.\u201d"}]}
