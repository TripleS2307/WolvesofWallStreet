The flames up and down the West Coast have destroyed neighborhoods, leaving nothing but charred rubble and burned-out cars, forced tens of thousands to flee and cast a shroud of smoke that has given Seattle, San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, some of the worst air quality in the world. The smoke filled the air with an acrid metallic smell like pennies and spread to nearby states. While making it difficult to breathe, it helped firefighters by blocking the sun and turning the weather cooler as they tried to get a handle on the blazes, which were slowing in some places. But warnings of low moisture and strong winds that could fan the flames added urgency to the battle. The so-called red flag warnings stretched from hard-hit southern Oregon to Northern California and extended through Monday evening. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Lexi Soulios, her husband and son were afraid they would have to evacuate for a second time because of the weather. They left their small southern Oregon town of Talent last week when they saw a \u201cbig, huge flow of dark smoke coming up,\u201d then went past roadblocks Friday to pick through the charred ruins of their home. While they are staying farther south in Ashland, known for the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, she said by text message that the forecast may mean they could be on the move again. \u201cSo this isn\u2019t over yet but we just had the car checked so we feel prepared,\u201d Lexi Soulios wrote. Authorities last week reported as many as 50 people could be missing after a wildfire in the Ashland area. But the Jackson County sheriff\u2019s office said late Saturday that four people had died in the blaze and that the number of missing was down to one. At least 10 people have been killed in the past week throughout Oregon. Officials have said more people are missing from other fires, and the number of fatalities is likely to rise, though they have not said how high the toll could go as they search. In California, 24 people have died, and one in Washington state. Thousands of homes and other buildings have burned. Barbara Rose Bettison, 25, left her farm among the trees and fields of Eagle Creek, outside Portland, when a sheriff\u2019s deputy knocked on her door Tuesday. They drove away on a road that became an ominous dividing line, with blue skies on one side and the other filled with black and brown smoke. She took shelter at an Elks Lodge near Portland, where evacuees wrapped themselves in blankets and set up tents out back. \u201cIt\u2019s terrifying. We\u2019ve never had any form of natural disaster,\u201d she said. Bettison, a UPS driver, was able to get out with her chickens, rabbits and cats. She hasn\u2019t been back, but neighbors said it is so smoky they can\u2019t see their hands in front of their faces. \u201cI\u2019m hoping there has not been too much damage because it would break my heart,\u201d she said. Farther south in the town of Talent, Dave Monroe came to his burned home, partially hoping he\u2019d find his three cats. \u201cWe thought we\u2019d get out of this summer with no fires,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is something going on, that\u2019s for sure, man. Every summer we\u2019re burning up.\u201d Numerous studies in recent years have linked bigger wildfires in the U.S. to global warming from the burning of coal, oil and gas. The Democratic governors of all three states say the fires are a consequence of climate change, taking aim at President Donald Trump ahead of his visit Monday to California for a fire briefing. \u201cIt is maddening right now that when we have this cosmic challenge to our communities, with the entire West Coast of the United States on fire, to have a president to deny that these are not just wildfires, these are climate fires,\u201d Washington Gov. Jay Inslee said Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d At a rally in Nevada, Trump blamed inadequate forest management, which White House adviser Peter Navarro echoed on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d saying that for many years in California, \u201cparticularly because of budget cutbacks, there was no inclination to manage our forests.\u201d Firefighter Steve McAdoo has run from one blaze to another in Oregon for six days, seeing buildings burn and trees light up like candles. \u201cWe lost track of time because you can\u2019t see the sun and you\u2019ve been up for so many days,\u201d he said. \u201cForty-eight to 72 hours nonstop, you feel like you\u2019re in a dream.\u201d As he and his team battled the blazes, McAdoo worried about his wife and daughter at home just miles away. They evacuated safely, but at times he could communicate with them only in one-word text messages: \u201cbusy.\u201d McAdoo and other firefighters got their first real break Sunday to take showers, shave and check their equipment. And though it\u2019s a faint shadow of its usual self, he can finally see the sun. \u201cIt\u2019s nice today to at least see the dot in the sky,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, Oregon\u2019s fire marshal, who resigned after being placed on leave amid a personnel investigation, says he was trying to help a colleague and \u201cdidn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d Jim Walker told TV news station KOIN in Portland that state police leaders put him on leave after he tried to help a co-worker whose family was missing in a fire zone, saying his superiors decided he had overstepped his authority."}]}
