The guidance states that the primary efficacy endpoint in a placebo-controlled efficacy clinical trial should be at least 50%, meaning the vaccine needs \"to reduce the risk of disease caused by COVID-19 by 50%\" when compared to the placebo, according to Brad Loncar, a longtime biotech investor and CEO of Loncar Investments. There are a number of drugmakers developing COVID-19 vaccine candidates including AstraZeneca AZN, +1.16% and the University of Oxford, Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc. INO, -1.36%, and Moderna Inc. MRNA, +0.09%, two of which (Inovio and Moderna) have disclosed preliminary data from their Phase 1 trials. A return to economic normalcy has largely been tied to the arrival of vaccines that can prevent infections from the coronavirus. \"There is no guarantee...that we will have a safe and effective vaccine, but we are cautiously optimistic,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, testified during the same hearing."}]}
