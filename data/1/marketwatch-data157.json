Saturday will be day 10 since Thursday's diagnosis, and based on the trajectory of advanced diagnostics the team has been conducting, I fully anticipate the President's safe return to public engagements at that time.\" Trump, 74, received experimental \"polyclonal antibodies\" and oxygen at the White House on Friday after being diagnosed with the virus Thursday. Trump was hospitalized three nights at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., after arriving by helicopter Friday. Trump was discharged Monday. At the hospital, he received doses of the antiviral drug remdesivir and the steroid dexamethasone. In a Thursday interview with Fox Business Network, Trump attributed his apparently rapid recovery with him being \"a perfect physical specimen\" and \"extremely young.\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) questioned Trump's sanity and unveiled a bill to set up a commission to analyze the president's mental fitness, to potentially justify his removal from power under the 25th Amendment. Trump is anxious to return to the campaign trail in the remaining weeks before the Nov. 3 election. On Thursday morning, the Commission on Presidential Debates said that it would make next Thursday's scheduled debate in Miami between Trump and Democratic candidate Joe Biden a virtual forum - which Trump rejected. Biden in turn rejected Trump's proposal to delay the remaining two debates. In taped remarks, Trump credited the polyclonal antibodies infusion with making him feel better almost immediately. He reported no symptoms on Tuesday or Wednesday, Conley said in prior releases. A version of this report appears on NYPost.com."}]}
