A majority of U.S. states will find prices this Labor Day weekend that are \u201cas low as they\u2019ve been for that holiday since 2004,\u201d said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for the Oil Price Information Service (OPIS), in a note to clients Friday. \u201cThe cheapest holiday travel in 16 years is all the more remarkable since dozens of states have added various state and local taxes to the price of fuel in that time.\u201d The average U.S. retail price for regular gasoline as of Aug. 31 stood at $2.22 a gallon\u2014the lowest for this time of year since 2004, according to weekly data from the Energy Information Administration. In a report released Friday, the government agency attributed the \u201crelatively low\u201d price to \u201ccontinued low demand for gasoline since mid-March, as travel demand fell because of efforts to limit the spread of coronavirus.\u201d Implied demand for motor gasoline averaged 8.9 million barrels a day over the past four weeks ended Aug. 28, down 8.9% from the same period last year, according to EIA data. As of late Friday morning, the average regular gasoline price was at $2.22, according to travel and navigation app Gasbuddy. It was down about 35 cents a gallon from a year ago. OPIS said Americans will only spend about $3 billion on motor fuel during the four day weekend, which traditionally marks the end of the summer travel season. That compares with $5.4 billion in gasoline spending for the Labor Day holiday travel season in 2014, it said. Also see:Hurricane Laura may do little to disturb relative calm in summer gasoline prices \u201c \u2018Once vacation travel ends, we\u2019ll continue to see gasoline demand that falls well short of what was recorded in 2017, 2018, and 2019.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Tom Kloza, OPIS Prices for gasoline are expected to stay low through the end of the year, said Kloza. \u201cOnce vacation travel ends, we\u2019ll continue to see gasoline demand that falls well short of what was recorded in 2017, 2018, and 2019,\u201d he said. \u201cThe sharp cutback in commuting, together with high unemployment and a lack of recreational venues will limit consumption through the next four months.\u201d"}]}
