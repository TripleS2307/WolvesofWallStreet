Trump told Woodward in interviews for the storied journalist\u2019s new book, \u201cRage,\u201d that the coronavirus was \u201cdeadly stuff,\u201d even as he minimized the health threat publicly by telling Americans that COVID-19 was \u201cunder control\u201d and \u201cgoing to disappear.\u201d CNN and the Washington Post published accounts of the comments from advance copies of the book, and released copies of the audio tapes. \u201cI wanted to always play it down,\u201d Trump told Woodward on March 19, days after he had declared COVID-19 a national emergency. \u201cI still like playing it down, because I don\u2019t want to create a panic.\u201d Trump acknowledged the tapes were authentic on Fox News Wednesday night. Trump\u2019s Democratic rival for the November presidential race Joe Biden immediately condemned the president for failing to do his job and protect the American people. \u201cHe had the information. He knew how dangerous it was. And while this deadly disease ripped through our nation, he failed to do his job on purpose,\u201d said Biden. \u201cIt was a life-and-death betrayal of the American people,\u201d Biden added, speaking at a campaign event in Warren, Michigan. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond despicable. It\u2019s a dereliction of duty. It\u2019s a disgrace.\u201d Read:Trump himself asks why Woodward didn\u2019t immediately report the president\u2019s comments about playing down the coronavirus Health experts said the failure to fully inform the public of the threat posed by the virus meant the U.S. lost valuable time. \u201cClearly, he admits that this was airborne, a respiratory illness,\u201d said Kavita Patel, a primary care physician and health policy expert who served in the Obama White House in an interview with MSNBC. \u201cI think about how much we fumbled, even myself in the beginning, with recommending that people not wear masks. First we thought, no, we don\u2019t want to take away masks from medical personnel. Now we have studies that show that if we\u2019d had widespread mask-wearing mandates, we could have reduced deaths by as much as 20% to even 50%. \u201cSome of the modeling coming out of the University of Washington reinforces that mask wearing and being outdoors can make that much of a difference,\u201d she said. A more strenuous effort early on in the pandemic would not just have saved lives, she said, but also helped the millions of people who are suffering longer term effects that doctors know little about, said Patel. \u201cWe do have the science, it did take us time and the president, he called this thing a hoax, but now we know better,\u201d she said. In case you missed it:To defeat COVID-19, \u2018we need a unified national strategy,\u2019 says public health expert Dr. Howard Koh Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital and an instructor at Harvard Medical School, said he was shocked by Trump\u2019s comments. \u201cAs a physician, it just doesn\u2019t ring true to have that moment even occur. When we have a patient who has a problem we tell them the truth about it. We say here is the situation, here is the prognosis, here are your options, whether its good new or bad news. We have to trust people with the information so they can make a choice that\u2019s good for them.\u201d Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms tweeted that her husband Derek Bottoms, a vice president of employment practices and associate relations at Home Depot, continues to suffer the side effects of his bout with COVID-19: iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } The U.S. counted another 33,201 new cases of the virus on Wednesday, according to a New York Times tracker, and at least 1,176 new fatalities.

France recorded its second highest number of new cases on Wednesday at more than 8,557, with the country\u2019s scientific committee created to manage the crisis warning that the government \u201c\u201cwill be forced to take a certain number of difficult decisions \u2026 in the next 8-10 days at most,\u201d the paper reported. The head of the committee Jean-Francois Delfraissy said France is now at a \u201cworrying level,\u201d and is \u201cnot far behind Spain with a lag of maybe two weeks, and much more severe than Italy.\u201d \u2022 India had another record day for new cases at 95,735, according to its health ministry, as Reuters reported. The country of 1.4 billion people counted 1,172 fatalities, the news agency reported, the highest single-day mortality rate in more than a month. Infections are climbing faster in India than anywhere else and the country is second to the U.S. by case numbers, the Johns Hopkins data shows. \u2022 There was some good news for New York City, one of the hardest-hit areas of the U.S. by COVID-19. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said indoor dining can resume at the end of the month, albeit at greatly reduced capacity and with safeguards in place. Restaurants will be allowed to serve guests indoors at 25% of their usual capacity, the governor said. Diners will be required to wear face coverings when not seated; at least one member of each party must provide information for contact tracing; temperature checks will be given at the door; no bar seating will be permitted; and restaurants will close at midnight. Businesses will also be required to operate with enhanced air filtration systems, a requirement similar to one of the stipulations used for gym reopenings.

The number of Americans who applied for unemployment benefits through state and federal programs rose in early September for the third week in a row, signaling that a gradual improvement in the labor market during the summer has stalled, MarketWatch\u2019s Jeffry Bartash reported. Initial jobless claims filed traditionally through state employment offices were unchanged at a seasonally adjusted 884,000 in the week of Aug. 30 to Sept. 5, the Labor Department said Thursday. Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast new claims to fall to 840,000. Yet new claims rose when including self-employed workers who applied for benefits under a separate federal program. Some 838,916 people filed under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance Act. That put the number of actual or unadjusted new claims at 1.69 million, compared to 1.59 million in the prior week. Federal filings have risen four weeks in a row.

AAL, +0.34% and MGM Resorts International MGM, -2.59% said earlier this month they would cut more jobs permanently because demand is still in a slump and federal aid has dried up. Read: Did the expired $600 federal jobless benefit keep people from going back to work?

The company says its insurers have failed to pay on policies that protect against business interruption. The payments total about $175 million. \u201cWhile insurance money helped us to rebuild after suffering the devastating impact of 9/11, we now have no viable alternative but to begin the closure of our beloved family business because our insurers, to whom we have paid significant premiums every year for protection against unforeseen circumstances like we are experiencing today, have turned their backs on us at this most critical time,\u201d said Century 21 co-Chief Executive Raymond Gindi in a statement. Century 21 has been in business for 60 years. Going out of business sales will take place at store locations and online.
