Andrew Bailey said in an interview that the two sides should be able to strike a deal, if only because \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is in the interest of both sides \u00e2\u0080\u0094 let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s be blunt \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to get an agreement.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In a separate intervention before an EU panel on Thursday, Bailey acknowledged that the post-Brexit transition \u00e2\u0080\u009cwould have been easier had we not have to deal with COVID.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Opinion: The U.K. economy was crippled before the virus hit. More reason for the government to be careful about Brexit The outlook: Both camps acknowledge that \u00e2\u0080\u009csignificant differences\u00e2\u0080\u009d remain on both the state aid and the fisheries questions. The upbeat mood does signal a change of tone compared with the previous weeks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 acrimony. But in the last months, sudden warnings or ultimatums have often followed days of cautious optimism. The EU launched a legal procedure last week against the U.K.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recent \u00e2\u0080\u0098internal market bill,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 which reneges on key aspects of the withdrawal agreement and its protocol on Ireland signed by the two sides last year. Before a deal can be struck, it may require the EU leaders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ultimate green light next week, which would then lead to both sides rushing to claim major political victories, however serious or flimsy the evidence.
