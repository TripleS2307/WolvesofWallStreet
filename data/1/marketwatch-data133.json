Andrew Bailey said in an interview that the two sides should be able to strike a deal, if only because \"it is in the interest of both sides - let's be blunt - to get an agreement.\" In a separate intervention before an EU panel on Thursday, Bailey acknowledged that the post-Brexit transition \"would have been easier had we not have to deal with COVID.\" Opinion: The U.K. economy was crippled before the virus hit. More reason for the government to be careful about Brexit The outlook: Both camps acknowledge that \"significant differences\" remain on both the state aid and the fisheries questions. The upbeat mood does signal a change of tone compared with the previous weeks' acrimony. But in the last months, sudden warnings or ultimatums have often followed days of cautious optimism. The EU launched a legal procedure last week against the U.K.'s recent 'internal market bill,' which reneges on key aspects of the withdrawal agreement and its protocol on Ireland signed by the two sides last year. Before a deal can be struck, it may require the EU leaders' ultimate green light next week, which would then lead to both sides rushing to claim major political victories, however serious or flimsy the evidence.
