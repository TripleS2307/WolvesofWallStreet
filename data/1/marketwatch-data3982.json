Stress test results put pressure on future payouts", "body": "(Updates story with comments from James Shanahan, a financial-services analyst at Edward Jones.) The Federal Reserve on Thursday announced the results of its annual stress tests for 33 large U.S. banks and U.S. subsidiaries of foreign banks. Since the Fed\u2019s \u201cseverely adverse scenario\u201d for the stress tests was designed in February, before the coronavirus pandemic caused a recession, the regulator also conducted \u201csensitivity analyses\u201d to reflect a harsher economic reality. As you can see in the table below, Wells Fargo & Co. WFC, appears at greatest risk for a dividend cut among the \u201cbig six\u201d U.S. banks. The Fed announced steps to make sure the banks maintained their capital strength, but one member of the Federal Reserve Board said publicly that the measures weren\u2019t strong enough. Under the severely adverse economic scenario used in the stress tests, the U.S. unemployment rate would peak at 10% in the third quarter of 2021. Since the U.S. unemployment rate had already climbed to 14.7% in April (improving to 13.3% in May), it was obvious that the COVID-19 outbreak had to be considered. The sensitivity analysis included three economic recovery scenarios, with unemployment peaking at levels ranging from 15.6% to 19.5%. The good news, according to Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Randal Quarles, was that \u201cthe banking system remains well capitalized under even the harshest of these downside scenarios \u2014 which are very harsh indeed.\u201d He also said the banks will be required to \u201cresubmit and update their capital plans later this year to reflect current stresses.\u201d Here\u2019s the entire statement from Quarles.Shoring up capital \u2014 then backing off a bit The largest U.S. banks had already suspended their stock buyback programs, but the Fed said these suspensions were now required for the stress-tested banks. Quarles also said \u201dbanks will be prohibited from increasing their dividends and will be further limited in their dividend payments based on recent income. In its summary of the coronavirus sensitivity analyses, the Fed said third-quarter dividend payments could \u201cnot exceed an amount equal to the average of the firm\u2019s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters.\u201d That\u2019s a lot less strict than looking only at the first and second quarters of 2020, which have been greatly affected by the COVID-19 outbreak and incredible rise in unemployment. The banks\u2019 first-quarter earnings were down because of higher provisions for loan loss reserves, in anticipation of loans souring during the coronavirus recession. At the same time, the \u201cbig six\u201d U.S. banks have been seeing a bump in trading and underwriting revenue, so there are many moving parts. Using consensus estimates for second-quarter earnings from FactSet and reported cash dividends paid on common and preferred stock, here\u2019s a comparison of four-quarter estimated earnings averages and first-quarter dividends paid: Bank Ticker Estimated average net income - four quarters through June ($mil) Cash dividends on Common and preferred shares - first quarter ($mil) J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, -0.57% $5,968 $3,188 Bank of America Corp BAC, +0.47% $4,999 $2,083 Citigroup Inc. C, +0.47% $3,372 $1,365 Wells Fargo & Co. WFC, $2,207 $2,312 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, -0.21% $1,557 $538 Morgan Stanley MS, -0.34% $1,909 $688 Sources: FactSet, company filings Only Wells Fargo paid cash dividends during the first quarter that exceeded its estimated four-quarter average of net income through the second quarter. There are many unknowns. For example, second-quarter provisions for loan losses may come in lower than expected. But from the above numbers, it would appear third-quarter dividends are likely to be unchanged from the second quarter, except possibly for Wells Fargo. In a report published Friday, Jefferies equity analyst Ken Usdin wrote that Wells Fargo \u201cremains the bank that appears closest to the line in terms of having the greatest risk of cutting its dividend (to some extent).\u201d Oppenheimer managing director Chris Kotowski wrote in a Friday note that for the banking industry, dividend payments will be a \u201cquarter-by-quarter decision,\u201d except for Wells Fargo, \u201cwhere there is clear risk to the dividend from idiosyncratic issues.\u201d Wells Fargo operates under a consent order with the Fed, under which the bank must continue to improve its corporate governance and limit asset growth. According to James Shanahan, a financial-services analyst at Edward Jones, stock buybacks made up 75% of capital returns (buybacks and dividends) for the largest eight U.S. banks during 2018 and 2019. \u201cThe banks\u2019 voluntarily suspending buybacks in mid-March through the second quarter was already far more impactful for the preservation of capital,\u201d he said during an interview. The banks will make their capital-plan announcements on Monday, June 29, after the market close.Fed\u2019s Brainard says to suspend dividend payments Lael Brainard, a member of the Fed\u2019s Board of Governors, said in a statement that the banks\u2019 strong capital buffers were allowing them to \u201cplay a constructive role in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d But she is against giving a \u201cgreen light for large banks to deplete capital\u201d and believes it is time to suspend dividend payments entirely. Earnings increase capital and earnings are reduced as loan losses increase. Share buybacks and dividends lower capital. The stress-tested banks are required to suspend buybacks. But according to Brainard, allowing dividend payments now \u201craises the risk\u201d that banks \u201cwill need to tighten credit or rebuild capital during the recovery.\u201d \u201cRebuilding capital,\u201d if it were necessary, would probably mean banks would dilute the ownership stakes of current shareholders by selling more shares to the public. \u201cTemporarily halting shareholder payouts at large banks due to the COVID-19 shock would create a level playing field and allow all banks to preserve capital without suffering a competitive disadvantage relative to their peers,\u201d Brainard said.Waiting for October Christopher Marinac, director of research at Janney Montgomery Scott, said during an interview that the Fed\u2019s decision to \u201cgive the banks some latitude\u201d on dividends made sense, because regulators need more data on the effect of loan forbearances and other modifications on earnings. \u201cThe forbearances and deferrals are the biggest problem the industry has at the moment,\u201d he said. Even when the banks report their second-quarter results in July, information about the effect of loan deferrals won\u2019t be complete. When the banks file their quarterly 10-Q reports in early August, there will be updates on the loan modification situation as of late July. Marinac called the banks \u201ca store of value,\u201d saying they were leading the pandemic relief efforts, in contrast to their position in the 2008 credit crisis, when they were \u201cpart of the problem.\u201d The banks were well-prepared for the current crisis, \u201cwith less leverage, more capital and less concentration\u201d of credit risk, he said. Looking ahead, the consensus among analysts is for large banks\u2019 earnings to improve. \u201cIf we fail to achieve that reduction in loss costs that analysts are forecasting, estimates are too high and dividends could be at risk for many more banks,\u201d Shanahan said. Odeon Capital senior research analyst Richard Bove took a negative tone, writing in a note to clients on June 26 that the Fed\u2019s actions indicate \u201ca number of banks must sharply reduce their payouts.\u201d Bove said six banks \u201cmight unilaterally choose to reduce their dividends due to their poor scores in one of the stress tests administered by the Fed,\u201d including Ally Financial Inc. ALLY, -0.21%, Capital One Financial Corp. COF, -0.49%, Goldman Sachs GS, -0.21%, Citizens Financial Group Inc. CFG, -2.10%, Regions Financial Corp. RF, -1.91% and Truist Financial Corp. TFC, +0.34%."}]}
