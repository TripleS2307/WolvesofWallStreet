According to Shane Parrish of the popular Farnam Street blog, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all part of the plan: \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098You have to be willing to look like an idiot in the short term to get the best long-term results. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d suggest that because the future has become increasingly uncertain, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s preparing for the widest range of possible futures.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how Parrish, hailed as \u00e2\u0080\u009cWall Street\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest influencer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d described Buffett\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current investment strategy in a recent interview with Business Insider. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand with a certain degree of certainty, you sit out until you do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Parrish added, addressing criticism that Buffett has raised cash when he should be taking a more active role in profiting from the chaos. Read: Warren Buffett may have found a stock he likes \u00e2\u0080\u0094 his own Parrish, who has hundreds of thousands of Twitter TWTR, -0.23% followers and has interviewed some of the biggest names on Wall Street, has been obsessed with Buffett for years. His blog is named after the street address of Berkshire\u00e2\u0080\u0099s corporate headquarters. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBuffett has taught me to be conscious about happiness, be conscious about being optimistic about the future based on the past, and just constantly having a smile and having fun with life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Parrish once wrote in a post about Buffett\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impact on his life beyond just investing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not about being purely rational about every minute of your day and optimizing your time. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about living life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And with that, Parrish said he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s confident in the direction Berkshire is headed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople always seem to want the optimal solution for the moment, and thus he ends up looking out of touch at times,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Parrish, a longtime attendee of Berkshire\u00e2\u0080\u0099s annual meeting, told Business Insider. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you have to be willing to do something different to get different results.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Read: Diversify?

But Parrish said Buffett is still focused on protecting his investors and keeping plenty of that cash on hand to help navigate the ups and downs of this treacherous climate. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t win if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t finish... you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t compound if you zero out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Parrish said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn periods of high uncertainty, you want to ensure you have the most possible options.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Or, as Parrish put it in a tweet last month: iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Cash looks to be a decent place to be heading into the new, earnings-heavy week, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% \u00c2 , S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39% all leaning lower early in Monday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s session."}]}
