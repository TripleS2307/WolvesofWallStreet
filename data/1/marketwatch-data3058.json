Apple shares AAPL, +1.74% \u00c2 powered to another record high Friday, with the stock crossing the $400 mark for the first time and eventually gaining 10.5% as analysts cheered the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009camazingly strong\u00e2\u0080\u009d earnings results. The smartphone giant easily weathered the pandemic in its June quarter, according to a Thursday announcement, delivering revenue of $59.7 billion that came in comfortably above estimates even from earlier this year, before analysts slashed their forecasts to account for closed stores, weaker budgets, and other impacts from COVID-19.

Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar took a similar view. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOverall, the pandemic seems to be having a limited impact on Apple,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said in a note to clients. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn fact, one can make the case that the Mac and iPad are actually benefiting nicely due to the work from home and distance learning trends.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mac revenue rose to $7.1 billion from $5.8 billion, while iPad revenue increased to $6.6 billion from $5 billion. Kumar keyed in on the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expectation for a strong back-to-school season this year and upped his price target to $450 from $310 while maintaining an overweight rating on the stock. RBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Muller wrote that the iPhone SE helped Apple drive a new high for its installed base, contributing to smartphone trends that make him \u00e2\u0080\u009ccontinue to gain confidence behind Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to drive recurring cash flows from its loyal customer base.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Muller is optimistic about smartphone trends over the next few quarters even as Apple confirmed that its next phone will be delayed by \u00e2\u0080\u009ca few weeks\u00e2\u0080\u009d compared with last year, when it began selling its new models toward the end of September. That will push the next iPhone release into Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next fiscal year, which begins in October. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRecall that iPhone X, a highly anticipated form factor upgrade, was released in early November and drove a still-record quarterly iPhone revenue result,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDespite anticipation of a 5G upgrade, Apple expects recent iPhone performance (which topped expectations) will continue through next quarter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He rates the stock at outperform while raising his price target to $445 from $390.

Morgan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Samik Chatterjee wrote that Apple \u00e2\u0080\u009csurprised even bullish expectations heading into F3Q/C2Q earnings by hardly missing a beat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and he was upbeat about management\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tone in looking at the current quarter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll in all, Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability as a company in a consumer discretionary product segment to completely buck sequential slowdown in F3Q/C2Q despite the massive disruption speaks volumes to the utility associated by consumers to the products as well as the momentum of a product cycle, which is leading them to be willing to circumvent the traditional practice of buying from the physical channel when required, and leads us to be more optimistic relative to the upcoming 5G product cycle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d wrote Chatterjee, who has an overweight rating on the stock and who bumped his price target up to $460 from $425. Chatterjee said that Apple also has an \u00e2\u0080\u009cunderappreciated enterprise opportunity\u00e2\u0080\u009d as more people use Macs and iPads for remote work. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile the strength in the quarter was expected, led by management\u00e2\u0080\u0099s guidance on the last earnings call, the guidance for unit growth trends to sustain into F4Q are likely to surprise investors given that most were likely expecting it to be a one-time tailwind for these products,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote. Canaccord Genuity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s T. Michael Walkley also was encouraged that the company expects double-digit growth for all hardware categories except the iPhone in the September quarter, and he praised the \u00e2\u0080\u009cblowout\u00e2\u0080\u009d results for the June period while boosting his price target to $460 from $440 and keeping a buy rating on the stock.
