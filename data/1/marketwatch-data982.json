The recent nationwide protests over police killings of Black Americans have sparked calls for the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee to select a Black running mate. Biden on July 20 said that four Black women are in fact on his shortlist for vice president. At the same time, social-distancing measures due to the coronavirus pandemic have prevented Biden from holding big campaign rallies and other events. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith little traditional campaigning covered in the news, the choice of Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vice president is garnering outsized attention,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Melissa K. Miller, a professor of political science at Bowling Green State University in Ohio. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more, the 77-year-old politician\u00e2\u0080\u0099s age has prompted questions about whether he would serve two terms as president and put extra focus on his choice for vice president. If he defeats President Donald Trump in the November election, Biden would be 78 when he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sworn into office and rank as the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s oldest-ever commander-in-chief, topping Ronald Reagan, who was 77 when he left office and 69 when he entered the White House. Trump is now 73 and was 70 at his swearing-in, so the Republican incumbent currently rates as the oldest president at the start of his time in office. Some party activists also \u00e2\u0080\u009cwonder whether a carefully chosen vice president could swing the presidential pendulum back in the Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 favor\u00e2\u0080\u009d after Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s razor-thin margins of victory in 2016 in the battleground states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, Miller said. But she cautioned that while research suggests running mates are \u00e2\u0080\u009cchosen in order to maximize the ticket\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chances of winning,\u00e2\u0080\u009d other research suggests the choice has \u00e2\u0080\u009clittle demonstrable effect on who wins in November.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Related:Biden holds 15-point lead over Trump in new national poll And see:\u00e2\u0080\u0098We have polls that show me leading in almost every swing state,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Trump says Biden said in late July that he would make his decision on his running mate in the first week of August, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expected to reveal his pick this week. The former vice president, who pledged in March that he would choose a woman as his vice president, said at a virtual fund-raising event on May 27 that he wants a No. 2 who \u00e2\u0080\u009cis simpatico with me\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009chas some qualities that I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t possess.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to agree with me on everything, but they have to have the same basic approach to how we handle the economy and how we handle everything,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2 Biden said at that May event. Former Democratic presidential hopeful Kamala Harris \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the senator from California who attacked Biden over school busing at a debate a year ago \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is currently the favorite in betting markets, helped by the view that a Black former attorney general could be just what voters want at this moment. Biden was photographed in late July with handwritten notes about Harris. Related:Politicians have supported heavily armed police task forces \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with underwhelming outcomes But one veteran pollster has said another former Democratic presidential hopeful \u00e2\u0080\u0094 progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is the \u00e2\u0080\u009cobvious\u00e2\u0080\u009d choice for the more-moderate Biden, arguing that selecting her provides the clearest and easiest way to unite their party. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss:With Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s VP choice expected soon, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s who he could pick The U.S. stock market SPX, +0.87% \u00c2 DJIA, +0.56% \u00c2 might be shaken if Biden announces Warren as his running mate. An RBC survey of institutional investors last year showed they were growing anxious when she was performing well in the Democratic presidential race. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBiden has been talking about progressive policy change now more than he has in the past,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Larry Jacobs, director of the University of Minnesota\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Center for the Study of Politics and Governance. Jacobs added that the coronavirus causing the disease COVID-19, the economic downturn and racial disparities have \u00e2\u0080\u009call rocked America\u00e2\u0080\u009d and may convince Biden that he needs to push for government activism and higher taxes.\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWarren would accent that policy agenda and its threat to Wall Street,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the University of Minnesota expert, who also told MarketWatch that stocks \u00e2\u0080\u009cmay well respond with good reason to the choice of Warren.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But Miller, the Bowling Green professor, said she expects Biden will prioritize race over progressive politics in his choice for VP. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because \u00e2\u0080\u009caiming to generate African-American turnout is the safer bet\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and because, at this point, an all-white Democratic ticket looks like \u00e2\u0080\u009ca nonstarter among a broad swath of voters,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to Miller. When it comes to who is most likely to be picked, she said her top five consists of Rep. Val Demings of Florida, previously Orlando\u00e2\u0080\u0099s police chief, as well as Harris, former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and former national-security adviser Susan Rice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cInstitutional racism, criminal-justice reform and policing reform will remain key issues through November,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Miller said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAppointing someone who can speak powerfully to those issues would send an important message to voters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Related:Abrams says it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0098critical\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to show Black Americans that coronavirus won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hold up voting And see:Harris blasts stalling of anti-lynching bill Sarita McCoy Gregory, who chairs the department of political science and history at Hampton University in Virginia, said her top five is \u00e2\u0080\u009ca bit more aspirational and reflects my hope that the Biden team is paying attention to the current demands for nationwide police reform and the need to excite and unify the Democratic Party base.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Her list doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t include Demings and Harris because she views the former \u00e2\u0080\u009ctop cops\u00e2\u0080\u009d as \u00e2\u0080\u009cnonstarters\u00e2\u0080\u009d amid widespread calls for reform and the Black Lives Matter movement, Gregory said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe they will rally the energy and enthusiasm needed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. Instead, Gregory said her top five includes Rice and Rep. Barbara Lee of California, who \u00e2\u0080\u009chas solid progressive politics that would excite the Sanders wing and the West Coast.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It also includes Abrams as well as former Flint, Mich., Mayor Karen Weaver, who \u00e2\u0080\u009cushered her city through the worst water crisis in the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and Rep. Lucy McBath of Georgia, whose story \u00e2\u0080\u009cresonates with this current political moment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d McBath ran for Congress after losing her 17-year-old son in a shooting.Other twists in the \u00e2\u0080\u0098veepstakes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 However, Biden could be focused in large part on selecting a running mate who would work well with him in Washington, according to Jacobs, the University of Minnesota expert. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust about everyone is viewing the VP pick as geared to \u00e2\u0080\u0098winning\u00e2\u0080\u0099 votes and the election, whereas Biden is mostly viewing the choice as whether the person fits his style, policy and need for help governing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jacobs said. He said running mates are \u00e2\u0080\u009cnearly forgotten\u00e2\u0080\u009d by October, and starting with Walter Mondale, the Democratic challenger to Reagan in 1984, every presidential candidate since him has picked their VP \u00e2\u0080\u009cbased on policy/governing fit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Past White House hopefuls have handled \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe age or the health issue by putting somebody a heartbeat away who would be viewed as a plausible president,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Joel Goldstein, a law professor emeritus at Saint Louis University in Missouri who has written two books on the vice presidency. He cited Reagan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s picking George H.W. Bush and the selection by Bob Dole, the GOP challenger to Bill Clinton in 1996, of Jack Kemp, who was a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpresidential-caliber figure in the Republican Party.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cBiden, of course, has said that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s his main criteria \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that the person has to be ready to step in on Day One. So that would lead to the expectation that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accepting responsibility to pick somebody who would be perceived as being presidential, which would suggest more of a Bush or a Kemp analogy than a young up-and-comer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Goldstein added, referring to older presidential candidates who picked more youthful running mates, such as John McCain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s selection of Sarah Palin in 2008. The Saint Louis professor also warned there are still probably more twists ahead in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cveepstakes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt this point, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be pretty confident that Biden doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know who he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to pick \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and that the political context could change dramatically between now and the beginning of August,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.
