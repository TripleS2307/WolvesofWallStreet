John Elias, a member of the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, told the House Judiciary Committee in prepared testimony that the investigations were carried out even after staffers had determined that the cannabis business is highly fragmented with many market participants in the states that have legalized cannabis. Read Elias\u2019 statement. Mergers are usually only subjected to antitrust investigations if they are likely to have an impact on competition or create a monopoly. \u201cWhile these were nominally antitrust investigations, and used antitrust investigative authorities, they were not bona fide antitrust investigations,\u201d said Elias. \u201cNonetheless, they accounted for 29% of the Antitrust Division\u2019s full-review merger investigations in Fiscal Year 2019.\u201d The testimony is part of the committee\u2019s probe into whether the Justice Department under Barr has been improperly politicized. Elias and Aaron Zelinsky, a career Justice Department prosecutor, were subpoenaed by House Democrats to testify. Zelinsky worked on cases as part of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, including the case against Roger Stone, an ally of President Donald Trump. See now:Career prosecutor set to tell Congress that Trump ally Roger Stone got special treatment from the Justice Department Elias explained that the antitrust division\u2019s manual instructs staffers to first look at market share as an indicator of whether a deal needs to get routine clearance or be subjected to the fullest review, by issuing what is called a \u201cSecond Request\u201d subpoena. Typically, a company would need at least double-digit market share to merit that subpoena, which can lead to demands for hundreds of thousands or even millions of documents.

The prosecutor said in the case of a review of a proposed merger between cannabis retailer MedMen Enterprises Inc. and PharmaCann LLC, staffers found the deal did not raise any significant competitive concerns. But on March 5, 2019, Barr called the antitrust division leadership to his office and ordered them to issue Second Request subpoenas. The division went ahead and did so and said the reason was that it had not \u201cevaluated this industry before.\u201d \u201cThis rationale \u2014 standing alone, without reference to a competition problem \u2014 is not described in the Merger Guidelines as a basis for investigating a transaction,\u201d said Elias. The companies were then asked to provide 1.3 million documents from the files of 40 employees. The investigation then found that the markets were indeed \u201cunconcentrated\u201d and was closed without enforcement action. By then, however, the deal had collapsed with MedMen citing delays in obtaining regulatory approval. The company\u2019s stock price had lost about a third of its value while the investigation was being conducted.

When prosecutors brought their concerns to the head of the Antitrust Division, Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, he responded by saying the investigations were motivated \u201cby the fact that the cannabis industry is unpopular \u2018on the fifth floor,\u2019\u201d a reference to Barr\u2019s offices in the DOJ headquarters building. \u201cPersonal dislike of the industry is not a proper basis upon which to ground an antitrust investigation,\u201d said Elias. Barr said in April of 2019 that he would \u201cfavor one uniform federal rule against marijuana but, if there is not sufficient consensus to obtain that, then I think the way to go is to permit a more federal approach so states can make their own decisions within the framework of the federal law and so we\u2019re not just ignoring the enforcement of federal law,\u201d he said. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. MedMen shares MMNFF, +0.84% were last trading at 23 cents, and have lost 56.5% in 2020 to date.
