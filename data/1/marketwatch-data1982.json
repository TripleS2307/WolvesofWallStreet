Until last week, the CDC had also been recommending a two-week quarantine for those traveling between states or from overseas, but guidelines updated Monday no longer include that recommendation. \"We're not going to follow the CDC guidance,\" Gov. Andrew Cuomo said during a conference call with reporters on Wednesday. \"It is the exact opposite of what the CDC has been saying.\" The governor urged New Yorkers to follow state guidance on quarantine. The CDC website indicates travelers should \"follow state, territorial, tribal and local recommendations or requirements after travel.\" The updated guidelines also added new recommendations as to who should be tested. People who may have been exposed to the virus but have not shown symptoms no longer need a test, according to the CDC website. The governor said the health organization had \"reversed its guidance\" on this issue, as well. \"I've spoken to health experts from around the globe,\" Cuomo explained. \"None of them will say that this makes any sense from a health point of view.\" See: Health experts express alarm at CDC change in testing guidelines that exclude asymptomatic patients Cuomo also announced that the infection rate in New York state was under 1% for the 19th day in a row. It was 0.79% on Tuesday, bringing the total number of reported cases up to 431,340. Three people died on Tuesday from the virus."}]}
