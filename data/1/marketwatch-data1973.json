Over 80 men and women worth seven figures from the U.S., U.K., Germany, New Zealand, Canada and the Netherlands calling themselves the \u201cMillionaires for Humanity\u201d have signed an open letter asking their governments to \u201craise taxes on people like us. Immediately. Substantially. Permanently.\u201d \u201c \u201cSo please. Tax us. Tax us. Tax us. It is the right choice. It is the only choice.\u201d \u201d The signatories include Walt Disney Co. DIS, +1.53% heiress Abigail Disney, Ben & Jerry\u2019s co-founder Jerry Greenfield, former BlackRock managing director Morris Pearl and \u201cLove, Actually\u201d director Richard Curtis. Some, like Disney and Pearl, are also members of the \u201cPatriotic Millionaires\u201d club, a couple hundred ultra-wealthy Americans who have pushed to be taxed more to help close the wealth gap.

They add that 70% of health care workers are women, and most essential workers are \u201cgrossly underpaid\u201d while putting themselves and their families at risk of contracting the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 every day. \u201cUnlike tens of millions of people around the world, we do not have to worry about losing our jobs, our homes, or our ability to support our families. We are not fighting on the frontlines of this emergency and we are much less likely to be its victims,\u201d the millionaires write. \u201cBut we do have money, lots of it,\u201d they add. \u201cMoney that is desperately needed now and will continue to be needed in the years ahead, as our world recovers from this crisis.\u201d Coronavirus update: Global case tally edges toward 13 million, and Florida trounces one-day case record set by California last week It should be noted that these millionaires can cut a check for coronavirus relief at any time, of course. Microsoft MSFT, +2.48% founder and philanthropist Bill Gates and Twitter TWTR, -0.23% CEO Jack Dorsey have pledged more than $1 billion to vaccine research and COVID-19 relief efforts. Amazon AMZN, +3.01% founder Jeff Bezos donated $100 million to Feeding America, although the online shopping giant has also been slammed for how it\u2019s handled the safety of its warehouse workers during the pandemic. The \u201cMillionaires for Humanity\u201d argue that charity alone can\u2019t get us through this crisis, however. \u201cGovernment leaders must take the responsibility for raising the funds we need and spending them fairly,\u201d they claim. \u201cWe can ensure we adequately fund our health systems, schools, and security through a permanent tax increase on the wealthiest people on the planet, people like us.\u201d As of early Monday afternoon, 12.9 million people have been infected with COVID-19 worldwide, and 569,878 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Millions of Americans are out of work. Worldwide, it\u2019s estimated that 1.3 billion children were pulled out of school as the pandemic spread \u2014 and nearly 370 million of them depend on school meals."}]}
