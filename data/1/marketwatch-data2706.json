She joins a growing list that includes Miles Taylor, former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security, and former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci. Troye, Pence\u2019s former homeland-security adviser, says in a new video released Thursday by the group Republican Voters Against Trump that working for Trump was \u201cterrifying\u201d and that he was more concerned about his re-election chances than about protecting the nation from the virus. Coronavirus daily update:Global cases near 30 million; Trump contradicts CDC head on vaccine timetable and again derides face masks \u201cThe truth is he doesn\u2019t actually care about anyone else but himself,\u201d she says. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Troye alleges that, during one task force meeting that she attended, the president told the room that, \u201c \u2018Maybe this COVID thing is a good thing. I don\u2019t like shaking hands with people. I don\u2019t have to shake hands with these disgusting people.\u2019 \u201d Vice President Mike Pence, here speaking at an April coronavirus briefing in the James Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House, characterized former homeland-security aide Olivia Troye as \u201cone more disgruntled employee that has decided to play politics.\u201d Associated Press \u201cThose disgusting people are the same people that he claims to care about. These are the people still going to his rallies today who have complete faith in who he is,\u201d she says. \u201cIf the president had taken this virus seriously, or if he had actually made an effort to tell how serious it was, he would have slowed the virus spread, he would have saved lives.\u201d Troye, a lifelong Republican, said she plans to vote for Trump\u2019s Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, in November. The White House denied the exchange had happened, with White House spokesperson Judd Deere saying \u201cher assertions have no basis in reality and are flat-out inaccurate.\u201d He further dismissed Troye as \u201cdisgruntled\u201d and said she generally watched task-force meetings from an overflow staff room and was never in private meetings with the president. \u201cMs. Troye is a former detailee and a career Department of Homeland Security staff member, who is disgruntled that her detail was cut short because she was no longer capable of keeping up with her day-to-day duties,\u201d added Keith Kellogg, Pence\u2019s national-security adviser, who said Troye reported to him and never once expressed concern about the administration\u2019s response. Pence also pushed back at the White House, saying he hadn\u2019t read her comments, \u201cbut it reads to me like one more disgruntled employee that has decided to play politics during election year.\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t be more proud of the work we\u2019ve done,\u201d he added. Trump himself told journalist Bob Woodward in recorded interviews that he intentionally downplayed the virus in public comments even though he was fully aware of the danger it posed. He is also a self-described germaphobe and denounced the practice of shaking hands before he ran for office. Republican Voters Against Trump is one of several groups trying to convince Republicans and others who once supported the president that they should vote for Biden. \u201cNever before have so many high-ranking staffers of an incumbent president opposed his reelection and endorsed his opponent,\u201d said Sarah Longwell, the strategic director of Republican Voters Against Trump, in a statement.
