Getty Images The Trump administration might be able to extend the federal moratorium on tenant evictions unilaterally, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday. Pelosi\u2019s comments came as an agreement struck Tuesday \u2014 to try to work out the framework for another stimulus package by the week\u2019s end that could be turned into legislation next week \u2014 appeared to fray, with both sides raising doubts about the likelihood of that happening.

White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin put the moratorium and reviving a federal add-on payment to state jobless benefits at the top of their to-do list when they began face-to-face talks with Democratic leaders last week. \u201cHe may be able to extend the moratorium on evictions, but unless you have some money with that, it\u2019s helpful but it\u2019s not the whole thing,\u201d Pelosi said in a televised interview Wednesday on MSNBC. Pelosi met with Mnuchin and Meadows on Tuesday and they confirmed then the White House was looking at what actions it could take on the moratorium and the unemployment payments through executive orders or other means without congressional approval. \u201cAgain, you can\u2019t do the money without the Congress of the United States. The power of the purse begins in the House,\u201d Pelosi said. HUD has already extended one anti-eviction deadline included in the CARES Act. In June, the department said it was extending the moratorium on foreclosures and evictions for homeowners with Federal Housing Administration-insured single family mortgages. The recently expired moratorium deadline applied to residents in public housing, using federal housing vouchers and in FHA-insured multifamily buildings. Meadows, speaking on CNN, said President Donald Trump would use his executive authority to help the jobless and people at risk of being evicted if he has to. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is by Friday, if we haven\u2019t made significant progress and we\u2019re too far apart, the president is prepared to take executive action,\u201d Meadows said. \u201cWe believe that we can address those two things,\u201d Meadows said, citing what he called \u201cflexibility\u201d provided in the CARES Act as well as \u201cthe executive privilege that the president enjoys broadly.\u201d Meadows later told a group of reporters at the U.S. Capitol that when Democratic leaders Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer agreed with Mnuchin and him to try to get a deal done by the week\u2019s end, that was seen as Friday. But he was pessimistic about progress if nothing is agreed to by then. Pelosi herself appeared to backtrack somewhat on Friday as a drop-dead date. \u201cI do believe that we have to reach an agreement,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat the timetable is really relates to the progress we make. How big will the bill be and how long will it last, those are the questions,\u201d Pelosi said."}]}
