The budget airline said the majority of the cuts would be frequency reduction rather than route closures, and will be focused on countries where the pandemic is seeing a resurgence in cases--namely Spain, France and Sweden. \"These capacity cuts and frequency reductions for the months of September and October are necessary given the recent weakness in forward bookings due to Covid-19 restrictions in a number of EU countries,\" a spokesperson said.
