E-commerce sales, which have been strong throughout the coronavirus pandemic, are expected to climb 25% to 35%, reaching $182 billion and $196 billion. Factors such as an increase in unemployment or the end of unemployment benefits could leave retail sales flat to up just 1%. Or consumer confidence could steadily increase with the passage of a pandemic relief bill or steps taken towards an effective coronavirus vaccine, which could drive sales up 2.5% to 3.5%. Deloitte's forecast brings the two scenarios together. \"Regardless of the scenario, however, the consumer's focus on health, financial concerns and safety will result in a shift in the way they spend their holiday budget,\" said Rod Sides, U.S. retail and distribution sector leader at Deloitte LLP, in a statement. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF XRT, +0.05% has gained 10.7% for the year to date. The Amplify Onine Retail ETF IBUY, +1.39% is up 67.6%. And the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% has gained 4.7% for the period."}]}
