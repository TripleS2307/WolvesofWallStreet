The Margin:Who is Deborah Birx - the doctor that both Trump and Pelosi are now suddenly criticizing? It was a rare rebuke of Birx. Trump accused her of taking \"the bait\" by responding to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who told ABC's \"This Week\" that she had lost confidence in Birx because Trump appointed her and the president has been spreading disinformation about the virus.
