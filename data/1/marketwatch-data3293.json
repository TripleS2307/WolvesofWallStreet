Asked on Tuesday what actions he could order to disrupt the occupation, Trump responded: \"About 10 different things - any one of which would solve the problem quickly.\" He said he had discussed the matter with Attorney General William Barr. Seattle's mayor, Jenny Durkan, faulted Trump in an interview with MSNBC for focusing on a four-block area in her city. \"I'm not going to be distracted by the president or anyone else,\" she said. Listening to the voices of Black Lives Matter and black Americans generally on the topic of dismantling racially unjust systems, Durkan said, would hold her attention. \"We'll deal with community, [and] we'll have a resolution.\" Seattle police pulled back from a part of the city's Capitol Hill neighborhood after recent clashes with protesters. A festival-like atmosphere quickly emerged in the area, now called the \"Capitol Hill Occupied Protest,\" or CHOP, with participants painting a Black Lives Matter mural on the street and planting a community garden. Police Chief Carmen Best spoke after a business owner near the protest area complained that police didn't respond when he called 911 to report a break-in and vandalism. \"There is no cop-free zone in the city of Seattle,\" Best said Monday. Best said officers have written multiple police reports for crimes reported in that area in the past 48 hours. She said dispatchers and officers are coordinating with crime victims or callers to meet police on the edges of the CHOP boundaries. She added that officers will go in if there's an urgent situation."}]}
