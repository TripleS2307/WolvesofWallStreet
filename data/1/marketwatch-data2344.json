Declining PC sales in recent years have led many industry prognosticators, as well, to declare the PC if not dead than dying, supplanted by tablets along with smartphones. PC sales, though, have seemingly exploded during the pandemic, thanks to bulk purchases by companies and schools that must now connect to workers and students remotely, as well as consumers who had avoided an upgrade for years. The biggest reason, according to experts: Older models were ill-equipped for videoconferencing tools such as Zoom Video Communications Inc.\u2019s ZM, +2.89% offering, which has exploded in use for videoconferencing, key for team meetings and remote classes. \u201cThe old PCs are not doing so well, they didn\u2019t have the next graphics card and other things,\u201d said Maribel Lopez, principal analyst at Lopez Research. \u201cIf you have a 4-year-old PC and you are doing videos, it\u2019s really not working. This is one reason the PC market is going gangbusters. Today\u2019s entry-level PC would be better than what you bought four years ago.\u201d IDC analyst Jitesh Urbani agreed that video was a big driver of the increase in PC demand. For more: How the boom boosted Zoom earnings and how you may use it for free but companies are paying for it \u201cAt the start of the pandemic, we heard of many instances where folks were scrambling to buy new PCs, and when they couldn\u2019t find one they would resort to using their old PCs, which often lacked a decent webcam, microphone, or other hardware features,\u201d Urbani said in an email. \u201cHowever, as video calls have essentially become mandatory, those people ultimately sought to upgrade their old PCs.\u201d The upswing in shipments began in the second quarter of the year, IDC reported, after retail channels were wiped out from early buying during the COVID-19 pandemic, which began affecting the U.S. in early March. The first quarter, when China began shutting down its factories, also saw some issues in the global supply chain that were a factor in a nearly 10% drop in worldwide PC unit shipments, according to IDC. But demand picked up as supply became more available, and consumers better recognized the nature and duration of working from home. Worldwide PC unit shipments surged 11.2% in the second quarter, according to IDC. On the other hand, the smartphone market moved in the opposite direction. In the second quarter, IDC said global smartphone unit shipments plunged 17%. Apple Inc.\u2019s AAPL, +1.74% third-quarter results showed these trends, with only a very slight uptick of 1.6% in iPhone revenue, while the iPad tablet experienced a major resurgence, with revenue jumping 31%, and sales of the Mac climbed nearly 22%, in the quarter that ended July 30. Laptops are clearly the biggest beneficiary of the pandemic\u2019s tech trends, especially in many households where the work situation is fluid, with a dad in the home office and a mom working at a makeshift desk in the kitchen or dining room, while also trying to help one child with homework on yet another separate computer or tablet, and then moving to another room later in the day. \u201cMany people don\u2019t have a dedicated office,\u201d Alex Cho, president of the PC business at HP Inc. HPQ, told MarketWatch. \u201cPeople are working around the house a lot. They are mobile in the house. \u2026 They are also sharing resources, including the couch, the number of people working in a bedroom and network bandwidth.\u201d IDC also noted strong growth for Chromebooks, which are particularly popular in education. Lopez noted that the devices, which run on an Alphabet Inc. operating system, are also being used by call-center employees who cannot store any consumer data on devices in their homes. They are now often working with a Chromebook or some other type of virtual desktop interface, so that all their work goes to the cloud, sometimes via a legacy app in a mainframe that is designed as cloud-first. Cho said that HP has been getting feedback from customers, partners and employees about their working situations and how they could be improved. Trying to avoid neck pain from slouching over a laptop, many have been using thick books to raise their devices. \u201cWe are getting pictures of people\u2019s home environments,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not realize how much work is happening in the bedroom, in the garage.\u201d More from Therese Poletti: The CEO who made one of Silicon Valley\u2019s worst acquisitions wants a $400 million blank check HP and other PC manufacturers recently detailed the resurgence in PC sales in their quarterly earnings. In its third fiscal quarter, where overall revenue slipped 2.1%, pulled down by corporate printing, HP saw net revenue of the consumer segment of its personal systems business jump 42%, while commercial revenue fell 11%. When Lenovo Group Ltd. 992, -1.91%, the world\u2019s largest PC maker, reported its third-quarter earnings in August, it said its consumer PC segment saw revenue growth of 45%. Gianfranco Lanci, president and chief operating officer, told analysts on the company\u2019s earnings call that consumers are finding that the PC they occasionally used at home for maybe one hour or two a day \u201cis not good enough.\u201d \u201cSo it\u2019s not only people buying a new PC, but it\u2019s also people replacing a PC,\u201d he said. At Dell Technologies Inc. DELL, -0.39%, an otherwise lackluster quarter, where overall revenue fell 3%, saw its biggest revenue gain in the consumer segment. Consumer revenue was $3.2 billion, up 18%, driven by the double-digit growth across consumer notebooks and gaming systems. Dell\u2019s higher-end consumer PCs, the XPS, and its Alienware gaming systems saw combined growth of 25%. The company, though, did forecast that it expected its fourth fiscal quarter would be down more than normal on a sequential basis. Jeff Clarke, Dell\u2019s chief operating officer and vice chairman, told analysts that the gains in consumer sales have been largely education-driven. \u201cThat is largely lower-end ASPs [average selling prices] that are associated with [the education market],\u201d he said on the company\u2019s conference call.

Both IDC and Gartner Inc. predict that the growth will be short-lived, but their predictions as to how long it will last diverge. \u201cIt is likely that the surging laptop and tablet demands will be short-term, and not sustainable in the long term,\u201d said Mikako Kitagawa, a Gartner analyst. \u201cOnce the devices are distributed to these who need [them], then the demand will slow down significantly. This will most likely happen in 2021.\u201d IDC\u2019s Lopez said she believes demand will remain stable for the rest of this year but will \u201cfall off the cliff\u201d in the first quarter of 2021. IDC said in a forecast last week that the overall market for desktops, notebooks and workstations will grow 3.3% in 2020 and decline 7.5% in 2021. HP is trying to take advantage of the demand while it can, but Cho also observed that the company had seen a resurgence in interest in PCs even before the pandemic forced everyone to work from home, particularly among Gen Z. Once again, \u201cthe PC is essential,\u201d Cho said."}]}
