TWTR, -0.23% is suspending Donald Trump Jr.'s Twitter account for 12 hours after the president's son shared a video showing doctors touting hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 treatment. There was initial hope that the anti-malaria drug could help in the treatment of COVID-19 patients but the Food and Drug Administration has recently cautioned against its usage in COVID-19 patients due to health risks. Social-media companies including Facebook Inc. FB, +0.26%, Twitter and Alphabet Inc.'s GOOGL, +1.82% GOOG, +1.97% YouTube began pulling the viral video, which was shared by many accounts, including that of President Donald Trump. Twitter said it would be limiting account features for Trump Jr.'s account during the 12-hour suspension, meaning he will be unable to send tweets, retweet posts, follow users, or like messages. The company cited its policy that requires \"the removal of content that may pose a risk to people's health, including content that goes directly against guidance from authoritative sources of global and local public health information\" in a notice sent to Trump Jr., which was shared by his spokesperson and then discussed by Twitter's own communications-focused account. \"Per the screenshot, the Tweet requires deletion because it violates our rules (sharing misinformation on COVID-19), and the account will have limited functionality for 12 hours,\" the @TwitterComms account said. Twitter shares are up 1.1% in Tuesday's session and they're up 29% over the past three months as the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% has risen 13%."}]}
