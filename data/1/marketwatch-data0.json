The nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates confirmed Friday that the Oct. 15 faceoff would be scrapped. The decision was made a day after the commission announced the debate would take place \u201cvirtually\u201d because Trump had contracted the coronavirus. Trump balked at holding the debate in that format, and Biden scheduled a town hall with ABC News for that night once Trump said he would not participate. Trump\u2019s team later countered with a call to hold the debates as scheduled once the president\u2019s doctor said he would be cleared to hold public events beginning on Saturday. But the commission said it would not reverse its decision not to have the candidates on stage together, citing an abundance of caution with health concerns \u2014 particularly for the town-hall-style debate that was set to feature questions from average voters. The third debate, scheduled for Oct. 22 in Nashville is still on."}]}
