The civil lawsuit in Washington\u2019s federal court follows warnings from President Donald Trump that Bolton could face a \u201ccriminal problem\u201d if he doesn\u2019t halt plans to publish the book, which is scheduled for release next week. The complaint is the latest salvo in a contentious relationship between Trump and the hawkish Bolton, who was abruptly forced from the White House in January after repeated disagreements on national security matters. It moves their rift into court, where a judge will be asked to decide whether Bolton short-circuited proper procedures to get his book on the market \u2014 something his lawyer has strongly denied. In its lawsuit, the Justice Department administration contends that the former adviser did not complete a pre-publication review to ensure that the manuscript did not contain classified material. It requests that a federal court order Bolton to \u201cinstruct or request\u201d that his publisher further delay publication of the book to allow for a completion of the national security review process and to \u201cretrieve and dispose\u201d of existing copies in a manner acceptable to the government. The Justice Department also is asking a federal court to grant it the rights to all proceeds Bolton earns from the publication of the book. Bolton\u2019s attorney, Chuck Cooper, has said Bolton worked for months with classification specialists to avoid releasing classified material. He has accused the White House of using national security information as a pretext to censor Bolton. In its lawsuit, the Justice Department argues that Bolton\u2019s job meant he \u201cregularly came into possession of some of the most sensitive classified information that exists in the U.S. government.\u201d Officials said Bolton\u2019s manuscript was more than 500 pages and was \u201crife with classified information, which he proposed to release to the world.\u201d The book contained \u201csignificant quantities of classified information that it asked Defendant to remove,\u201d the filing says. \u201cThe United States is not seeking to censor any legitimate aspect of Defendant\u2019s manuscript; it merely seeks an order requiring Defendant to complete the prepublication review process and to take all steps necessary to ensure that only a manuscript that has been officially authorized through that process \u2014 and is thus free of classified information \u2014 is disseminated publicly,\u201d the lawsuit says. Bolton\u2019s book, \u201cThe Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir,\u201d was supposed to be released in March. Its release date was twice delayed and it is now set to be released next week by publisher Simon & Schuster, a unit of ViacomCBS Inc. VIAC, -2.34% . \u201cBolton covers an array of topics \u2014 chaos in the White House, sure, but also assessments of major players, the president\u2019s inconsistent, scattershot decision-making process, and his dealings with allies and enemies alike, from China, Russia, Ukraine, North Korea, Iran, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany,\u201d according to the publisher. \u201cI am hard-pressed to identify any significant Trump decision during my tenure that wasn\u2019t driven by reelection calculations,\u201d Bolton writes in the book, according to a news release from the publisher. The book has been highly anticipated for months, especially after news broke during President Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment trial that the manuscript offered a vivid account of the president\u2019s efforts to withhold military aid from Ukraine in exchange for the country assisting with investigations into Trump\u2019s political rival Joe Biden. Those allegations formed the crux of the impeachment case, which ended with the president\u2019s Senate acquittal in February. Cooper did not immediately return an email seeking comment on the lawsuit. He has previously said that he sent Bolton\u2019s manuscript to White House classification specialist Ellen Knight in late December and that Knight and Bolton spent nearly four months going through the nearly 500-page book multiple times, \u201coften line by line.\u201d In a statement Tuesday, the American Civil Liberties Union said the lawsuit is \u201cdoomed to fail.\u201d Ben Wizner, the director of the organization\u2019s speech, technology and privacy project, said the Supreme Court had rejected a half-century ago the Nixon administration\u2019s efforts to block the release of the Pentagon Papers, and said it is well-established that prior restraints on publication are unconstitutional. \u201cAs usual, the government\u2019s threats have nothing to do with safeguarding national security, and everything to do with avoiding scandal and embarrassment,\u201d Wizner said."}]}
