The randomized study, which is being conducted by the University of Oxford, is testing dexamethasone as part of a larger trial evaluating multiple potential treatments for COVID-19. About 2,100 patients received a low dose of dexamethasone for ten days; another 4,300 patients received the standard of care. Though the steroid reduced death in ventilated and oxygen-receiving patients, it did not benefit patients with COVID-19 who did not require respiratory support. The trial's steering committee had halted enrollment in the dexamethasone arm on March 8. Oxford researchers said in a news release that they plan to publish the full clinical details \"as soon as possible.\" \"Dexamethasone is the first drug to be shown to improve survival in COVID-19,\" Dr. Peter Horby, a chief investigator for the study, said in the news release. \"The survival benefit is clear and large in those patients who are sick enough to require oxygen treatment.\" In the U.S., Gilead Sciences Inc.'s GILD, +0.82% remdesivir is one of the few treatments to have an emergency use authorization as a COVID-19 therapy. The Food and Drug Administration on Monday revoked emergency authorizations granted in March to hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, two decades-old malaria drugs."}]}
