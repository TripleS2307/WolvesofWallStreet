Be warned: You may be asked to sign a coronavirus liability waiver", "body": "Where\u2019s my mask and hand sanitizer? Can I get curbside assistance? These are some of the questions people face before performing even basic tasks and activities in the new version of normalcy during a global pandemic. Increasingly, they also have to ask themselves, \u2018Should I sign this liability waiver?\u2019 As more states ease social distancing rules in reopening, these liability releases are popping up in some salons, restaurants, gyms and other establishments trying to guard themselves against a lawsuit blaming them for a coronavirus infection. The releases are also being used at political rallies. Above the link to register for tickets to President Donald Trump\u2019s Tulsa, Okla. campaign event on Saturday, potential attendees find language saying they are taking on \u201call risks related to exposure to COVID-19\u201d and won\u2019t hold the campaign legally responsible for any illness or injury. It\u2019s always been a serious step to potentially sign away a right to sue. Waivers have been around for years, covering everything from a gym membership to a child\u2019s trampoline party. But the decision has more weight than ever, as people decide how much risk they want to take on during the outbreak. Generally, liability waivers \u201care part of our lives and part of mainstream,\u201d said Chas Rampenthal, attorney assist segment leader at LegalZoom. But these COVID-19 liability waivers are \u201cunique in that we are not really sure it can be enforceable.\u201d Republican federal lawmakers have been pushing to give businesses liability protection from lawsuits over coronavirus exposure and the issue could become a part of another relief bill. But rather than wait for court decisions or legislation on coronavirus waivers, here\u2019s what to consider the next time one is handed to you. What should I look out for with these waivers? There\u2019s no set formula on the wording for a COVID-19 liability waiver, experts say \u2014 but it should be specific and in clear language, they add. A waiver might touch on three points, said Rampenthal, who signed one when recently attending an open house. One point may specify the customer is forgoing a chance to sue the business for a future coronavirus infection. Another point will make it clear they are assuming risk and a third point may ask the customer to affirm they\u2019re in good health. Don\u2019t miss:Asymptomatic coronavirus transmission appears worse than SARS or influenza \u2014 a runner can leave a \u2018slipstream\u2019 of 30 feet \u201cThe hallmarks of a great [waiver] are you actually understand the words,\u201d said Rampenthal. LegalZoom offers templates on some documents, but not for a COVID-19 waiver, he noted. A waiver should also be specific about the government health standards the company is trying to follow, said Gary Martin Hays, an Atlanta-based lawyer representing plaintiffs in personal injury cases. That way, a consumer can know the standards a business is held to, he said. The waiver also shouldn\u2019t stop a health insurer from paying for medical coverage if someone contracts COVID-19, Hays added. A waiver isn\u2019t a free pass for a business A signed waiver doesn\u2019t shield businesses from intentionally wrong or reckless conduct, or gross negligence, said Hays. In fact, a business still has a responsibility to take \u201creasonable steps\u201d to protect customers and employees, said Elizabeth Milito, senior executive counsel at the National Federation of Independent Business. The trade association for small businesses isn\u2019t suggesting all businesses use a waiver and it isn\u2019t offering boiler-plate language, she said. It\u2019s a case-by-case decision for every business, said Milito, noting that salon owners and a marina owner have recently asked her about the waiver. It\u2019s also a state-by-state issue, because some state courts say a liability waiver signed before an injury is null and void from the start. Louisiana, Virginia and Montana are three such states, according to Rampenthal. The most important judge is the customer making the gut check, he said. Apart from any legal consequences, Rampenthal said people still have to ask themselves, \u201cDo I want this service enough, now that I understand the risk is? Is it still worth it to me to sign this waiver?\u201d"}]}
