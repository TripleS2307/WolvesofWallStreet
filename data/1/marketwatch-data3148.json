AMZN, +3.01% surged 1.9% and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, +1.82% rose 0.9% toward record highs in premarket trading Monday, after Mizuho analyst James Lee raises his price targets, citing the ramp in cloud spending in the financial services, retail and health care industries. Lee raised his target on Amazon's stock by 11% to $3,450 and on Alphabet's stock by 5.8% to $1,650, while keeping his buy ratings on both. \"Demand in key verticals such as financial services and retail is accelerating, for the migration to cloud,\" Lee wrote in a note to clients. \"For healthcare, which has been lagging in cloud adoption, we believe it reached an inflection point recently as hospitals are migrating to cloud due to increased demand for telemedicine, CRM and patient database management.\" Amazon's stock, which has gained in 7 of the past 8 sessions, has soared 47.5% over the past three months through Friday, while Alphabet shares, which have gained in 8 of the past 9 sessions, has run up 27.2%. In comparison, the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% has climbed 15.3% the past three months."}]}
