Trump said \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t resist a police officer\u00e2\u0080\u009d and said he heard an explanation from Garrett Rolfe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyer that the officer heard a sound like a gunshot and saw a flash in front of him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know that I would have necessarily believed that, but I will tell you, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very interesting thing and maybe that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are going to have to find out. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s up to Justice right now. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be up to Justice. I hope he gets a fair shake because police have not been treated fairly in our country. They have not been treated fairly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}]}
