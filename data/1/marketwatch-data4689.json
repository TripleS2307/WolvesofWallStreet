Pubs will be permitted to reopen on July 4. Almost as important, Johnson also relaxed social-distancing rules to one meter from two, which is important for the often-cramped sector. Gainers included JD Wetherspoon JDW, +2.99%, Marston\u2019s MARS, +20.66% and Mitchells & Butler MAB, +5.58%. Pub reopening won\u2019t be easy. Mark Brumby, principal at Langton Capital, points out social distance is \u201cvirtually unenforceable\u201d at any length. \u201cDistancing depends on the goodwill of customers, operators etc., lavatories can\u2019t function (doorways are too narrow) so there may be a touch of the Dominic Cummings about it, use your initiative,\u201d he said, in reference to the actions of the prime minister\u2019s political adviser who relocated from London during the coronavirus lockdown. Another issue is the health of pub infrastructure. \u201cPubs have not been shut for this period of time during the lifetimes of anybody involved in the industry. Cask Marque and others have issued guidance. Illness and diseases such as Legionnaire\u2019s disease are a risk if this is not handled properly.\u201d Pubs having to take the names of customers also will be a challenge, he added. The broader FTSE 100 UKX, +0.64% gained 1.4%, in line with the broader optimism in global financial markets on Monday."}]}
