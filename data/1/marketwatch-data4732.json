To get this column each market day, click here. Technically speaking, the major U.S. benchmarks are off to a constructive July start despite persistently uneven bigger-picture price action. On a headline basis, the S&P 500 has reclaimed major resistance (3,155) \u2014 rising to fill the June gap \u2014 while the Nasdaq Composite extends a more decisive July break to previously uncharted territory. Before detailing the U.S. markets\u2019 wider view, the S&P 500\u2019s US:SPX hourly chart highlights the past two weeks. As illustrated, the S&P has reclaimed major resistance (3,155), a level matching the November peak (3,154). This area pivots to first support. Separately, the index has effectively nailed additional overhead at the top of the June gap (3,181.5). Recall that a close atop gap resistance would neutralize the early-June island reversal. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average US:DJIA has nailed its range top, an area matching the early-June gap (26,294). Monday\u2019s high (26,297) and the session close (26,287) registered nearby. Separately, the blue-chip benchmark continues to challenge its 200-day moving average, currently 26,245. The prevailing retest is also detailed on the daily chart. Not surprisingly, the Nasdaq Composite US:COMP remains the strongest major benchmark. As illustrated, the index has extended a decisive break to record territory. The prevailing upturn punctuates a jagged test of the breakout point (9,838) an area better illustrated below. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has knifed to record territory, rising from a jagged retest of the breakout point (9,838). Though near-term extended, and due to consolidate, the nearly straightline July start is longer-term bullish. Overhead targets continue to project to the 10,505 and 10,610 areas, and are firmly within view. Looking elsewhere, the Dow Jones Industrial Average remains range-bound amid a persistently weaker backdrop. Still, the index has maintained a posture atop its 50-day moving average, a level that has underpinned the May and June lows. Conversely, the 200-day moving average, currently 26,245, has marked an overhead sticking point. Though Monday\u2019s close (26,287) marked the Dow\u2019s first close higher since June 10, an extended retest remains underway. Separately, the week-to-date peak (26,297) has matched gap resistance (26,294). Follow-through atop this area would mark technical progress. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has rallied atop major resistance (3,154), notching its first close higher since June 10. Separately, the prevailing upturn has tagged the top of the June gap (3,181.5). The early-week peak (3,182.6) has effectively matched gap resistance. On further strength, more distant overhead matches the 2019 close (3,230) and the June peak (3,233).The bigger picture As detailed above, the major U.S. benchmarks are off to a constructive July start. On a headline basis, the Nasdaq Composite has knifed decisively to record territory. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and Dow industrials continue to broadly trend higher, though less aggressively. Each benchmark\u2019s intermediate-term bias remains bullish. Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF has maintained major support. Tactically, its trendline tracks the 50-day moving average, currently 137.00, a level that has surpassed the breakout point (136.20). Conversely, the small-cap benchmark remains capped by its 200-day moving average, currently 146.34. More broadly, the prevailing backdrop is, perhaps strangely, not too different than that of the Dow industrials, a benchmark representing 30 of the largest U.S. companies. Similarly, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 ETF has maintained major support roughly matching the 50-day moving average. But here again, the MDY remains capped by its 200-day moving average, currently 335.12. Looking elsewhere, the SPDR Trust S&P 500 has rallied from a jagged test of its 200-day moving average. The prevailing upturn places it slightly atop gap resistance (313.00). Monday\u2019s close marked the SPY\u2019s first close higher since early June. Placing a finer point on the S&P 500, the index has reclaimed major resistance (3,155). Monday\u2019s session low (3,155) matched the inflection point to punctuate the initial breakout. More broadly, the prevailing upturn originates from the 3,000 mark, as well as a jagged test of the 200-day moving average. Conversely, the early-July peak (3,182) has matched the top of the June gap (3,181.5). Follow-through atop gap resistance would neutralize the early-June bearish island reversal. (But also note that the S&P has sustained its recovery attempt, in the broad sweep, partly defined by a series of \u201dhigher lows\u201d and \u201chigher highs.\u201d The island reversal neglected to follow-through lower after the initial early-June downdraft.) On further strength, more distant overhead matches the 2019 close (3,230) and June peak (3,233). Separately, the S&P\u2019s 50-day moving average, currently 3,018, is rising toward the 200-day moving average, currently 3,024, amid a pending golden cross. Though often a lagging indicator, the crossover will likely signal mid-week. Beyond specific levels, the S&P 500\u2019s prevailing backdrop continues to support a bullish intermediate- to longer-term bias.

These are radar screen names \u2014 sectors or stocks poised to move in the near term. For the original comments on the stocks below, see The Technical Indicator Library. Initially profiled March 19, the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF US:EEM has returned 38.6% and remains well positioned. (Yield = 2.9%.) Technically, the shares have knifed to four-month highs, rising in sympathy with China\u2019s early-week breakout. Though near-term extended, and due to consolidate, the decisive triangle breakout signals a primary trend shift. Tactically, trendline support closely matches the 200-day moving average, currently 40.52. A sustained posture higher signals a firmly-bullish bias. Moving to U.S. sectors, the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF US:SMH is acting well technically. As illustrated, the group has reached record highs, rising from a tight three-week range. A near-term target projects to the 164 area on follow-through. Conversely, trendline support closely matches the breakout point, circa 153.50, and is followed by the former range bottom (142.30). The prevailing rally attempt is intact barring a violation. Analog Devices, Inc. US:ADI is a well positioned large-cap semiconductor name. (Yield = 2.0%.) As illustrated, the shares are pressing well-defined resistance matching record territory. The prevailing five-week range is a bullish continuation pattern, hinged to the steep early-June rally. Tactically, trendline support is followed by the range bottom (115.10) and a breakout attempt is in play barring a violation. Initially profiled May 8, Salesforce.com, Inc. US:CRM has returned 12.4% and remains well positioned. Technically, the shares have staged a bull-flag breakout, reaching record highs from a tight late-June range. A near-term target projects to the 202 area on follow-through. Conversely, the breakout point (194.00) is followed by trendline support. A sustained posture higher signals a firmly-bullish bias. Finally, FedEx Corp. US:FDX is a large-cap transportation bellwether coming to life. The shares started July with a massive gap atop the 200-day moving average, rising after the company\u2019s well received quarterly results. Though still near-term extended, the strong-volume spike is longer-term bullish, and the shares are attractive on a pullback. Tactically, the June peak (150.00) is followed by a firmer floor matching the bottom of the gap (140.75) and the 200-day moving average, currently 140.82.
