(Getty Images) U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday she may keep the chamber in session, and House lawmakers in Washington, until another fiscal stimulus deal is done, raising the ante on the issue. \u201cWe are committed to staying here until we have an agreement, an agreement that meets the needs of the American people. We\u2019re optimistic that the White House at least will understand that we have to do some things,\u201d Pelosi said in an appearance on CNBC. Later, though, Pelosi\u2019s top lieutenant, Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer, said House members may simply be on call to return to Washington to vote on a bill, not necessarily staying in the capital. That was the case in August, when House lawmakers returned to their districts but were called upon to return to Washington to vote on a postal bill. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a difference\u201d between that stance and what Pelosi was referring to, Hoyer told reporters on a weekly press call. Hoyer said keeping rank-and-file members in Washington was unnecessary to get another deal done. \u201cObviously we\u2019re not going to negotiate this on the floor. Members don\u2019t have to be on the floor to do this,\u201d he said. Instead, any bargain would be hashed out by party leaders, including Pelosi, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Hoyer said. Odds for another major stimulus package to be passed before the Nov. 3 presidential election dimmed considerably earlier, after Pelosi, McConnell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin all said the focus should be on passing a temporary spending bill to keep the government operating after Sept. 30. A stimulus package had been expected to hitch a ride with the yet-to-be negotiated continuing resolution, but once the decision was made to keep the issues separate, prospects for a standalone stimulus plan faded. Senate Republicans united behind a narrow bill last week in their first week back in session since August, but it was blocked by Senate Democrats. Republicans have said Democrats refuse to negotiate and that much less stimulus is needed than Democrats desire. Pelosi has said Democrats have lowered the amount they are seeking but Republicans and the White House have not proposed packages big enough to deal with the coronoavirus pandemic and its economic impact. The House is currently scheduled to recess to allow lawmakers to hit the election campaign trail on Oct. 2, two days after the Sept. 30 fiscal year-end deadline. Pelosi made similar comments about canceling the traditional August break if no deal was reached, but ultimately sent lawmakers home except for one weekend to vote on postal legislation. Pelosi\u2019s hardline stance has rankled some in her caucus, who would rather have a small deal than go into the last weeks of the fall campaign season empty-handed. Some 25 House Democrats are part of a bipartisan group that calls itself the Problem Solvers Caucus, which proposed a $1.5 trillion plan as a compromise. \u201cWhat brings us together \u2014 25 Democrats and 25 Republicans \u2014 is our shared goal of finding a pragmatic solution \u2014 a bipartisan path forward \u2014 to help get negotiators to return to the table,\u201d said group co-chair Rep. Josh Gottheimer, a Democrat from New Jersey. Pelosi on Tuesday continued to downplay the benefits of a narrow deal, in part because she said it was unlikely other issues would be taken up later. \u201cThere is no later with this administration. This is the opportunity,\u201d she said. \u201cA skinny deal is a Republican bill. That is not a deal, at all.\u201d In a show of support for Pelosi\u2019s stance, eight House committee chairmen and chairwomen late in the day publicly rejected the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus\u2019 plan. \u201cWhen it comes to bolstering the public health system, supporting state and local governments, and assisting struggling families, the Problem Solvers\u2019 proposal leaves too many needs unmet,\u201d the group of committee leaders wrote in a joint statement."}]}
