President Donald Trump canceled the planned Republican National Convention events that were due to take place in hot spot Florida next month, after that state saw a record number of fatalities in a single day on Thursday at 173. The U.S. counted more than 1,000 deaths on Thursday, with more than 500 of them taking place in Florida, California and Texas. The U.S. death toll is now 144,780, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University, The U.S. added more than 69,900 cases on Thursday to push the total above 4 million, according to a New York Times tracker. The spread has accelerated through the summer, climbing to 4 million from 3 million in just 15 days, as the Washington Post reported. In the early days of the outbreak it took 45 days to increase from 1 million to 2 million cases, and then took 27 days to rise to 3 million. Forty states have seen rising cases in the last 14 days, according to the Times tracker, led by Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi. Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards told reporters at a briefing that his state is nearing breaking point after its case tally rose above 100,000. Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House Task Force created to manage the pandemic, took a more somber tone than usual on Friday on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday Show.\u201d \u201cI just want to make it clear to the American public: What we have now are essentially three New Yorks, with these three major states,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so we\u2019re really having to respond as an American people, and that\u2019s why you hear us calling for masks and increased social distancing to really stop the spread of this epidemic.\u201d The face mask issue continued to be a thorny issue with the American public with legal challenges against mandates extending to Oregon on Thursday, when conservative group Freedom Foundation filed a suit against Gov. Kate Brown. \u201cGovernors in left-leaning states all over the country are making up the rules as they go \u2013 and ignoring the procedural rules their own state laws set up,\u201d Jason Dudash, the Freedom Foundation\u2019s Oregon director, said in a statement on the group\u2019s website. Last week, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp sued Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms over her face mask mandate. Several Georgia cities have also filed suits, while counties and districts in other states, including California, have also launched suits. Public health experts have stressed that wearing face masks is key to containing the virus, along with frequent hand washing and social distancing. Robert Redfield, head of the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control, said at a recent news conference that if every American agreed to wear a mask, \u201cover the next six weeks we could drive (the virus) into the ground.\u201d Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel of the University of Pennsylvania, an oncologist, bioethicist and senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, reiterated his concern that the U.S. has squandered the last four months, \u201cand it really is very, very depressing,\u201d he said in an interview on MSNBC. \u201cWe\u2019re really right back in March,\u201d he said.Latest tallies The global death tally from COVID-19 stands at 634,954, the Johns Hopkins data shows, and at least 8.9 million people have recovered. Brazil is second to the U.S. with 2.3 million cases and 84,082 deaths. India is third measured by cases at 1.3 million, followed by Russia with 799,499 and South Africa with 408,052. The U.K. has 299,500 cases and 45,762 fatalities, the highest in Europe and third highest in the world. China, where the illness was first reported late last year, has 86,177 cases and 4,650 fatalities.What\u2019s the economy saying? There was good news on the housing front Friday, when data showed sales of new single-family homes rose sharply in June for the second straight month, pushing the sales rate to its highest level in 13 years, as MarketWatch\u2019s Greg Robb reported. The annual sales pace for U.S. new-home sales rose 13.8% last month to 776,000, the Commerce Department said Friday. That\u2019s above the prior cycle high of 774,000 hit in January and is the strongest since July 2007, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Economists polled by MarketWatch had expected a June sales rate of 710,000, compared with an original May estimate of 676,000. On Friday, the government revised May\u2019s rate to 682,000. That pushed the May rise in new home sales to 19.4% \u201cThe impact of falling mortgage rates \u2014 down 80 basis points this year \u2014 is more than offsetting the wave of Covid-induced job losses, which seem to be hitting younger renters rather than would-be homebuyers; the median buyer is 47 years of age, while the median restaurant employee is 29,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. See: America is facing an eviction crisis as moratoriums expire: \u2018This is a potential catastrophe\u2019 A separate report found the service sector lagging behind manufacturing, as some areas of the country have reimposed lockdown measures. IHS Markit said its U.S. flash manufacturing purchasing managers index rose to 51.3 in July from 49.8 in the previous month. The flash services purchasing managers index rose only to 49.6 from 47.9 in June. Any reading above 50.0 indicates improving conditions, while readings below that measure indicate contraction. The flash estimate is typically based on approximately 85%\u201390% of total survey responses each month. See:Baseball is back \u2014 here\u2019s how U.S. sports leagues are returning during the pandemic The U.S. economy is experiencing the first-ever recession driven by the services sector. And economists are concerned because some key service sectors like travel, restaurants, and entertainment are not expected to recover soon given the pandemic. Manufacturing is slowly getting on its feet but is still experiencing headwinds. \u201cThe lack of growth is a disappointment,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.What are companies saying? Three Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% components reported earnings, starting late Thursday with chip giant Intel Corp., which disappointed with news of a delay in its next generation of semiconductor technology, MarketWatch\u2019s Jon Swartz reported. Intel said it may actually use a third party to manufacture it as a contingency plan. Intel INTC, -1.03% stock was slammed after it reported along with second-quarter earnings that the introduction of its 7-nanometer chips would be delayed by at least six months. AMD AMD, -3.94% is already selling 7-nm semiconductors for servers and PCs; in chip parlance, nanometers, or nm, is the size of the transistors that go on a computer chip, with the general rule being that smaller transistors are faster and more efficient in using power. \u201cWe have identified a defect mode in our 7-nanometer process that resulted in yield degradation,\u201d said Bob Swan, Intel\u2019s chief executive, on a conference call late Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019ve root-caused the issue and believe there are no fundamental roadblocks, but we have also invested in contingency plans to hedge against further schedule uncertainty.\u201d See now: Intel admits another defeat with unprecedented manufacturing issues There was better news from American Express Co. AXP, +0.26%, which posted a surprise profit for the second quarter, but revenue that lagged estimates amid a fall in card member spending during the pandemic. Verizon Communications VZ, +0.23% beat on profit and revenue but its report showed negative impacts from the pandemic. The wireless operator estimates that both GAAP and adjusted EPS saw negative impacts of about 14 cents stemming from impacts to wireless service revenue and lower advertising and search revenue for Verizon\u2019s media unit. Elsewhere, there was a setback for Moderna Inc. MRNA, +0.09%, one of the many companies working on a COVID-19 vaccine candidate. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ruled in favor of Arbutus Biopharma Corp. ABUS, +1.91% in a patent dispute between the companies, MarketWatch\u2019s Jaimy Lee reported. The decision may mean that Arbutus will attempt to make a royalty claim to products developed by Moderna\u2019s lipid nanoparticle delivery technology, which is currently being used to develop a COVID-19 vaccine. SVB Leerink\u2019s Mani Foroohar said the ruling is a \u201cdisappointing turn\u201d for Moderna, and \u201cany meaningful royalty burden could hamper MRNA\u2019s pricing flexibility and margin profile vs. other players in the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine market.\u201d What It Would Take to Reach Herd Immunity for the Coronavirus Here\u2019s the latest news on companies and COVID-19: \u2022 Fans of the iPhone will probably have to wait at least another month before shiny new models are unveiled. Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.74% is delaying its annual fall event until the latter half of October instead of early September, according to a tech blog.

The company also declared a quarterly cash dividend of 14 cents a share. \u2022 Honeywell International Inc. HON, +0.34% reported second-quarter profit and sales that fell, but beat expectations.

SLB, -1.21% swung to a multibillion-dollar loss in the second quarter and revenue fell short of estimates, as the twin effects of the pandemic and falling oil price weighed. \u201cThis has probably been the most challenging quarter in past decades,\u201d Chief Executive Olivier Le Peuch said, as he announced 21,000 job cuts. Revenue fell 28% from the first quarter, \u201ccaused by the unprecedented fall in North America activity, and international activity drop due to downward revisions to customer budgets accentuated by COVID-19 disruptions. This speaks volumes about an industry confronted with historic oil demand and supply imbalances caused by demand destruction from the global COVID-19 containment effort.\u201d The company is reorganizing and combining its 17 product lines into four divisions, restructuring geographically around five key basins of activity and streamlining management, he said. Schlumberger expects to remove $1.5 billion of costs permanently. \u201cLooking at the macro view in the near-term, oil demand is slowly starting to normalize and is expected to improve as government measures support consumption,\u201d said the CEO. \u201cHowever, subsequent waves of potential COVID-19 resurgence pose a negative risk to this outlook.\u201d \u2022 Skechers USA Inc. SKX, -1.75% reported a narrower-than-expected adjusted second-quarter loss and sales that were above expectations. \u201cSkechers, like most businesses around the world, has never faced a more challenging time than during the pandemic, which caused the closing of nearly every market worldwide,\u201d Chief Executive Robert Greenberg said.

The company did not provide an outlook. \u2022 Office supply equipment retailer Staples became the latest to require face coverings in all its stores starting Monday.

Additionally, Disney delayed releases of Star Wars and Avatar movies by a year. \u201cOver the last few months, it\u2019s become clear that nothing can be set in stone when it comes to how we release films during this global health crisis, and today that means pausing our release plans for \u2018Mulan\u2019 as we assess how we can most effectively bring this film to audiences around the world,\u201d a Walt Disney Studios spokesperson said in a statement."}]}
