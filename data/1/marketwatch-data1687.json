Arkansas\u2019s daily growth rate remains above 5%, while six states \u2014 Arizona, South Carolina, Alabama, Arkansas, North Carolina and Tennessee \u2014 have daily growth rates of more than 3%, according to J.P. Morgan analysts. \u201c \u2018The administration\u2019s argument that less testing means fewer COVID-19 cases exist is absurd.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Kyle Herrig, Accountable.US \u201cEight states ... have a five-day moving average case growth [of] 50 basis points above their 14-day [moving average],\u201d analysts led by Gary Taylor wrote in a Tuesday note to clients, noting that those states make up about 14% of the U.S. population. Ten states had record levels of hospitalizations on Sunday, according to data obtained by the Washington Post, namely Alabama, Arkansas, California, Florida, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. Yet states are still moving fast to reopen shops and other businesses, and in some areas the wearing of face masks has become part of a culture war. See: Why do so many Americans refuse to wear face masks? California is reopening malls, cinemas and museums, raising concerns among health-care experts as its numbers start to tick higher again. Vice President Mike Pence on a call with state governors on Monday actively encouraged them to echo the administration\u2019s stance that the increase in cases is due to an increase in testing and only reflect what he called \u201cintermittent spikes,\u201d the New York Times reported. Pence \u2014 who also had an op-ed published Tuesday in the Wall Street Journal, wherein he credited President Donald Trump with having \u201crallied the American people to embrace social-distancing guidelines\u201d \u2014 was offering a variation on the message voiced by Trump earlier Monday. \u201cIf you don\u2019t test, you don\u2019t have any cases,\u201d Trump had said. \u201cIf we stop testing right now, we\u2019d have very few cases, if any.\u201d Critics were unimpressed by the White House\u2019s emerging argument. \u201cThe administration\u2019s argument that less testing means fewer COVID-19 cases exist is absurd,\u201d said Kyle Herrig, president of the nonpartisan advocacy group Accountable.US. \u201cThe president and his allies pushed states to reopen before they had the testing resources to do so safely. Now that coronavirus infections are spiking in states across the country, Trump and Pence again want to shift the blame for their own administration\u2019s failures.\u201d Don\u2019t miss:Is America\u2019s most masked city losing its grip on safety? Michael Osterholm, head of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, reiterated his position on MSNBC on Tuesday that the virus \u201cwon\u2019t rest\u201d till 60% to 70% of the population has been infected. \u201cWe have 21 states where cases are going up and quite dramatically, and it\u2019s not just testing, but more people are testing positive and in some places hospitals are overflowing,\u201d he said. One city was taking notice of the renewed public-safety concerns. Miami, one of Florida\u2019s most populous cities, is putting its reopening on pause, according to Mayor Francis Suarez, as ABC News reported. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Trump-aligned Republican, ended his stay-at-home order on May 4, against the advice of health experts. At the time, the Sunshine State was counting about 680 cases a day. As of June 14, the state\u2019s seven-day rolling average had climbed to 1,661 a day. Daily confirmed new cases \u2014 three-day moving average shown \u2014 in Florida.

The Philippines has 26,781 confirmed cases of the virus and 1,103 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins data.What\u2019s the latest medical news? A commonly used steroid reduced deaths in hospitalized COVID-19 patients who were on ventilators or receiving oxygen support, according to a snapshot of data from a clinical trial in the United Kingdom, as MarketWatch\u2019s Jaimy Lee reported. The randomized study, which is being conducted by the University of Oxford, is testing dexamethasone as part of a larger trial evaluating multiple potential treatments for COVID-19. About 2,100 patients received a low dose of dexamethasone for 10 days; another 4,300 patients received the standard of care. Though the steroid reduced death in ventilated and oxygen-receiving patients, it did not benefit patients with COVID-19 who did not require respiratory support. The trial\u2019s steering committee had halted enrollment in the dexamethasone arm on March 8. Oxford researchers said in a news release that they plan to publish the full clinical details \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d \u201cDexamethasone is the first drug to be shown to improve survival in COVID-19,\u201d Dr. Peter Horby, a chief investigator for the study, said in the news release. \u201cThe survival benefit is clear and large in those patients who are sick enough to require oxygen treatment.\u201d In the U.S., Gilead Sciences Inc.\u2019s GILD, +0.82% remdesivir is one of the few treatments to have an emergency-use authorization as a COVID-19 therapy. The Food and Drug Administration on Monday revoked the emergency authorizations granted in March to hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, two decades-old malaria drugs that were touted by Trump and allies as a potential treatment despite a lack of supporting evidence. On Monday, the FDA warned that the two drugs could adversely affect remdesivir if used in combination and would reduce its efficacy. What\u2019s the economy saying? Sales at U.S. retailers roared back in May as the economy started to reopen and claw its way out of the recession created by the pandemic. Retail sales jumped a record 17.7% last month, the government said Tuesday. Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast an 8.5% increase. Sales had tumbled by a record 14.7% in April and 8.2% in March, revised statistics show. The rebound in sales largely reflects the loosening of restrictions on business activity after two months of stay-at-home orders. Along with pent-up consumer demand, federal tax payments to families and more generous unemployment benefits also helped stoke higher sales. Still, sales remain 6% lower compared to the same month in 2019, showing the lingering damage caused by the lockdown of the economy. Read:Clothing stores, not bars and restaurants, took the biggest sales hit from the coronavirus \u201cThe strength of retail sales is testimony to the power of reopening the economy, even partially. It is also a testimony to how big the decline in activity was in the three months through April,\u201d said chief economist Chris Low of FHN Financial. See now: The coronavirus recession may already be over, but it\u2019s a long uphill climb to \u2018normal\u2019 A separate report showed business inventories declined 1.3% in April.What are companies saying? The IPO market continued to recover from a pandemic-induced lull in March, April and May, with the pricing of the biggest deal so far this year. Royalty Pharma RPRX, -0.04%, a buyer of biopharmaceutical royalties, priced its IPO late Monday at the high end of its range and upsized the deal, pointing to strong demand from investors, which was later borne out in open trading. The company sold 77 million shares priced at $28 each to raise $2.2 billion. It originally planned to offer 70 million shares. That puts it ahead of the previous biggest 2020 deal, the IPO of Warner Music Group Corp. WMG, +0.54%, which raised $1.925 billion for the parent of Atlantic Records, Warner Records and Elektra Records. \u201cRoyalty Pharma is highly profitable and generates strong cash flow, and it intends to pay a dividend with 2.3% yield at the midpoint,\u201d said Renaissance Capital, a provider of institutional research and IPO ETFs, in commentary.

There were 13 banks underwriting the deal, led by J.P. Morgan. The deal is the first of five expected to price this week, all of them in the health-care and biotech sectors. Elsewhere, Citigroup assigned Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.74% its highest stock-price target among Wall Street analysts listed on FactSet. Analyst Jim Suva raised his target for the iPhone maker to $400, up from $310, while sticking with a buy rating. Suva is expecting Apple to benefit from the upcoming 5G upgrade cycle, and, while it may start selling its new 5G phones a month or so later than usual in the fall, the company \u201cwill likely have a strong 5G product offering in time for Christmas 2020.\u201d Suva said he sees room for the company to gain share from Huawei, which he estimates could drive about $8 billion in incremental sales. Suva predicted that the services business could get a boost from growing adoption of Apple Pay due to the pandemic and a rebound for the Apple Care business once the new iPhone comes out later this year. Apple may also debut a bundled offering for some of its services, including music, video, news and gaming, he wrote. Other companies continued to announce bond and equity offerings to bolster liquidity hurt by the crisis, and to offer updates on sales and earnings.

The device only needs an electrical outlet to be deployed. Amazon has installed Distance Assistance in \u201ca handful\u201d of its own buildings, and will be adding hundreds over the coming weeks. \u201cWe are also beginning the process to open source the software and AI behind this innovation so that anyone can create their own Distance Assistant,\u201d wrote Brad Porter, a vice president and Amazon engineer, in a blog post on the company website. \u2022 Big Lots Inc.
