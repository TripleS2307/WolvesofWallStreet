Unlike the federal moratorium included in the CARES Act that expired in late July, the CDC's moratorium will apply to all rental units nationwide, senior administration officials said. Renters will be eligible for the moratorium's protection if they received a stimulus check, and they must be able to prove that they made an effort to receive government assistance and that they could not afford rent."}]}
