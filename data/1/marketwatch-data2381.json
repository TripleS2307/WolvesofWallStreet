Gavin Newsom said Monday in issuing a sweeping set of closures to head off surging coronavirus cases and hospitalizations. The order is part of the state\u2019s new strategy to control the spread of the virus by focusing on limiting indoor activities to reflect public health officials\u2019 evolving understanding of how the virus spreads. Earlier in the pandemic California closed beaches, campgrounds and state parks as it sought to limit interactions of people from different households. But as data showed the virus was most likely to be transmitted indoors, the Newsom administration began modifying public health orders, including ordering people to wear face coverings and leaving outdoor activities alone. Newsom has repeatedly implored people to refrain from social gatherings and he expressed frustration that many aren\u2019t following the guidance. \u201cCOVID-19 is not going away anytime soon, until there is a vaccine and or an effective therapy,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cLimit your mixing with people outside of your household. It\u2019s just common sense, but the data suggests not everyone is practicing common sense.\u201d The city of Los Angeles immediately implemented the mandated shutdowns and Mayor Eric Garcetti said he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to go further. Earlier this month the city created a color-coded system to designate the threat level from the virus and corresponding shutdowns. Rising numbers of cases and hospitalizations now have it at orange \u2014 the second-highest designation, when people are to minimize all contact with anyone outside their household. \u201cRed is when everything shuts down again \u2014 everything, to our strictest level. And I do want to warn people that we\u2019re close to that,\u201d Garcetti said. Newsom\u2019s move faced immediate resistance from religious groups and business organizations. Fred Jones, attorney for the Professional Beauty Federation of California, suggested many hair salons may not comply with the order. He said there is \u201cno evidence that a single contagion has been spread in a salon since we\u2019ve been allowed to reopen.\u201d \u201cHe should be partnering with his state licensed-professionals, not shutting us down,\u201d Jones said. Robbert Tyler, the attorney for California-based Advocates for Faith and Freedom, said he believes Newsom\u2019s order on religious services is unconstitutional. While Newsom says churches can meet outdoors, Tyler said many don\u2019t have the facilities for that. \u201cWe have not only an economic crisis but we have a spiritual and mental health crisis that requires as much attention as COVID-19,\u201d said Tyler, whose nonprofit organization represents churches on religious liberty issues. \u201cTo tell churches they can no longer meet indoors is just a further restriction upon the incredible services provided by churches across the state that are desperately needed.\u201d California was the first state in the country to issue a mandatory, statewide stay-at-home order aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus. Most businesses and churches voluntarily complied, scrambling to let employees work from home and moving worship services online. Public health officials praised Newsom, crediting the March 19 order with limiting the virus\u2019 impact in the nation\u2019s most populous state, which has about 40 million residents. But the order devastated the economy, causing more than 7.5 million people to file for unemployment benefits. Newsom moved quickly to reopen the economy in May but by mid-June there were signs that the virus was resurgent and when July arrived Newsom took action. For counties on the state\u2019s watch for rising virus cases, he ordered bars to close and indoor operations halted at restaurants, wineries, tasting rooms, zoos, museums and family entertainment centers like bowling alleys and miniature golf courses. On Monday, Newsom extended that order statewide. In the last two weeks, the number of counties on the watch list has swelled from 19 to 30, covering roughly 80% of the state\u2019s population. During that period coronavirus-related hospitalizations have risen 28%, including a 20% increase in patients requiring intensive care. The state\u2019s death toll now is above 7,000. Also Monday, Newsom imposed new restrictions for counties on the state\u2019s watch list, ordering them to halt indoor operations for gyms, nail salons, tattoo parlors, hair salons and barbershops, shopping malls and offices for nonessential sectors. The affected counties include Los Angeles and virtually all of Southern California. Francesca Schuler, advisory board member for the California Fitness Alliance, said her group appreciates the challenge Newsom is facing but is disappointed by the closures. She said fitness centers worked with the state to develop high standards and strict guidelines, including having people wear masks when they work out. \u201cWe\u2019re all in on supporting doing the right thing to flatten the curve, but we do believe physical and mental health is the second crisis that\u2019s emerging right now,\u201d she said. \u201cFitness is key to that, particularly to mental health.\u201d In Los Angeles County, where 10 million people live, Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said she would update the county\u2019s public health order to reflect Newsom\u2019s new directives. She said data shows \u201ceverything is pointing toward an alarming trend,\u201d noting that \u201cevery day thousands of people in our community are being infected.\u201d \u201cI know this step back in our recovery journey is disheartening but we must do everything in our power to stop the virus from spreading, from making the people we love sick and from causing untimely deaths,\u201d Ferrer said. Other county leaders were frustrated. Butte County Supervisor Bill Connelly said he has not changed his behavior during the pandemic, except when he was forced to wear a mask while attending church on Sunday. He blamed Newsom for making the \u201ccure worse than the disease.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s putting these small businesses under extreme strain, they are going to go under,\u201d said Connelly, whose county is not on the state\u2019s watch list. \u201cWe should have more discretion as to what to do in our communities.\u201d For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death."}]}
