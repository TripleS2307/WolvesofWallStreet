The electric vehicle and battery maker\u2019s stock TSLA, +1.89% plunged 21.1% to close at $331.21 Tuesday. The previous record selloff was the 19.3% drop on Jan. 13, 2012, while the biggest post-COVID-19 crisis decline was 18.6% on March 16. Tesla went public on June 29, 2010, at a pre-split adjusted initial public offering price of $17 ($3.40 split adjusted). Tesla\u2019s stock has now plummeted has lost 33.7% since closing at a record $498.32 about a week ago, which is the day a 5-for-1 stock split took effect. The stock\u2019s selloff kicked off last Tuesday after the electric vehicle maker disclosed a $5 billion stock offering and a large shareholder reduced its stake. On Friday, the stock had plunged as much as 8.6% intraday, before pulling a sharp U-turn to close up 2.8%, to snap a 3-day losing streak, after the company disclosed stock trades by a number of insiders.

Then after the close Friday, the stock took a beating after S&P Dow Jones Indices stunned investors by not adding Tesla\u2019s stock to its benchmark S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87%, as many on Wall Street believed was a foregone conclusion. \u201cTesla not getting into the S&P 500 club is a head scratcher and the stock will likely be down for the indexing implications,\u201d Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in an email to MarketWatch, as reported by MarketWatch\u2019s Jeremy Owens. Don\u2019t miss: S&P 500 adds three companies not named Tesla \u2014 \u2018a bit of a shocker,\u2019 analyst says. \u201cWith an estimated ~$4.5 [trillion] of assets indexed to the S&P 500, we think shares were reflecting expectations for substantial passive inflows,\u201d Baird analyst Ben Kallo wrote in a research note. \u201cUnclear why [Tesla] was not included in the recent rebalancing cycle, though we do think the stock will eventually be added to the S&P 500, having fulfilled all inclusion criteria.\u201d The shock snubbing pushed the stock over the widely-watched 20%-decline threshold. Many on Wall Street label a decline on a closing basis of at least 10% to up to 20% from a record as a correction, and define bear market as a drop of at least 20%. Although those definitions are arbitrary and not necessarily considered a trading trigger, they are still often noted in trading lore, as they can be useful in recognizing volatility amid longer-term trends. Despite this week\u2019s tumble, the stock was still up nearly fourfold (up 294.7%) year to date, while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.39% , of which Tesla is a member, has rallied 20.9% and the S&P 500 has gained 3.1%. Tesla\u2019s market cap is $307.7 billion, compared with the market caps for S&P 500 components General Motors Co. GM, -0.15% of $46.3 billion and Ford Motor Co. F, -1.36% of $28.0 billion. It took just two days for the stock to enter correction territory, as on Sept. 2 it closed 10.2% below its Aug. 31 record. Many would view a close on Tuesday at or below $398.65 as marking the beginning of a bear market.
