PFE, -0.27% both jumped in premarket trading on Monday after the companies said their experimental COVID-19 vaccine produced a T-cell response in people participating in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in Germany. The vaccine candidate also again demonstrated that it can trigger an antibody response. BioNTech's stock rallied 10.4% and shares of Pfizer gained 4.1% before the market opened. Analysts and medical experts are paying close attention to two metrics in clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccine candidates: neutralizing antibody titers, and T-cell responses, both of which may indicate an antiviral response. The companies have previously released promising data from a ]placebo-controlled, randomized Phase 1 study being conducted in the U.S. that reported higher neutralizing antibodies than seen in people recovering from a coronavirus infection. This trial is an ongoing, open-label, non-randomized, non-placebo-controlled study, which is considered less rigorous, that enrolled 60 healthy adult participants. \"The preliminary data indicate that our mRNA-based vaccine was able to stimulate antibody as well as T-cell responses at remarkably low dose levels,\" Dr. \u00d6zlem T\u00fcreci, BioNTech's chief medical officer, said in a news release. A Phase 2/3 trial with 30,000 participants is expected to start this month if the companies receive regulatory approval to move forward. Since the start of the year, shares of BioNTech have soared 151.6% and Pfizer's stock is down 7.5%. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% has declined 0.2% year-to-date."}]}
