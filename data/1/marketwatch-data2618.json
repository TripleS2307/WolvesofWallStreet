The current-account deficit widened to $170 billion from a revised $111.5 billion in the first quarter. This is a 52.9% increase. The large widening reflected an expanded deficit of goods and reduced surpluses on primary income and on services, the government said. The current account reveals if a country is a net lender or debtor. The current account deficit was equal to 3.5% of GDP in the second quarter, up from 2.1% in the prior quarter. The current-account deficit peaked in 2005 at 6.3%."}]}
