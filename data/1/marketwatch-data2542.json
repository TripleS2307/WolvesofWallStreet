Rent was already a struggle.\u201d But the coronavirus has exacerbated the situation. An estimated 735,000 households in New York City have lost employment income as a result of COVID-19, according to the NYU Furman Center, a group that advances research and debate on housing and urban policy. Black and Hispanic households in the city have been particularly hard hit. Approximately 58% of Hispanic wage-earning households and 38% of Black wage-earning households worked in industries that were vulnerable to disruption from coronavirus, like hospitality, according to an analysis from the group. Community organizations say that as a result, an estimated 50,000 renters could face eviction proceedings when the housing courts fully reopen. Samuel Himmelstein, a partner at the law firm Himmelstein, McConnell, Gribben, Donoghue & Joseph, who focuses on tenants\u2019 rights litigation, said that since March, his office has been inundated by New Yorkers who lost their jobs. \u201cI and the firm have been overwhelmed with inquiries from people who are basically saying, \u2018I can\u2019t afford my rent, I\u2019m running out of money. What are my options?\u2019\u201d Himmelstein said. \u201cI\u2019ve been practicing for 40 years and I\u2019ve never seen anything like this.\u201d Meanwhile, housing courts in New York City have reopened their brick-and-mortar locations for current litigants to drop off filings. They are also hearing cases virtually in which both the plaintiff and defendant have an attorney, and setting up remote conferences to move them forward or settle. Also read: New York culture creaks back to life, COVID-style Landlords can also begin new cases by mail, and some tenants have started getting served with those cases. How post-pandemic cases are going to be processed after they are initiated through mail, however, is unclear. There are still no required in-person appearances for those cases, and no trials taking place. \u201cI personally can\u2019t imagine the courts reopening physically until there\u2019s either a cure or a vaccine,\u201d Himmelstein said. \u201cThat court is a disease cesspool when it\u2019s functioning normally...and I\u2019m not saying that because of the people that are there, I\u2019m saying that because of the facility,\u201d he added, referring to the cramped quarters of Brooklyn Housing Court, originally a commercial building. All the while, Judith Goldiner, who runs the civil law reform unit for The Legal Aid Society, a social justice law firm, has taken part in around 10 virtual town halls to let people know their rights and what\u2019s going on with housing. \u201cPeople are pretty scared, pretty desperate,\u201d Goldiner said. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to be trying to hold the line until we can get some money from Congress.\u201d Many are hoping that the proposed $3 trillion Heroes Act coronavirus relief bill, currently stalled in Congress, or some other aid will provide rent relief on a scale of magnitude that only the federal government can provide. See: Renters face financial cliff ahead as eviction moratorium ends July 25 \u201cIt\u2019s almost unthinkable that there wouldn\u2019t be some sort of intervention given where we are,\u201d said Matthew Murphy, the executive director of the NYU Furman Center. \u201cOtherwise, you\u2019ll see consequences across the entire industry, both on the tenant side, additional eviction filings and nonpayment cases; and then on the landlord side, mortgage foreclosures, defaulting on loans, not paying property taxes.\u201d On the local level, the state\u2019s Tenant Safe Harbor Act, passed on June 30, extended certain protections, prohibiting courts from evicting residential tenants for nonpayment due to coronavirus, though a landlord can still try to get a money judgment against a tenant.. Also, Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday announced a new coronavirus rental assistance program. Successful applicants will receive a one-time subsidy, paid directly to their landlord that would cover the difference between the percentage of their gross income spent on rent on March 1, and whatever that percentage became during the following months. For example, if a household spent 35% of their gross income on rent on March 1, and are now spending 50% on rent, this program would cover the 15% difference. Applicants must be under a certain income threshold, pay more than 30% of their gross monthly income in rent, and must have lost income between April 1 and July 31. Renters can apply for assistance within a two-week period beginning Thursday, July 16. Related: More than 20 million Americans may be evicted by September There is a state executive order for 60 days starting June 20 that halts the enforcement of a foreclosure against owners of a commercial or residential property who are facing financial hardship as a result of the coronavirus. \u201cWhen that moratorium is lifted, the moratorium on mortgage payments, that is when we\u2019re going to see the real impact of this Covid situation, when the banks start becoming aggressive and trying to collect the mortgage payment,\u201d said Richard St. Paul, the executive director of the New York Small Housing Association, a group for landlords who own between one and five rental units in a home. On a grassroots level, rent strikes and housing protests have sprung up around the city this summer to raise political awareness and keep people in their homes. Holden Taylor is on the organizing committee of the Crown Heights Tenant Union, a group made up of different tenant associations in the neighborhood. \u201cWe\u2019re on the precipice of absolute crisis,\u201d Taylor said. The organization is involved in rent strikes in 35 buildings, according to Taylor. They are reaching out to people who don\u2019t have the money to pay their rent, and those who do but want to join the rent strike in solidarity. Taylor, along with about a quarter of tenants in his own building and the building next door, owned by the same landlord, are on a rent strike. Tenants have had a years-long troubled history with the landlord, and Taylor said that the courtyard of his building is currently filled with sewage. Even with the eviction moratorium for some tenants, renters will still be financially responsible for back rent when it comes due. \u201cI do see a crisis coming, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen overnight,\u201d Himmelstein said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to happen when the courts really start functioning normally again. At that point, I think there\u2019s going to be a flood of new cases.\u201d"}]}
