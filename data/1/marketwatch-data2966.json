The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% added about 107 points, 0.4%, to open near 27,540, the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% rose 7 points or 0.2% to open near 3,358, and the Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39% touched 11,034 at the start of trading, adding about 23 points or 0.2%. Stocks closed mostly higher Friday even though congressional talks on extending virus aid broke down. Investors must now consider the unilateral actions taken by President Donald Trump over the weekend, which some analysts say are likely to be both illegal and ineffective but could prompt a fresh round of congressional negotiations. Travel companies like Marriott International Inc. MAR, -0.96% and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL, +2.59% were mixed in early morning trade after reporting wider-than-expected losses Monday."}]}
