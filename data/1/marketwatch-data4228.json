URBN, +0.53% shares soared more than 12% in the extended session Tuesday after the retailer swung to a surprise second-quarter profit and sales were above Wall Street expectations thanks to online sales. Urban Outfitters said it earned $34 million, or 35 cents a share, in the quarter, compared with earnings of $60 million, or 61 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Sales fell 16.5% to $803 million. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected a loss of 40 cents a share on sales of $672 million in the quarter. Same-store sales decreased 13%, with the drop for brick-and-mortar stores, closed for part of the quarter due to the pandemic, offset by online sales. \"I'm pleased to announce (Urban) produced solid revenues and profits for the second quarter driven by strength in the digital channel,\" Chief Executive Richard A. Hayne said in a statement. \"Notably, all brands were profitable and enter the fall selling season with lean inventories and positive momentum.\""}]}
