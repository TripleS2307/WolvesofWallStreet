It is part of the America\u2019s Entrepreneurs report. Running a small business can be daunting in the best of times. Throw in a pandemic and it can be devastating. But some older entrepreneurs are thriving during COVID-19 because of growing demand for their particular products and services. Here are three of their stories:Joe Sandschulte: Mobile bike repairman Joe Sandschulte, 66, spends his days driving his Bicycle Fixer van through the streets of suburban Seattle. He can\u2019t keep up with the demand for his mobile bike repair service. Sales this spring were up about 50% over last year because the COVID-19 stay-at-home orders have led more people to bike rather than drive. Bike shops have seen an uptick in sales nationwide with the boom in socially distanced recreation and transportation. But mobile bike repair services like Sandschulte\u2019s are especially hot, given continuing fears about going back into brick-and-mortar stores. \u201cI still see three or four clients a day. But instead of repairing one bike, I will repair a whole family\u2019s worth of bikes \u2014 three or four. People love the convenience,\u201d Sandschulte says. He left his position as a bike shop service manager seven years ago to open the mobile business. At the time, his wife worried about her husband giving up benefits and a steady paycheck. Things were tough at first. \u201cThe first year, it wasn\u2019t exactly raining money,\u201d Sandschulte recalls. But he built up his business with a steady clientele of home and corporate clients who don\u2019t miss lugging their bikes to the repair shop.

He plans to ride the business into his 70s. \u201cI\u2019m doing my own thing. I just love the freedom,\u201d Sandschulte says. 80% of older Americans can't afford to retire - COVID-19 isn't helping Rebecca Myers: Medical marijuana grower and processor In September 2019, Rebecca Myers \u2014 who describes herself as over 50 \u2014 opened FarmaceuticalRX, a medical marijuana grower and processing facility, inside a former steel mill in western Pennsylvania. Six months later, the pandemic hit, and Myers worried she\u2019d have to shut it down. But that didn\u2019t happen. The reason: Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf deemed medical marijuana an essential business. \u201cWho would have thought the day would come that the government deemed a medical marijuana business essential?\u201d says Myers. \u201cBut we all know it\u2019s true. Patients need us more than ever during this incredibly anxious and emotional time.\u201d Myers has also weathered the pandemic storm by being proactive. After reading early reports of the devastation of COVID-19 in China, she implemented social distancing, masks and gloves inside the plant. If employees have COVID-related symptoms and exposure, they get paid sick leave.

Myers plans to start cultivating and processing in Ohio, too. This career path was never one she envisioned. \u201cIf you had told me 20 years ago that I would be running a business that grew marijuana, I would have laughed,\u201d says Myers. Previously, as a former district attorney in the Bronx, she prosecuted drug and other crimes. She has also worked in the opiate treatment industry. And the former Division 1 basketball player \u2014 Myers was starting point guard at Fordham University \u2014 had never partied like other college students. But then a family medical crisis made her realize the urgent need for medical marijuana. A cousin was diagnosed with osteosarcoma (a type of bone cancer) and had his leg amputated; medical marijuana was the only thing getting him through the punishing chemotherapy treatments. But it was still illegal in Ohio. Myers ran into many people with similar stories about sick loved ones who couldn\u2019t get medical marijuana. So she spent $14 million to renovate two buildings from the former Sharon Steel Corp. in Farrell, Pa. But since \u201cI don\u2019t have a green thumb,\u201d she says, Myers traveled around the country to interview the best organic growers. She also began partnering with Penn State University, Case Western Reserve University and Harvard Medical School\u2019s Dana\u2013Farber Cancer Institute on medical research. Aside from wanting to get medical marijuana to people who needed it, Myers also yearned to bring jobs back to a region that struggled for decades following the collapse of the steel industry.

Currently, her company has 77 employees at its two locations. \u201cThere are a lot of wonderful people with a great work ethic,\u201d Myers says.Mark Meyer: Microdistiller Mark Meyer, now 69, was preparing to retire from being a lawyer when his adult children approached him with an idea: starting a family microdistillery. He and his wife, Mary Ellen, a retired occupational therapist, were shocked. \u201cWe weren\u2019t even whiskey drinkers. We drank a little wine,\u201d Mary Ellen says. But the idea grew on them, and Wigle Distillery, which makes craft whiskey and other spirits, was born in 2012. The first distillery to open In Pittsburgh since Prohibition, it was named after a founder of the Whiskey Rebellion. A Whiskey Rebellion of a different kind erupted in Pennsylvania in March 2020 when Pennsylvania liquor stores closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and customers howled in protest. To make things worse, the initial version of the state\u2019s online ordering system was a glitch-filled failure. Wigle Distillery\u2019s new mail-order service has helped the company survive after its six retail locations were ordered closed in March. WigleWhiskey.com Meyer was able to benefit from the Whiskey Rebellion because he had convinced the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board to allow the same mail-in service granted to state stores years ago. That part of his business had never gained traction until the pandemic hit. Wigle has also been offering curbside pickup services during COVID-19. In addition to helping his customers, Meyer says the changes in his business have been a \u201clifesaver\u201d for his award-winning craft brewery. The new mail-order service has helped Wigle Distillery survive after its six retail locations were ordered closed in March. The company reopened one retail location in June. For all the ups and downs, Meyer says he believes whiskey is as recession-proof as any business. \u201cIf spirits can survive Prohibition, it shows just how resilient it is,\u201d he says.
