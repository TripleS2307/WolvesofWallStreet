Two Russians who have held senior roles in Moscow\u2019s military intelligence service known as the GRU have been identified as responsible for a disinformation effort directed at American and Western audiences, U.S. government officials said. They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. The information had previously been classified, but officials said it had been downgraded so they could more freely discuss it. Officials said they were doing so now to sound the alarm about the particular websites and to expose a connection between the sites and Russian intelligence. Between late May and early July, one of the officials said, a trio of websites published about 150 articles about the pandemic response, including coverage aimed at propping up Russia and denigrating the U.S. Among the headlines that caught the attention of U.S. officials are \u201cRussia\u2019s Counter COVID-19 Aid to America Advances Case for D\u00e9tente,\u201d which suggested that Russia had given urgent and substantial aid to the U.S. to fight the pandemic, and \u201cBeijing Believes COVID-19 is a Biological Weapon.\u201d The disclosure comes as the spread of disinformation, including by Russia, is an urgent concern heading into November\u2019s presidential election as U.S. officials look to avoid a repeat of the 2016 contest, when Russia launched a covert social media campaign to divide American public opinion to favor then-candidate Donald Trump. The country\u2019s chief counterintelligence official warned in a public statement Friday about Russia\u2019s continued use of internet trolls to advance their goals. Even apart from politics, the twin crises buffeting the country and much of the world \u2014 the pandemic and race relations and protests \u2014 have offered fertile territory for misinformation or outright falsehoods. Officials described the disinformation as part of an ongoing and persistent Russian effort to cause confusion. They did not say whether the effort was directly related to the November election, though some of the coverage on the websites appeared to denigrate Trump\u2019s Democratic challenger, Joe Biden. The stories call to mind Russian efforts from 2016 to exacerbate race relations in America and drive corruption allegations against U.S. political figures. U.S. officials on Tuesday singled out a news agency, InfoRos.ru, that operates a trio of websites InfoRos.ru, Infobrics.org and OneWorld.press \u2014 that they say have leveraged the pandemic to promote anti-Western objectives and to spread disinformation. The sites promote their narratives in a sophisticated but insidious effort that officials liken to money laundering, where stories in well-written English \u2014 and often with pro-Russian sentiment and anti-U.S. sentiment \u2014 are cycled through other news sources to conceal their origin and enhance the legitimacy of the information. The sites also amplify stories that originate elsewhere, the government officials said. The sites focus on contemporary politics as well. A headline Tuesday on InfoRos.ru about the unrest roiling major American cities read \u201cChaos in the Blue Cities,\u201d accompanying a story that lamented how New Yorkers who grew up in the tough-on-crime approach of Mayors Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg \u201cmust adapt to life in high-crime urban areas.\u201d Another story carried the headline of \u201cUkrainian Trap for Biden,\u201d and claimed that \u201cUkrainegate\u201d \u2014 a reference to stories surrounding Biden\u2019s son Hunter\u2019s former ties to a Ukraine gas company \u2014 \u201ckeeps unfolding with renewed vigors.\u201d Two individuals who have also held leadership roles at InfoRos, identified Tuesday as Denis Valeryevich Tyurin and Aleksandr Gennadyevich Starunskiy, have previously served in a GRU unit specializing in military psychological intelligence and maintain deep contacts there, the officials said. InfoRos and One World\u2019s ties to the Russian state have attracted scrutiny in the past from European disinformation analysts. In 2019, a European Union task force that studies disinformation campaigns identified One World as \u201ca new addition to the pantheon of Moscow-based disinformation outlets.\u201d The task force noted that One World\u2019s content often parrots the Russian state agenda on issues including the war in Syria. A report published last month by a second, nongovernmental organization, Brussels-based EU DisinfoLab, examined links between InfoRos and One World to Russian military intelligence. The researchers identified technical clues tying their websites to Russia and identified some financial connections between InfoRos and the government. \u201cInfoRos is evolving in a shady grey zone, where regular information activities are mixed with more controversial actions that could be quite possibly linked to the Russian state\u2019s information operations,\u201d the report\u2019s authors concluded. On its English-language Facebook page, InfoRos describes itself as an \u201cInformation agency: world through the eyes of Russia.\u201d"}]}
