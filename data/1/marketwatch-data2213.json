Gavin Newsom's order earlier in the day mandating face masks for anyone leaving their home, with rare exceptions, in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19. \"This is 100% the right move,\" the onetime \"Governator\" said. \"This will help us beat this terrible virus. The science is unanimous - if we all wear masks, we slow down the spread and can reopen safely. It's not a political issue. Anyone making it a political issue is an absolute moron who can't read.\" iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Schwarzenegger, a Republican, served as California's governor from 2003-'11. Before Thursday, California cities and counties had been free to make masks mandatory, but Newsom said he issued a statewide order because too many people have been going out mask-less as businesses reopen. California has seen a recent increase in coronavirus cases, especially in Southern California. While face masks have become a political issue in the U.S., the science behind their effectiveness appears prettysolid. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends \"Everyone should wear a cloth face cover when they have to go out in public,\" and notes \"the cloth face cover is meant to protect other people in case you are infected.\" Read:'Shameful, not cool, a sign of weakness': Men are less likely to wear face masks to protect against coronavirus, study finds And for what it's worth, Schwarzenegger isn't the only action hero who's not too cool for a mask, as this photo of Harrison Ford shows: iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; }"}]}
