The company has yet to determine how many shares it would offer in an IPO and said that the offering is expected to take place after the SEC completes its review process. The company, which was founded by PayPal Holdings Inc. PYPL, +2.18% co-founder Max Levchin, announced a $500 million series G funding round back in September. Affirm plays into the hot buy-now, pay-later trend, in which shoppers can pay for purchases over time. Others in this space include Klarna, Afterpay Ltd. AFTPF, +2.20%, and PayPal, which recently introduced its own split-payments offering."}]}
