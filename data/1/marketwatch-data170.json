House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also rejected the idea of a standalone bill to aid the airline industry, saying such a measure would need to be part of a broader fiscal stimulus package.

Optimism has been building about the longer term prospects of another sweeping stimulus package from Washington, particularly in January following the elections. Indeed, even as talks between the White House and Democratic lawmakers have made scant progress, equities have managed to sustain steady gains this week. \u201cAny stock market weakness that stems from failure to break the impasse will be short-lived. The election is 25 days away, so it should come as no surprise Wall Street is already pricing in a blue wave that comes with higher taxes but also a massive $5 trillion spending plan that will provide a strong boost for the economy,\u201d said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA. Also, fears of a contested election, which could leave the outcome of the contest in doubt for weeks, have faded as polls show Democratic challenger Joe Biden increasing his lead over Trump, analysts said. Read: Stocks are rallying because fears of a contested election are fading While a Biden administration would aim to repeal Trump\u2019s corporate tax cuts and increase regulation across a number of industries, the potential for a drawn-out and divisive post-election fight has been viewed as a worst-case scenario by many investors. \u201cOur base case is a Biden win and Democrats sweeping Congress. In this scenario, the Democrats pursue a net fiscal stimulus that combines tax hikes with an elaborate spending plan on energy and climate change management,\u201d wrote analysts at Credit Suisse, in a note. Talks in Washington this week on additional coronavirus aid have yet to yield any fresh breakthroughs. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Pelosi, D-Calif., resumed negotiations Wednesday, after President Donald Trump tweeted the previous evening that he was open to piecemeal stimulus measures, including aid for airline workers. But on Thursday, Pelosi said she wouldn\u2019t back an independent package for airlines without a broader stimulus bill. \u201cThere is no stand-alone bill without a bigger bill. There is no bill,\u201d Pelosi told reporters at her weekly press conference at the U.S. Capitol. \u201cIt\u2019s likely that there will continue to be near-term volatility due to the back-and-forth over a deal, the U.S. elections, U.S.-China tensions, vaccine developments, and increasing mobility restrictions due to rising COVID-19 cases in Europe,\u201d said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a note. \u201cBut we do maintain a positive medium-term view for stocks into the middle of next year,\u201d he said. \u201cA stimulus deal will be struck eventually, central banks will continue to stay supportive, and medical developments still have scope to surprise, in our view.\u201d Meanwhile, initial jobless claims filed through state programs slipped to 840,000 in the week ended Oct. 3 from a revised 849,000 in the prior week, the Labor Department reported. Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast new claims to fall to 820,000. The slowing decline of the number of Americans who applied for jobless benefits could be a sign the labor market is experiencing a setback amid another wave of corporate layoffs.
