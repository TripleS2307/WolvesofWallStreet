Berkshire BRK.B, +0.24%  disclosed the investments in Mitsubishi Corp. 8058, -0.48%  , Mitsui & Co. 8031, +0.08%  , Sumitomo Corp. 8053, -1.02%  , Itochu Corp. 8001, -1.43%  and Marubeni Corp. 8002, -0.88%  just before the Tokyo stock market opened Monday. Shares in the five companies surged at least 5% and in some cases more than 10%, helping drive the overall Nikkei Stock Average NIK, -0.11%  up 2% in intraday trading Monday. Berkshire didn't say how much it spent to acquire the stakes. Based on the companies' Friday closing prices, a 5% stake in each would collectively be worth about $6 billion. The five are often called trading companies, but investment company might be a more precise description. All have stakes in a variety of businesses including interests in energy and mining. Mitsubishi and Itochu each control a major convenience-store chain in Japan. \"I am delighted to have Berkshire Hathaway participate in the future of Japan and the five companies we have chosen for investment,\" said Buffett in a statement. He said the five companies \"have many joint ventures throughout the world and are likely to have more of these partnerships.\" An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.
