Florida\u2019s Department of Health reported 15,299 people tested positive for COVID-19 on Sunday, bumping the total confirmed case tally for the Sunshine State to 269,811 cases, as the Associated Press reported. The previous record was 11,694 cases in a single day, set last week by California. In more bad news, Florida counted a record of 514 fatalities last week, compared with the average of 30 deaths a day the state was recording just three weeks ago. Testing has doubled in the past month to almost 50,000 a day from 25,000 and the percentage of people testing positive has risen to an average of 19% in the last week from few than 5% a month ago, the AP reported. Meanwhile, Arizona continues to clamor for help with testing as its hospitals are becoming overwhelmed. In Texas, the mayor of Houston Sylvester Turner and Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo, both Democrats, said a stay-at-home order is needed to help the city cope with its recent surge in cases. State health officials reported 8,196 new cases Sunday, another 80 deaths and a total of 10,410 people hospitalized due to the virus, as the AP reported. \u201cNot only do we need a stay home order now, but we need to stick with it this time until the hospitalization curve comes down, not just flattens,\u201d Hidalgo said on Twitter Sunday. \u201cMany communities that persevered in that way are reopening for the long haul. Let\u2019s learn from that & not make the same mistake twice.\u201d A 30-year old in Texas died after attending a so-called \u201cCOVID-19 party,\u201d telling nurses he thought the virus was a hoax, the New York Times reported. President Donald Trump wore a face mask while visiting a military hospital on Saturday, but his administration continued to criticize and point fingers at a key member of the White House Task Force set up to manage the pandemic. Trump himself got the ball rolling in an interview with Fox News Anchor Sean Hannity, in which he said Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases and the man deemed to be the nation\u2019s leading infectious-disease expert, \u201cis a nice man, but he\u2019s made a lot of mistakes.\u201d Adm. Brett Giroir said Sunday on NBC News show \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that Fauci \u201cis not 100% right, and he also doesn\u2019t necessarily, he admits that, have the whole national interest in mind.\u201d Giroir is testing coordinator at the Department of Health and Human Services, and was being questioned about a Washington Post report that said Fauci has argued states with spikes should shut down again. Giroir said he doesn\u2019t \u201cthink we need to shut down\u201d again \u2014 \u201cat least in most places around the country\u201d but suggested Americans \u201cavoid bars\u201d and \u201cwear a mask in public.\u201d Fauci is not the only public health expert arguing there is a need for another shutdown. \u201cSomehow we thought that we could basically win an argument with this virus and now we know we can\u2019t,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, head of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, in a weekend interview with MSNBC. On Monday, he said it\u2019s too late for people who have already become infected. \u201cThose people are already in the pipeline. The next two weeks ... that history is already written,\u201d Osterholm said in another MSNBC interview. \u201cLet me just say I\u2019m not a politician; I\u2019m a scientist. and frankly I\u2019m frustrated by this entire situation because the more minutes we spend talking about this, the less we\u2019re spending talking to people about distancing, about the importance of why cases even in young adults are leading to a number of intensive-care-unit hospitalizations and deaths, why what we have to do is make sure that when you\u2019re in indoor-air settings like bars and restaurants you put yourself at high risk of transmitting this virus, why it is so important,\u201d he said. Osterholm estimates that the number of Americans already infected is at 7% or 8%, far from the 50% to 70% required \u201cthat will be required to get infected or be vaccinated and be protected in order to slow this virus transmission down.\u201d Osterholm has consistently argued said the U.S. needs to go back to Square One, shut down, reopen gradually, like early hot spot New York and the rest of the world, and then live with COVID-19 until a vaccine has been developed On Monday, New York City officials reported the first day of zero COVID-19 deaths since the start of the outbreak. Latest tallies There are now 12.9 million cases of COVID-19 worldwide and the U.S. accounts for about a quarter or 3.31 million, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University.

Feldman expects that the service could turn profitable in fiscal 2021, while he said the consensus view is targeting fiscal 2023.
