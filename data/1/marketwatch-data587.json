Oracle, a giant in business software, has had preliminary discussions about teaming with some of ByteDance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existing minority investors to buy TikTok\u00e2\u0080\u0099s U.S. operations but it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t clear how advanced the talks are, said people familiar with the matter. Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +2.48% \u00c2 said earlier this month it was in negotiations with ByteDance, and that it was coordinating with the White House. Twitter Inc. TWTR, -0.23% \u00c2 is also exploring a bid, The Wall Street Journal previously reported. The Financial Times earlier reported Oracle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s involvement. Oracle has closer ties to the White House than most other parties involved in the bidding. Larry Ellison, the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s co-founder, chairman and largest shareholder, earlier this year threw a fundraiser at his house for the president. Chief Executive Safra Catz also worked on the executive committee for the Trump transition team in 2016. Asked Tuesday if Oracle would be a good buyer for TikTok, Trump said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell I think Oracle is a great company and I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s owner is a tremendous guy, a tremendous person. I think that Oracle would be certainly somebody that could handle it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.
