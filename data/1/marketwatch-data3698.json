Tremendous! Exciting! Encouraging! Significant! Incredible!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Others might use \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot nearly enough!\u00e2\u0080\u009d but, hey, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clearly not the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s style. He prefers the rosy superlatives, even if the circumstances might call for some sobering language. Twitter user Invictus, a markets veteran and contributor to \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Big Picture\u00e2\u0080\u009d blog, juxtaposed those \u00e2\u0080\u009cgreat\u00e2\u0080\u009d strides Trump has trumpeted over the past few months against the mounting death toll from COVID-19 in the United States.

Alas, the new Trump didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to last long, considering he retweeted a video claiming masks are of no use, while touting hydroxychloroquine. It was pulled from Facebook FB, +0.26% \u00c2 , Twitter TWTR, -0.23% and Google GOOG, +1.97% for spreading misinformation. Meanwhile, the U.S. tally for confirmed cases of COVID-19 climbed above 4.30 million on Tuesday, and the death toll exceeded 148,000, after Texas became the fourth state with more than 400,000 cases, joining California, Florida and early hot spot New York. The U.S. counted another 1,000 COVID-19 fatalities on Monday for a sixth straight day, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University."}]}
