Gold concluded the week on a positive note as \u201crising coronavirus cases in China and the United States accelerate the flight to safety,\u201d said Lukman Otunuga, senior research analyst at FXTM. \u201cThere is a thick smog of caution in the air with investors on high alert amid the COVID-19 developments [and] global sentiment still fragile despite equity markets edging higher,\u201d he told MarketWatch. \u201cExpect gold to shine through the smog and smoke over the coming weeks if risk aversion becomes a dominant market theme.\u201d Still, \u201can unyielding U.S. dollar\u201d may serve to cap gains for gold, said Otunuga. A stronger dollar can draw investors away from the metals, which is priced in dollars. In Friday dealings, the benchmark ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, -0.58% was up 0.2%, poised for a weekly rise of 0.3%. On Comex, August gold US:GCQ20 gained $21.90, or 1.3%, to settle at $1,753 an ounce, the highest finish for a most-active contract since mid-May, according to FactSet data. Prices ended around 0.9% higher for the week. July silver US:SIN20 also ended higher, up 34 cents, or 1.9%, at $17.847 an ounce, with prices posting a weekly rise of roughly 2.1%. In a research note dated Friday, Goldman Sachs raised its 12-month gold forecast by 11% to $2,000 an ounce citing low real interest rates and concerns over currency debasement. Peter Spina, president and chief executive officer at GoldSeek.com, referred to the forecast as a \u201cstrong promotion from Goldman Sachs,\u201d following sideways trading for gold in the last couple of months. The metal is \u201clooking to make a resolution to this consolidation soon,\u201d priming for its next run higher and $1,900 to $2,000 becomes the next upside target,\u201d Spina told MarketWatch. \u201cThe global central banks all have tool boxes of monetary debasement which is making gold increasingly more and more interesting as a low-risk store of value. Gold is returning to its historical role of preserving wealth.\u201d The move for precious metals come even as stocks, which tend to move in the opposite direction of gold, moved up for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% and the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% were down in Friday dealings as gold futures settled, but stayed on track for weekly gains. Rounding out action among Comex metals, July copper US:HGN20 gained 0.9%, at $2.611 a pound\u2014ending 0.4% higher for the week. July platinum US:PLN20 rose 1.9% to $827.30 an ounce, contributing to a weekly rise of 1%. September palladium US:PAU20 settled at $1,908.40 an ounce, down 20 cents for the session\u2014to lose about 1.6% for the week."}]}
