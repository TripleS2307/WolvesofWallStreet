Apparently, that last one doesn\u2019t quite qualify as a permissible cost under the Paycheck Protection Program, but that allegedly didn\u2019t stop one Florida man from putting some of his coronavirus aid money toward buying a $318,000 Hurac\u00e1n EVO. David Hines, whose business was in the red by more than $30,000, received a $4 million loan from the government and soon took to the streets of Miami Beach in his fancy Italian sports car. As if the Lambo wasn\u2019t enough, Hines also splashed $4,600 while shopping at Saks Fifth Avenue as well as thousands more on fancy hotels and jewelry, according to the Washington Post. Maybe, just maybe, he should have kept a lower profile. Hines was arrested and charged with making false statements to a lending institution, bank fraud and engaging in transactions in unlawful proceeds. \u201cCollectively, Hines falsely claimed his companies paid millions of dollars in payroll in the first quarter of 2020,\u201d Bryan Masmela, a U.S. Postal inspector, said in an affidavit. \u201cState and bank records, however, show little to no payroll expense during this period.\u201d A lawyer for Hines said he\u2019s \u201canxious\u201d to tell his side of the story. \u201cDavid is a legitimate business owner who, like millions of Americans, suffered financially during the pandemic,\u201d he told the Post, while acknowledging the severity of the allegations. The Miami Herald reported that federal investigators linked Hines with the sports car after he was involved in a hit-and-run accident earlier this month. When the bank froze Hines\u2019 corporate accounts, they showed a balance of $3,463,162 but no repayments on the loans."}]}
