The Japanese convenience-store operator said net profit fell to 72.52 billion yen ($684.3 million) for the six-month period ended August from Y110.65 billion a year earlier. Second-quarter net profit was Y58.58 billion, given net profit of Y13.94 billion in its first quarter, according to a Wall Street Journal calculation. That beat the estimate of Y51.02 billion from a FactSet poll of analysts. First-half operating profit rose 3.8% for its overseas convenience-store business but dropped 12% for its domestic convenience-store business. First-half revenue declined 16% to Y2.788 trillion. Second-quarter revenue was Y1.397 trillion, given revenue of Y1.392 trillion in its first quarter. Seven & I raised its revenue and net profit forecasts for the year ending February, citing some signs of a recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. It expects revenue to fall 13% to Y5.759 trillion, compared with the previous forecast of a 14% drop, and it expects net profit to drop 37% to Y138.50 billion, compared with the previous view of a 45% decline.
