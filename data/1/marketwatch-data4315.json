Profits for the first six months of the year plunged to $23.2 billion, half of last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s $46.9 billion for the same time period. The results were announced as Aramco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2222, +0.55% \u00c2 second quarter earnings dipped to $6.6 billion compared to $24.7 billion during the same time last year, reflecting a staggering 73% drop. The majority state-owned company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial health is crucial to Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stability. Despite massive efforts by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to diversify the economy, Saudi Arabia still depends heavily on oil exports to fuel government spending. The price of Brent crude UK:BRNV20 \u00c2 hovers just under $45 a barrel, significantly less than before the pandemic but up from a low of around $21 a barrel in April. Aramco CEO Amin Nasser acknowledged the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s finances were impacted by \u00e2\u0080\u009cstrong headwinds from reduced demand and lower oil prices\u00e2\u0080\u009d sparked by the pandemic, which halted flights around the world and plunged economies into recession, including Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. The company said it will uphold its commitment to pay out dividends of $18.75 billion for the second quarter as part of its promise to pay $75 billion in annual dividends. Nasser described Aramco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s half-year earnings as \u00e2\u0080\u009csolid\u00e2\u0080\u009d and credited the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s low production costs and operational strength, which helped it to maintain its promised dividend payments. Aramco was knocked out of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top spot as the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most valuable listed company by Apple AAPL, +1.74% \u00c2 in recent days. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stock price gained a little on Sunday, trading at around 33 riyals ($8.80) a share. At its highest, Aramco traded above $10 a share in December and at it lowest slipped to $7.20 a share in March. Looking ahead, Nasser said the energy market is seeing a partial recovery as countries around the world ease restrictions and reboot their economies. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are determined to emerge from the pandemic stronger and will continue making progress on our long-term strategic journey, through ongoing investments in our business,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nasser said. Even before the half-year results were announced, it was clear Aramco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s half-year earnings would take a hit with the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first quarter profits down 25%. Aramco, which floated a sliver of its shares on the local Saudi stock market last year, had long kept its financial details a closely-held secret until the company began preparations for its market debut."}]}
