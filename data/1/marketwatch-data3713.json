The FTSE 100 betting and gambling group said it was informed on Monday that HM Revenue & Customs was widening the scope of its investigation. Prior to Monday, it had been understood that no GVC entity was subject to the investigation launched by HMRC last year, the company said. GVC said it understood that the probe was directed at former third-party suppliers, relating to the processing of payments for online gambling in Turkey. GVC, which sold its Turkish-facing business in December 2017, said it continues to co-operate fully with HMRC. The company said it is surprised by the decision to extend the investigation and disappointed by the lack of clarity provided by HMRC, which hasn't yet provided details of the nature of the conduct it is investigating."}]}
