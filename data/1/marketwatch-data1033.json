What I said is \u00e2\u0080\u0098We have to be calm. We can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be panicked,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said, after a reporter asked him: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy did you lie?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said the question\u00e2\u0080\u0099s phrasing was \u00e2\u0080\u009ca disgrace.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The president then was asked why he told Woodward that COVID-19 was worse than the most strenuous flu, but then told the public that it was just like the flu. Trump said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat I went out and said was very simple. I want to show a level of confidence and I want to show strength as a leader, and I want to show that our country is going to be fine one way or another.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump then repeated a view that he tweeted about earlier in the day, saying that Woodward could have reported on his comments sooner. And at the start of the news conference at the White House, Trump sounded upbeat about the coronavirus crisis. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI really do believe we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re rounding the corner, and the vaccines are right there. But not even discussing vaccines, and not discussing therapeutics, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re rounding the corner,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.
