What I said is 'We have to be calm. We can't be panicked,'\" Trump said, after a reporter asked him: \"Why did you lie?\" Trump said the question's phrasing was \"a disgrace.\" The president then was asked why he told Woodward that COVID-19 was worse than the most strenuous flu, but then told the public that it was just like the flu. Trump said: \"What I went out and said was very simple. I want to show a level of confidence and I want to show strength as a leader, and I want to show that our country is going to be fine one way or another.\" Trump then repeated a view that he tweeted about earlier in the day, saying that Woodward could have reported on his comments sooner. And at the start of the news conference at the White House, Trump sounded upbeat about the coronavirus crisis. \"I really do believe we're rounding the corner, and the vaccines are right there. But not even discussing vaccines, and not discussing therapeutics, we're rounding the corner,\" he said.
