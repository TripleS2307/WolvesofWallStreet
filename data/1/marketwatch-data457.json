Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg testified remotely at a contentious July hearing before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law. Getty Images Big Tech poses a grave threat to markets that might require breaking up the most prominent U.S. tech companies and limiting their acquisitions, concluded a House subcommittee report issued Tuesday. The House Judiciary Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law Subcommittee has held hearings for more than a year to investigate the business practices of Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Apple Inc. AAPL, Facebook Inc. FB, and Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL GOOG Last week, the Judiciary subcommittee held its seventh and final hearing, and issued a withering report on the companies\u2019 actions Tuesday. \u201cTo put it simply, companies that once were scrappy, underdog startups that challenged the status quo have become the kinds of monopolies we last saw in the era of oil barons and railroad tycoons,\u201d Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., chairman of the House Judiciary Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law Subcommittee, said in a statement accompanying the report. \u201cAlthough these firms have delivered clear benefits to society, the dominance of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google has come at a price.\u201d The 449-page report suggests breaking apart tech companies in an effort to separate businesses so they do not benefit each other and potentially harm competition, as well as other potential measures. \u201cThese firms typically run the marketplace while also competing in it \u2014 a position that enables them to write one set of rules for others, while they play by another, or to engage in a form of their own private quasi regulation that is unaccountable to anyone but themselves,\u201d Cicilline said. Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, a ranking member of the committee who has frequently invoked charges of anti-conservative bias against Silicon Valley, had a different view. \u201cBig tech is out to get conservatives,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cUnfortunately, the Democrats\u2019 partisan report ignores this fundamental problem and potential solutions and instead advances radical proposals that would refashion antitrust law in the vision of the far left.\u201d The report also suggests that Congress decree that \u201cany acquisition by a dominant platform would be presumed anticompetitive unless the merging parties could show that the transaction was necessary for serving the public interest and that similar benefits could not be achieved through internal growth and expansion.\u201d The most contentious hearing came in late July, when the chief executives of all four companies faced a barrage of piercing questions about their market power and business strategies.

They discourage entrepreneurship, destroy jobs, hike costs, and degrade quality. Simply put: They have too much power. This power staves off new forms of competition, creativity, and innovation.\u201d While some tech observers initially called the recommendations overly ambitious, others said they may be merely providing broad guidelines to potential reforms in the next Congress. \u201cMy biggest concern is it tries to do too much by effectively addressing privacy, competition, and free speech,\u201d said Will Rinehart, senior research fellow at Center for Growth and Opportunities, an economic research firm. \u201cI hoped it would be more focused on competition.\u201d If the Democrats win control of the Senate, and maintain a majority in the House following the Nov. 3 elections, the party is widely expected to ramp up investigations and legislation of Big Tech. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut are expected to lead the political charge.

David Cicilline and House Democrats do not understand the extraordinary value that so-called \u201cBig Tech\u201d digital platforms deliver to our economy, and most importantly, to small businesses during the COVID-19 recession,\u201d Jake Ward, president of the Connected Commerce Council, said in a statement. \u201cAmid a global pandemic that has cost American lives, decimated the U.S. economy, and disrupted our way of life, small business tools and services made by America\u2019s leading technology companies are helping millions of Main Street businesses adapt and survive,\u201d Ward said. News of the report sent shares of Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook, and Apple down in trading Tuesday amid President Trump\u2019s avowal to end stimulus negotiations until after the election. Amazon\u2019s stock took the biggest hit, dropping 3%. Apple was down 2.9%, while Facebook declined 2.3%, and Google slid 2.1%. Despite a sell-off by jittery investors on Tuesday, Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said he believes tech stocks could rally another 15% by the end of the year, led by Apple, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +2.48%, Salesforce.com Inc. CRM, +2.21%, and others. \u201cWhile the political landscape remains in flux, regardless of a Biden or Trump Presidency, we continue to see the path higher for tech stocks given the underlying fundamental drivers that should be front and center during 3Q earnings over the coming weeks with no signs of slowing down heading into 2021,\u201d Ives said in a note late Tuesday."}]}
