AFP via Getty Images Amazon.com Inc. aims to open as many as 1,500 small warehouses across the U.S. \u2014 many of them in suburban locations \u2014 as it raises the stakes in its battle against Walmart, according to report. The Seattle-based retail giant, which was caught flat-footed during the pandemic when it couldn\u2019t keep up with demand for basic items like toilet paper and milk, is ramping up its delivery capabilities with more hubs in cities and suburbs, according to a Bloomberg report. Amazon AMZN, +3.01% chief executive Jeff Bezos is investing billions in these new warehouses and in improving the company\u2019s transportation capabilities, Bloomberg said. As demand for online goods surged in the early days of the pandemic, Amazon struggled fulfill its two-day delivery promise to Prime members. But it has since hired 175,000 workers who have gotten the company back on track. Walmart WMT, +1.00% and Target TGT, +1.14% have also upped their game with same-day delivery via their vast network of stores, with Walmart recently launching Walmart Plus, its answer to Amazon Prime.

Struggling department stores that are closing sites, including JCPenney, are an \u201coption of last resort\u201d for the Seattle-based giant, according to the report, which cited anonymous sources.
