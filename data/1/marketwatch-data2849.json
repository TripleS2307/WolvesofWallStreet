It just seems that the virus replicates better and may be more transmissible. But this is still at the stage of trying to confirm that,\" said Fauci. The study he references, released by researchers affiliated with the Sheffield COVID-19 Genomics Group, states that the new strain \"has become the most prevalent form in the global pandemic,\" and that it differs from the one that struck Wuhan, China, late last year."}]}
