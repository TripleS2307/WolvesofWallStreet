He sees margin risk heading into calendar 2021 given a higher bill of materials, driving up the cost of making 5G iPhones, as well as the potential for unit volumes to take a hit if Apple opts for higher retail prices to make up for the rising materials costs. Mohan also sees \"tough compares in 2021 from an unsustainable trajectory (30% growth) of high margin App Store growth\" and pressure on services gross margins due to content amortization costs. He raised his price target on the stock to $470 from $420 in conjunction with the downgrade. Apple shares are up 0.5% in Wednesday morning trading and they've gained 48% over the past three months as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% has increased 13%."}]}
