Bank of America analysts expect global online grocery sales to reach $705 billion by 2025, triple the sales of 2019. \u201cThe sector faces bigger challenges than non-food sectors when it comes to building a successful home delivery model, such as short sell-by dates, and fragile and varying food characteristics (e.g., temperature),\u201d analysts wrote in a detailed report on COVID-19\u2019s impact on the accelerated shift to e-commerce. \u201cHowever, the sector has grown exponentially given investment by grocers in \u2018click and collect\u2019 and home delivery services and societal change towards quicker shopping.\u201d Analysts note that in the U.S., online grocery growth has been through the roof, up 183% in April, for example. However, it started from a low point. The U.S. accounts for 17% of global grocery sales value.

Fulfilling orders for home delivery is expensive, and making in-store pick-up work also means finding a way to do so without disrupting customers who are doing their own shopping at a store location. \u201cOnline grocery is as a result dilutive to already thin retailer operating margins,\u201d Bank of America said. A Moody\u2019s report published Tuesday makes that point as well. \u201cWe expect online sales to remain higher than they were before the pandemic, even for retail categories where fewer purchases were made online, like food and consumables,\u201d analysts wrote. \u201cThis is because consumers have become increasingly comfortable with internet shopping. As growth slows, the longer-term credit challenge for grocers will remain how to preserve margins despite the rising adoption of lower-margin online shopping.\u201d Watch: Why retail bankruptcies won\u2019t necessarily create a \u2018retail apocalypse\u2019 Overall, Bank of America analysts say that there\u2019s been a $480 billion shift in value to e-commerce, which will continue to drive the store closures that consumers and investors have already seen across a variety of categories. Bank of America forecasts an 8% decline in store numbers between 2019 and 2025. For clothing and shoes, online penetration will reach 40% by 2025, according to Bank of America calculations, up from 20% in 2019. E-commerce had already been accelerating in the U.S. before the coronavirus but the pandemic quickly became \u201cthe largest accelerator of e-commerce\u201d around the world in a decade, with online penetration in the U.S. moving to 31.5% in April 2020 from 19% in January 2020. Even with this movement across the spectrum of online shopping, a CommerceHub report, \u201cCOVID-19 Consumer Retail Trends: 6 Months Later,\u201d shows that grocery stores are still frequented by customers more than stores that carry other goods. Also: Beyond Meat, Incogmeato, Impossible Foods up ante in plant-based meat market More than 60% of those who participated in an August survey of 2,000 U.S. consumers said they \u201cseldom\u201d go to a store other than a grocer. In part, that might have something to do with what\u2019s available and what\u2019s convenient. Another survey of nearly 2,600 consumers, conducted by San Francisco-based online grocery delivery service Good Eggs, found that many of those customers who are ordering groceries and having them delivered are also going to the store, picking up orders curbside and also buying meal kits. \u201cThe downside of shopping online includes the lack of available items or difficulty finding the items they want (45%), getting poor quality foods they wouldn\u2019t have picked themselves (41%), and receiving the wrong items in, or having items missing from, their orders (39%),\u201d Good Eggs found. For online grocery shopping, Good Eggs found that Walmart Inc. WMT, +1.00% is the top choice followed by Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +3.01%, either through Prime or Whole Foods Market, followed by Instacart and regional grocery stores that have their own online delivery offering, like Safeway and Wegeman\u2019s. Bank of America analysts also note the digital momentum at grocers like Kroger Co. KR, +0.46% and Albertsons Cos. Inc. ACI, +1.71% \u201cGrocery online should today be seen as an opportunity for faster growth and market share gains for those food retailers willing and able to grab the opportunity,\u201d analysts said. Don\u2019t miss: Target to host Deal Days shopping event during Amazon Prime Day One key part of the developmental process will be finding a business model that works for companies and consumers alike. \u201cHome delivery is not a viable solution if not charged and in-store pick is not productive enough while disruptive for in-store customers,\u201d Bank of America wrote. \u201cDeveloping an economically viable model has been the reason for slow entry and progress in grocery online.\u201d"}]}
