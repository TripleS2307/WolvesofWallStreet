The Food and Drug Administration in August had issued an emergency use authorization to convalescent plasma, which is gathered from people who have recovered from COVID-19, in a move touted by the Trump administration. The FDA commissioner later had to backtrack on comments he made about the benefits of convalescent plasma to the public, tweeting that he should have said the data indicated \"a relative risk reduction not an absolute risk reduction.\" \"There are insufficient data to recommend either for or against the use of convalescent plasma for the treatment of COVID-19,\" the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel said in a statement."}]}
