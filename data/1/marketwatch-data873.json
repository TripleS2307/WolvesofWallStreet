House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told MSNBC she hoped the news would bring a complete shift in the U.S. approach to managing the pandemic. \"Maybe now that people that see that the president of the United States, and all the protection he has, and the first lady, having this exposure, it might be a learning experience\" she said. \"And more than learning, it has to be something that is acted upon.\" Pelosi criticized Trump's attitude to the illness as cavalier. \"Going into crowds unmasked and all the rest was a sort of brazen invitation for something like this to happen\" she said. \"It's sad that it did, but it's nonetheless hopeful that it will be a saner transition to what this virus all about.\" iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat who was in the audience for Tuesday's presidential debate, echoed that sentiment: \"This is a reminder that all of us are vulnerable to this dangerous virus and should follow public health guidelines about mask wearing, social distancing, and more,\" Coons said in a statement, CNN reported. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, said she hoped the news would serve as a wake-up call to every single American. \"Here's the good news. We can beat this enemy - but it's going to take every single one of us working together to do it. Right now the most effective weapon we have is pretty simple: it's wearing a mask that covers your nose and mouth. It's washing your hands with soap and water. And maintaining six feet of physical distance from one another.\" See: President Trump tested positive for coronavirus - here's everything we know so far The news came after White House adviser Hope Hicks, who had traveled with Trump earlier this week, tested positive and sparked a scramble to test others in the White House and beyond, including Trump's presidential rival, Democrat Joe Biden. See:Tracking Trump: Where the president was and whom he came in contact with before announcing his positive coronavirus test Both Trump and Biden are in the high-risk category as they are both in their 70s. Trump's weight likely places him in the obesity camp, another high-risk factor, while there have been recent concerns about his health based on videos of him stumbling while walking and appearing to exhibit slurred speech.

Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, which Trump has attacked for its handling of the pandemic, sent his best wishes to the president and his wife. See now:As Trump says he is positive for coronavirus, a look back at his shifting statements on face masks and the threat of COVID-19 The news came on a day when the U.S. counted another 46,459 new infections and at least 847 deaths, according to a New York Times tracker. In the past week, the daily count has averaged 43,439 a day, up 8% from the average two weeks earlier. The U.S. has lost 208,304 people to the virus, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University, or about a fifth of the global toll of 1.03 million. Experts have for months lamented the U.S.'s failure to adopt the testing, contact tracing and isolation that have allowed some countries to contain the spread, and to persuade the public of the need to fully comply with the recommended safety measures. Trump confided to journalist Bob Woodward that he has publicly downplayed the virus. Trump has insisted it would disappear, touted unproven and even harmful treatments, and derided Biden for wearing a face mask. That in turn has created mistrust among his supporters and led to protests against face masks in many states. Now hospitalizations are on the rise again and have hit their highest levels since May in nine states in the past week, according to the Washington Post. At least four states - Missouri, Montana, North Dakota and Wyoming - hit record levels since the newspaper started tracking them. Don't miss:Trump's coronavirus diagnosis underscores lack of treatment options for people with mild forms of COVID-19 In other news: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Credit-rating agency Moody's Investors Service on Thursday downgraded New York City's debt by one notch, citing \"substantial financial challenges,\" faced by the metropolis amid the worst pandemic in more than a century. COVID-19 has delivered a gut punch to the city of 19 million people. Moody's downgraded the Big Apple's $38.7 billion in general obligation bonds to Aa2 from Aa1, the equivalent of a move in competitor ratings firm Standard & Poor's of a fall to AA from AA+, or two notches below the pristine triple-A rating. Moody's said that it believes that the city is on a \"longer recovery path than most other major cities.\" The agency also said that the city may face \"lasting economic consequences\" and require \"significant fiscal adjustments.\" \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 New York state officials have launched Covid Alert NY, an app that will warn New Yorkers if they've spent more than 10 minutes within 6 feet of other app users, creating a network of \"close contacts\" who can easily be notified of exposure if one of them later tests positive for the virus. \"This is a technology-based contact tracing app,\" Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a statement. \"Testing is only as good as your contact tracing.\" Cuomo made the announcement in partnership with New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy. New York and New Jersey will now join Pennsylvania and Delaware in a regional app network that will work across state lines to help stop the spread. Connecticut is expected to join the network in the coming weeks. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Australia has announced plans for a limited travel bubble with New Zealand, the BBC reported. New Zealanders will be allowed to travel to the Australian regions of New South Wales and the Northern Territory without requiring quarantine. \"This is the first stage in what we hope to see as a trans-Tasman bubble between the two countries, not just that state and that territory,\" said Australian Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack. New Zealanders will still have to quarantine on the way back, and for now Australians are not being granted access to New Zealand. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Amazon.com Inc. said than 19,000 of its workers - out of the 1.37 million it employs worldwide - have tested positive for COVID-19 or are presumed to have had the virus, MarketWatch's Jon Swartz reported. \"We have been conservative in this analysis. First, we cast a wide net by including both confirmed and presumptive cases in the Amazon figures,\" the e-commerce giant said in blog post disclosing a data analysis. \"Second, actual COVID-19 rates in the general population are greater than the official counts because not everyone in the general public gets screened for symptoms or tested.\" Amazon employees are regularly screened for symptoms and are increasingly being tested at work, regardless of whether they are showing symptoms, to identify asymptomatic cases, according to the company.Latest tallies There are now 34.4 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, the Johns Hopkins data show, and at least 23.9 million people have recovered. The U.S. leads the world as measured by cases and deaths. Brazil has the second highest death toll at 144,680, but third highest case tally at 4.8 million. India is second to the U.S. by case tally at 6.4 million, and has the third highest death toll at 99,773. Mexico is fourth with 78,078 deaths and seventh with 748,315 cases. The U.K. has 42,358 deaths and 469,762 cases, the highest death toll in Europe and fifth highest in the world. China, where the illness was first reported late last year, has had 90,567 cases and 4,739 fatalities, according to its official numbers. What's the latest medical news? Promising new clinical data for an experimental COVID-19 treatment hints at a secondary but possibly more important takeaway for investors: that, if this neutralizing antibody treatment works in coronavirus patients, so will the vaccines that are in development, as MarketWatch's Jaimy Lee reported. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. REGN, +0.36%  on Tuesday shared preliminary data from a Phase 1/2/3 clinical trial for REGN-COV2, finding that the investigational therapy reduced viral load and made symptoms go away sooner in some nonhospitalized patients with mild or moderate cases of COVID-19. It was most effective in patients with higher viral loads who had not tested positive for antibodies. \"We believe our data will have positive implications for the likelihood of success of vaccines that target the same spike protein that REGN-COV2 targets,\" Regeneron CEO Leonard Schleifer told investors on Tuesday, according to a FactSet transcript of the call. See now:There are seven coronavirus vaccine candidates being tested in the U.S. - here's where they stand Moderna Inc.'s MRNA, +0.09%  potential coronavirus vaccine will not be ready by the U.S. presidential election, the biotech company's chief executive told the Financial Times, as MarketWatch's Mike Murphy reported. CEO St\u00c3\u00a9phane Bancel told the FT in an interview that Moderna - a front-runner in the COVID-19 vaccine race - will not seek emergency-use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration until Nov. 25 at the earliest and does not expect to have secured approval for distribution of the vaccine to the general public until spring 2021. \"I think a late [first quarter], early [second quarter] approval is a reasonable timeline, based on what we know from our vaccine,\" Bancel told the FT. Pfizer Inc. PFE, -0.27%  CEO Albert Bourla told employees that development of its COVID-19 vaccine would move \"at the speed of science\" rather than due to political pressure, the Associated Press reported. The AP cited an internal letter. Pfizer and BioNTech BNTX, +1.23%  have an experimental coronavirus vaccine that is currently in Phase 3 trials. There are three other vaccine candidates in late-stage trials in the U.S., and Trump has repeatedly said that a vaccine may be ready by November, referring at least twice to Election Day, Nov. 3, as a \"special date\" by which time a vaccine could be available. LabCorp. LH, +0.77%  has been granted an emergency-use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for a new type of molecular test for COVID-19. The new test uses heat and technology to extract RNA from samples collected for COVID-19 testing and can improve the efficiency of testing, the company said in a statement. \"The innovative heat extraction process, which has comparable sensitivity to current extraction methods, traps viral particles, eliminating the need for RNA extraction reagents to capture and concentrate viral nucleic acid,\" said the statement. An emergency-use authorization is not a full FDA approval. What's the economy saying? The U.S. created 661,000 new jobs in September and the unemployment rate fell again to 7.9% to the lowest level of the pandemic, but the gain in hiring was the smallest since the economy reopened and pointed to deceleration in the recovery, MarketWatch's Jeffry Bartash reported. The increase in employment last month fell short of Wall Street's estimate. Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast a recapturing in September of some 800,000 lost jobs. Private-sector hiring was somewhat stronger, with 877,000 new jobs created, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday. What dragged down employment in September was a decline in public-educations jobs at local schools and state colleges. Most have adopted forms of online learning. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, fell for the fifth month in row to 7.9% from 8.4%, a new pandemic low. The official jobless rate had peaked at 14.7% in April before its ongoing decline. \"This underscores that job gains from here on will be tougher, and speaks to the need for more stimulus to help the economy and to support the more than 11 million Americans who had jobs in February and who are unemployed now,\" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union.

The final consumer-sentiment survey in September climbed to 80.4 from a preliminary reading of 78.9, the University of Michigan said Friday. It was also up from August's 74.1 score. The index now sits at the highest level since the pandemic erupted in March, mirroring the results of other household surveys. Earlier this week the Conference Board said its consumer-confidence index shot up to a pandemic-period high.What are companies saying? \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Activision Blizzard Inc. ATVI, +0.52%  is delaying the release of its \"World of Warcraft: Shadowlands\" installments to continue beta testing the game. The company's Blizzard division had expected to release the update to the massive multiplayer online role-playing game at the end of October but is opting to release it \"later this year.\" \"Blizzard is extending the beta test and iterating based on great input from players, focusing on endgame-related tuning and polishing efforts that have been partially slowed due to the team working from home during the ongoing pandemic,\" the company said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 General Motors Co.'s GM, -0.15%  third-quarter total automobile sales fell 10%, but the company said there were \"signs of recovery\" in the auto industry and highlighted its September sales. GM delivered 665,192 vehicles in the quarter, a 10% drop compared with the year-ago period, but sales improved each month within the three-month span during the pandemic. The industry and GM sales \"rebounded significantly in September, finishing the month with year-over-year sales increases,\" the company said. Retail sales also were a reason for optimism and GM said its pickup trucks and SUVs \"are selling extremely fast.\" GM \"remains focused on producing the right mix of vehicles to meet demand. Large pickup and full-size SUV plants are all operating on three shifts and at maximum overtime,\" it said. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Marathon Oil Corp. MRO, -2.74%  is reinstating its dividend despite the pressures created by the pandemic and slumping oil price. The company took recent debt-reduction measures aiming for a \"transparent framework for future capital allocation and uses of free cash flow intended to maximize long-term shareholder value.\" The dividend returned at 3 cents a share, payable on Dec. 10 to stockholders of record on Nov. 18. \"Marathon Oil continues to maintain a solid balance sheet,\" the company said. \"While 2020 has included its fair share of challenges, we believe we have successfully repositioned our company for success in a lower, more volatile commodity price environment,\" Chief Executive Lee Tillman said in a statement."}]}
