House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told MSNBC she hoped the news would bring a complete shift in the U.S. approach to managing the pandemic. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaybe now that people that see that the president of the United States, and all the protection he has, and the first lady, having this exposure, it might be a learning experience\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd more than learning, it has to be something that is acted upon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pelosi criticized Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attitude to the illness as cavalier. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGoing into crowds unmasked and all the rest was a sort of brazen invitation for something like this to happen\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sad that it did, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nonetheless hopeful that it will be a saner transition to what this virus all about.\u00e2\u0080\u009d iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat who was in the audience for Tuesday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidential debate, echoed that sentiment: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a reminder that all of us are vulnerable to this dangerous virus and should follow public health guidelines about mask wearing, social distancing, and more,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Coons said in a statement, CNN reported. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, said she hoped the news would serve as a wake-up call to every single American. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the good news. We can beat this enemy \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to take every single one of us working together to do it. Right now the most effective weapon we have is pretty simple: it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wearing a mask that covers your nose and mouth. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s washing your hands with soap and water. And maintaining six feet of physical distance from one another.\u00e2\u0080\u009d See: President Trump tested positive for coronavirus \u00e2\u0080\u0094 here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s everything we know so far The news came after White House adviser Hope Hicks, who had traveled with Trump earlier this week, tested positive and sparked a scramble to test others in the White House and beyond, including Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidential rival, Democrat Joe Biden. See:Tracking Trump: Where the president was and whom he came in contact with before announcing his positive coronavirus test Both Trump and Biden are in the high-risk category as they are both in their 70s. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weight likely places him in the obesity camp, another high-risk factor, while there have been recent concerns about his health based on videos of him stumbling while walking and appearing to exhibit slurred speech.

Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, which Trump has attacked for its handling of the pandemic, sent his best wishes to the president and his wife. See now:As Trump says he is positive for coronavirus, a look back at his shifting statements on face masks and the threat of COVID-19 The news came on a day when the U.S. counted another 46,459 new infections and at least 847 deaths, according to a New York Times tracker. In the past week, the daily count has averaged 43,439 a day, up 8% from the average two weeks earlier. The U.S. has lost 208,304 people to the virus, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University, or about a fifth of the global toll of 1.03 million. Experts have for months lamented the U.S.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s failure to adopt the testing, contact tracing and isolation that have allowed some countries to contain the spread, and to persuade the public of the need to fully comply with the recommended safety measures. Trump confided to journalist Bob Woodward that he has publicly downplayed the virus. Trump has insisted it would disappear, touted unproven and even harmful treatments, and derided Biden for wearing a face mask. That in turn has created mistrust among his supporters and led to protests against face masks in many states. Now hospitalizations are on the rise again and have hit their highest levels since May in nine states in the past week, according to the Washington Post. At least four states \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Missouri, Montana, North Dakota and Wyoming \u00e2\u0080\u0094 hit record levels since the newspaper started tracking them. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss:Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coronavirus diagnosis underscores lack of treatment options for people with mild forms of COVID-19 In other news: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Credit-rating agency Moody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Investors Service on Thursday downgraded New York City\u00e2\u0080\u0099s debt by one notch, citing \u00e2\u0080\u009csubstantial financial challenges,\u00e2\u0080\u009d faced by the metropolis amid the worst pandemic in more than a century. COVID-19 has delivered a gut punch to the city of 19 million people. Moody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s downgraded the Big Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s $38.7 billion in general obligation bonds to Aa2 from Aa1, the equivalent of a move in competitor ratings firm Standard & Poor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s of a fall to AA from AA+, or two notches below the pristine triple-A rating. Moody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s said that it believes that the city is on a \u00e2\u0080\u009clonger recovery path than most other major cities.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The agency also said that the city may face \u00e2\u0080\u009clasting economic consequences\u00e2\u0080\u009d and require \u00e2\u0080\u009csignificant fiscal adjustments.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 New York state officials have launched Covid Alert NY, an app that will warn New Yorkers if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve spent more than 10 minutes within 6 feet of other app users, creating a network of \u00e2\u0080\u009cclose contacts\u00e2\u0080\u009d who can easily be notified of exposure if one of them later tests positive for the virus. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a technology-based contact tracing app,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTesting is only as good as your contact tracing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cuomo made the announcement in partnership with New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy. New York and New Jersey will now join Pennsylvania and Delaware in a regional app network that will work across state lines to help stop the spread. Connecticut is expected to join the network in the coming weeks. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Australia has announced plans for a limited travel bubble with New Zealand, the BBC reported. New Zealanders will be allowed to travel to the Australian regions of New South Wales and the Northern Territory without requiring quarantine. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is the first stage in what we hope to see as a trans-Tasman bubble between the two countries, not just that state and that territory,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Australian Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack. New Zealanders will still have to quarantine on the way back, and for now Australians are not being granted access to New Zealand. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Amazon.com Inc. said than 19,000 of its workers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 out of the 1.37 million it employs worldwide \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have tested positive for COVID-19 or are presumed to have had the virus, MarketWatch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Jon Swartz reported. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have been conservative in this analysis. First, we cast a wide net by including both confirmed and presumptive cases in the Amazon figures,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the e-commerce giant said in blog post disclosing a data analysis. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSecond, actual COVID-19 rates in the general population are greater than the official counts because not everyone in the general public gets screened for symptoms or tested.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Amazon employees are regularly screened for symptoms and are increasingly being tested at work, regardless of whether they are showing symptoms, to identify asymptomatic cases, according to the company.Latest tallies There are now 34.4 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, the Johns Hopkins data show, and at least 23.9 million people have recovered. The U.S. leads the world as measured by cases and deaths. Brazil has the second highest death toll at 144,680, but third highest case tally at 4.8 million. India is second to the U.S. by case tally at 6.4 million, and has the third highest death toll at 99,773. Mexico is fourth with 78,078 deaths and seventh with 748,315 cases. The U.K. has 42,358 deaths and 469,762 cases, the highest death toll in Europe and fifth highest in the world. China, where the illness was first reported late last year, has had 90,567 cases and 4,739 fatalities, according to its official numbers. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the latest medical news? Promising new clinical data for an experimental COVID-19 treatment hints at a secondary but possibly more important takeaway for investors: that, if this neutralizing antibody treatment works in coronavirus patients, so will the vaccines that are in development, as MarketWatch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Jaimy Lee reported. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. REGN, +0.36% \u00c2 on Tuesday shared preliminary data from a Phase 1/2/3 clinical trial for REGN-COV2, finding that the investigational therapy reduced viral load and made symptoms go away sooner in some nonhospitalized patients with mild or moderate cases of COVID-19. It was most effective in patients with higher viral loads who had not tested positive for antibodies. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe believe our data will have positive implications for the likelihood of success of vaccines that target the same spike protein that REGN-COV2 targets,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Regeneron CEO Leonard Schleifer told investors on Tuesday, according to a FactSet transcript of the call. See now:There are seven coronavirus vaccine candidates being tested in the U.S. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where they stand Moderna Inc.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s MRNA, +0.09% \u00c2 potential coronavirus vaccine will not be ready by the U.S. presidential election, the biotech company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief executive told the Financial Times, as MarketWatch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Mike Murphy reported. CEO St\u00c3\u00a9phane Bancel told the FT in an interview that Moderna \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a front-runner in the COVID-19 vaccine race \u00e2\u0080\u0094 will not seek emergency-use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration until Nov. 25 at the earliest and does not expect to have secured approval for distribution of the vaccine to the general public until spring 2021. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think a late [first quarter], early [second quarter] approval is a reasonable timeline, based on what we know from our vaccine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bancel told the FT. Pfizer Inc. PFE, -0.27% \u00c2 CEO Albert Bourla told employees that development of its COVID-19 vaccine would move \u00e2\u0080\u009cat the speed of science\u00e2\u0080\u009d rather than due to political pressure, the Associated Press reported. The AP cited an internal letter. Pfizer and BioNTech BNTX, +1.23% \u00c2 have an experimental coronavirus vaccine that is currently in Phase 3 trials. There are three other vaccine candidates in late-stage trials in the U.S., and Trump has repeatedly said that a vaccine may be ready by November, referring at least twice to Election Day, Nov. 3, as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cspecial date\u00e2\u0080\u009d by which time a vaccine could be available. LabCorp. LH, +0.77% \u00c2 has been granted an emergency-use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for a new type of molecular test for COVID-19. The new test uses heat and technology to extract RNA from samples collected for COVID-19 testing and can improve the efficiency of testing, the company said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe innovative heat extraction process, which has comparable sensitivity to current extraction methods, traps viral particles, eliminating the need for RNA extraction reagents to capture and concentrate viral nucleic acid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the statement. An emergency-use authorization is not a full FDA approval. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the economy saying? The U.S. created 661,000 new jobs in September and the unemployment rate fell again to 7.9% to the lowest level of the pandemic, but the gain in hiring was the smallest since the economy reopened and pointed to deceleration in the recovery, MarketWatch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Jeffry Bartash reported. The increase in employment last month fell short of Wall Street\u00e2\u0080\u0099s estimate. Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast a recapturing in September of some 800,000 lost jobs. Private-sector hiring was somewhat stronger, with 877,000 new jobs created, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday. What dragged down employment in September was a decline in public-educations jobs at local schools and state colleges. Most have adopted forms of online learning. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, fell for the fifth month in row to 7.9% from 8.4%, a new pandemic low. The official jobless rate had peaked at 14.7% in April before its ongoing decline. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis underscores that job gains from here on will be tougher, and speaks to the need for more stimulus to help the economy and to support the more than 11 million Americans who had jobs in February and who are unemployed now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. See also: Frontline workers in eye of pandemic storm for months, now fending off repo man Separately, Americans grew more optimistic toward the end of September as consumer sentiment reached a six-month high, reflecting more confidence in the U.S. economy after a summer lull. The final consumer-sentiment survey in September climbed to 80.4 from a preliminary reading of 78.9, the University of Michigan said Friday. It was also up from August\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 74.1 score. The index now sits at the highest level since the pandemic erupted in March, mirroring the results of other household surveys. Earlier this week the Conference Board said its consumer-confidence index shot up to a pandemic-period high.What are companies saying? \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Activision Blizzard Inc. ATVI, +0.52% \u00c2 is delaying the release of its \u00e2\u0080\u009cWorld of Warcraft: Shadowlands\u00e2\u0080\u009d installments to continue beta testing the game. The company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Blizzard division had expected to release the update to the massive multiplayer online role-playing game at the end of October but is opting to release it \u00e2\u0080\u009clater this year.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cBlizzard is extending the beta test and iterating based on great input from players, focusing on endgame-related tuning and polishing efforts that have been partially slowed due to the team working from home during the ongoing pandemic,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the company said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 General Motors Co.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s GM, -0.15% \u00c2 third-quarter total automobile sales fell 10%, but the company said there were \u00e2\u0080\u009csigns of recovery\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the auto industry and highlighted its September sales. GM delivered 665,192 vehicles in the quarter, a 10% drop compared with the year-ago period, but sales improved each month within the three-month span during the pandemic. The industry and GM sales \u00e2\u0080\u009crebounded significantly in September, finishing the month with year-over-year sales increases,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the company said. Retail sales also were a reason for optimism and GM said its pickup trucks and SUVs \u00e2\u0080\u009care selling extremely fast.\u00e2\u0080\u009d GM \u00e2\u0080\u009cremains focused on producing the right mix of vehicles to meet demand. Large pickup and full-size SUV plants are all operating on three shifts and at maximum overtime,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it said. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Marathon Oil Corp. MRO, -2.74% \u00c2 is reinstating its dividend despite the pressures created by the pandemic and slumping oil price. The company took recent debt-reduction measures aiming for a \u00e2\u0080\u009ctransparent framework for future capital allocation and uses of free cash flow intended to maximize long-term shareholder value.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The dividend returned at 3 cents a share, payable on Dec. 10 to stockholders of record on Nov. 18. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMarathon Oil continues to maintain a solid balance sheet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the company said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile 2020 has included its fair share of challenges, we believe we have successfully repositioned our company for success in a lower, more volatile commodity price environment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Chief Executive Lee Tillman said in a statement."}]}
