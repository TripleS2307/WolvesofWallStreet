How could that be done? \u00e2\u0080\u009cAn actual cut of the rate (currently 20%) would require the support of Congress, although an executive order allowing the indexing of capital gains to inflation might be a realizable objective,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, in a note. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow has long been an advocate for the indexing of capital gains. That approach would have the Internal Revenue Service redefine capital gains to include only returns from the sale of assets in excess of inflation, according to a 2018 analysis from the left-leaning Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. The center\u00e2\u0080\u0099s co-founder, Len Burman, argued that there are \u00e2\u0080\u009ca host of problems with applying inflation indexing only to capital gains,\u00e2\u0080\u009d including that it could be very complex, create opportunities for tax sheltering, add to the national debt and represent \u00e2\u0080\u009can extremely regressive tax cut.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cPast proposals to index capital gains for inflation would multiply the basis (or cost) of capital assets by a factor that represents the increase in the overall price level since purchase,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Burman wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCapital gain would be defined as the difference between the sale price and the indexed basis. This exercise quickly gets complex with additions to basis through, for example, reinvested dividends or new investments in a business.\u00e2\u0080\u009d CNBC host Jim Cramer was among those criticizing the possible cut late Monday, tweeting that \u00e2\u0080\u009cit may be the time for rancor if we go for a capital-gains tax cut,\u00e2\u0080\u009d because the rich \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo not need help,\u00e2\u0080\u009d while the unemployed and small-business owners do need relief during the coronavirus crisis. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are looking very seriously at a capital-gains tax cut, and also an income tax cut for middle-income families,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said at Monday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s news conference, claiming that a reduced taxation of capital gains would \u00e2\u0080\u009ccreate a lot more jobs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are looking at expanding the cuts that we have already done, but specifically for middle -income families, and you will be hearing about that in the upcoming few weeks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the president added. Related:Trump says his executive actions led to stock market\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gain, as briefing gets interrupted by shooting Top Trump administration officials on Wednesday suggested Trump wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t rely on an executive order that would require the Treasury Department to index capital gains for inflation. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s after the president used an executive order and memorandums on Saturday after negotiations broke down over the next stage of legislated coronavirus relief. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe president would like to do capital-gains tax cuts, and we do need legislation to do what we want on that front,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a Fox Business Network interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI stand with the secretary on that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kudlow said later Wednesday, when asked about Mnuchin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to take it back to 15%, where it was for quite a long time because it helps jobs, investment, productivity and wages \u00e2\u0080\u0094 plus-plus. But not through executive order,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kudlow told reporters. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe structural changes to tax rates \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not a lawyer, but I will say I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been in this game a long time \u00e2\u0080\u0094 likely require congressional legislation. I get that. So the president is looking at middle-class tax-rate reductions at the margin \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s incentive-minded tax policy, growth. The same for capital gains.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% \u00c2 and Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% on Tuesday gave up their morning gains to finish with losses, but they were trading higher on Wednesday."}]}
