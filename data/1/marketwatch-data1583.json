The news sent AstraZeneca shares AZN, +1.16% AZN, +0.63% lower, while the stocks of other drug makers developing vaccines, including Pfizer Inc., BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc. MRNA, +0.09% rallied. In an emailed statement, AstraZeneca said: \u201cAs part of the ongoing randomized, controlled global trials of the Oxford coronavirus vaccine, our standard review process was triggered and we voluntarily paused vaccination to allow review of safety data by an independent committee.\u201d It added that it is working to expedite the review of the single event to minimize any potential impact on the trial timeline. \u201cWe are committed to the safety of our participants and the highest standards of conduct in our trials.\u201d See:Vaccinating children against the flu is \u2018more important than ever\u2019 this year: pediatricians A report in the New York Times said that the volunteer in the U.K. trial received a diagnosis of transverse myelitis, an inflammatory syndrome that affects the spinal cord. \u201cHowever, the timing of this diagnosis, and whether it was directly linked to AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine, is still unknown,\u201d the NY Times said. The British drugmaker declined to the comment. The Financial Times later reported that the trial may resume as early as next week, citing people familiar with the matter.

The unusual pledge comes amid concerns the Trump administration may try to rush out a vaccine before the November presidential election. Don\u2019t miss: There are seven coronavirus vaccine candidates being tested in the U.S. \u2014 here\u2019s where they stand The World Health Organization reiterated Wednesday that safety has to come first with vaccine development. Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist at the WHO, said at a news briefing that regardless of the speed with which drug makers are working, \u201cit doesn\u2019t mean that we start compromising or cutting corners on what would normally be assessed.\u201d Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases and a member of the White House Task Force created to manage the pandemic, agreed. In an interview with CBS, Fauci said it\u2019s routine for a late-stage trial of a vaccine to be put on hold because of side effects, describing it as a safety valve, as the AP reported. Fauci said a safe and effective coronavirus vaccine may be ready in early 2021. \u201cThe more likely scenario is that we will know by the end of this calendar year and hopefully we\u2019ll be able to start vaccinations in earnest as we begin early 2021,\u201d he said.
