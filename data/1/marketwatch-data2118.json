Gates shared this photo of Buffett and his first wife and kids from the mid-1950s, which was around the time the Buffett Partnership was launched. \"For as long as I've known Warren, his approach to life and work has stayed constant,\" Gates wrote in the blog post. \"It's amazing, in fact, how little he has changed even as Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A, +0.06% has become wildly successful.\" The most important thing Gates said he learned from him is the value of friendship, and he pointed to one quote in particular that Buffett once told a group of college students. \"You will move in the direction of the people that you associate with. So it's important to associate with people that are better than yourself. The friends you have will form you as you go through life,\" Buffett said. \"Make some good friends, keep them for the rest of your life, but have them be people that you admire as well as like.\""}]}
