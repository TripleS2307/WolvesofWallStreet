And you would be right. A psychologist and gerontologist, Ken Dychtwald has built a career around consulting and public speaking about the implications of a maturing society. He founded Age Wave in 1986 and continues to serve as its chief executive, and he\u2019s co-author of the new book, \u201cWhat Retirees Want.\u201d Now 70, Dychtwald is applying what he\u2019s learned to his own life. For starters, he has embraced wellness with gusto. Read: Boomers are doing retirement their own way \u201cI\u2019m mostly on a plant-based diet, a Pritikin/Ornish diet,\u201d he says. \u201cLittle sugar. Little caffeine.\u201d A longtime yoga practitioner, he also swims daily as part of his regular exercise routine. Despite all his efforts, however, he says he\u2019s still \u201ca little overweight\u201d with high blood pressure. \u201cI take my health very seriously,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there are no guarantees. Look what happened to Jim Fixx,\u201d an avid runner who died at 52 of a heart attack. As Dychtwald ages, he\u2019s spending more time pondering his character. Inspired by journalist David Brooks\u2019s \u201ceulogy virtues,\u201d the qualities that others would praise at your funeral, he has reflected on his attitudes and behaviors and sought to improve as a person. \u201cFrom Brooks I learned that if you don\u2019t like what people would say at your funeral, course-correct,\u201d Dychtwald said. In 2009, for example, he was struck when he asked Huston Smith, then a 90-year-old religious scholar, to share a core lesson of his life. \u201cSmith said \u2018be a little kinder,\u2019\u201d Dychtwald recalled. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know me well enough to direct that at me. But I\u2019m self-indulgent, a go-getter who may be tough on people. Kindness was probably not one of my top qualities.\u201d Dychtwald says he has tried to act with more kindness and authenticity, especially with friends and family. \u201cRelationships are the nectar that give life its joys and connection,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve made it a priority to hold very dear my close relationships.\u201d Speaking of relationships, Dychtwald cites his 37-year marriage as a source of sustenance and ongoing fulfillment. Long-established rituals bring comfort as well as adventure to the couple. He hails the power of making and sticking to commitments as a way to inject freshness and discovery into life. Every year, for instance, he and his wife participate in marriage ceremonies in different places that follow different belief systems. \u201cWe\u2019ve celebrated by doing Baptist in the Caribbean and Hopi in Sedona, Arizona,\u201d he said. \u201cOne year when we didn\u2019t have much money, we went to [Las] Vegas at [A] Chapel of Love, where we got remarried for $175.\u201d Another key to successful aging involves finding ways to stay young. Seniors who are open to learning can expand their horizons, but that means resisting the temptation to reject new technology or trends. Dychtwald praises entrepreneur Chip Conley\u2019s concept of \u201cmenterns,\u201d a mash-up of mentors and interns. Sharing wisdom across generations\u2014with young people educating their elders and vice versa\u2014enriches everyone. \u201cI see a lot of retirees complain that society pushes them to the margins,\u201d Dychtwald said. \u201cBut I see that they push themselves to the margins. They don\u2019t try to understand the world from the point of view of a younger person.\u201d Practicing what he preaches, Dychtwald spent six months doing a deep dive into TikTok, the video-sharing service that started in China and gained global popularity. He\u2019s fascinated that \u201cmillions of people watch other people film themselves dancing or miming in these short videos, figuring out the lighting and [downloading] the next day.\u201d He urges older people to focus less on trying to retain their youthfulness and more on expanding their usefulness. \u201cPeople say, \u2018I\u2019d like to be like her. She\u2019s so youthful,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cYouthful is good. But I\u2019d rather be useful. And to be useful, you have to be relevant to a 15-year-old and a 40-year-old. You have to meet people halfway.\u201d"}]}
