Monday night, Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro said the U.S.-China trade deal was \"over,\" but shortly afterwards said his comments were taken out of context. President Donald Trump also followed up by saying the deal was \"fully intact.\" Speaking during a conference sponsored by Bloomberg, Mnuchin added the U.S. and other nations are seeking more transparency from China over the coronavirus, and also said he's expecting a new round of coronavirus stimulus to pass Congress in July. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% was up more than 200 points as Mnuchin spoke Tuesday, following a round of late-night volatility after the Navarro comments."}]}
