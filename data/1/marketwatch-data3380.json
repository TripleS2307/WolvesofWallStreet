Bike riders too. And she\u2019s seeing an opportunity like she\u2019s never seen before. \u201cA once-in-a-generation chance to reimagine our streets and what\u2019s actually possible,\u201d Janette Sadik-Khan said. As city transportation commissioner for six years under Mayor Mike Bloomberg, Sadik-Khan rerouted more traffic, cleared more bike paths, laid more bus lanes and reorganized more public plazas than anyone in the history of American urban life. She created what became Citi Bike and fundamentally shifted the human and vehicular flow through Times Square and Herald Square. There will be a New York City when this pandemic is finally over. What? You thought a global health crisis would stop her from insisting on more? \u201cWhen we used to take a parking spot or two,\u201d she recalled, \u201cit was like we were taking someone\u2019s firstborn child. Now, almost overnight, there are 9,100 outdoor-dining permits in New York City\u201d \u2014 tables, chairs, umbrellas and diners, many of them where cars once parked. \u201cIt\u2019s not quite Italy. But when you ride your bike or walk around, it\u2019s so exciting to see that new life. People don\u2019t want to come back to a city that\u2019s worse than when they left it.\u201d Sadik-Khan talks about streets the way real-estate developers talk about prime parcels, as raw canvases just begging for alternate use, which almost always means loosening the monopoly that cars have held. And now\u2019s the time to act, Sadik-Khan said, before all the traffic comes back to choke us and never lets go. \u201cOur cities are not going to recover if we add a traffic crisis to the ongoing health crisis and economic crisis,\u201d she said, as the national COVID-19 death count closed in on 150,000. When Sadik-Khan left City Hall, she wrote a book called \u201cStreetfight: Handbook for an Urban Revolution,\u201d co-authored with her Bloomberg Administration colleague Seth Solomonow. Now, they work together at Bloomberg Associates, the ex-mayor\u2019s consulting firm, advising officials in cities around the world on their transportation needs.

There\u2019s just not enough city for everyone to drive. That\u2019s not an economically sustainable or climate-sustainable future. You can\u2019t engineer your way out of traffic congestion. You\u2019re just renegotiating the terms of your surrender.\u201d You have to think differently, she said. \u201cAnd streets are the most valuable assets that cities have. So how else can we use them?\u201d The options, she said, include more pedestrian-only thoroughfares, more protected bike lanes, more dedicated bus routes and a whole lot more urban acreage turned into plazas and parks. Most of these moves aren\u2019t even all that expensive. They just require saying no to some cars. \u201cNo, you can\u2019t park here. Can\u2019t you see I\u2019m having dinner?\u201d \u201cNo, you can\u2019t drive so fast. You\u2019ll kill someone.\u201d Pedestrians walk along a street closed to vehicle traffic in May as the city expanded areas for safe distancing. Getty Images Most of the Bloomberg-era transportation reforms have been maintained since Bill de Blasio became mayor, though further expansion has slowed to a crawl. The current mayor did launch Vision Zero, a citywide traffic-safety initiative. But a long-discussed congestion-pricing plan is now stalled indefinitely, and prior to the pandemic, getting around the city was less of a signature issue at City Hall. But what about now? Given the current infection concerns, it could be a while before bus and subway ridership returns to normal. But that doesn\u2019t mean New Yorkers have to hide in their cars or cower at home. \u201cPeople can walk and socially distance at the same time,\u201d she said. Outside is built for that. Don\u2019t miss: Florida man uses coronavirus aid money to buy a $318,000 Lamborghini A big part of all this, according to Sadik-Khan, is not dismissing fresh possibilities because they\u2019ve never been achieved before. In fact, many of them have \u2014 just not in America. \u201cLook at what\u2019s happening right now in London or Paris or Mexico City or Milan,\u201d she said. \u201cThe streets are the first places to reopen. People are really hungry to come back to normal, a new normal at least. And that means being outside.\u201d \u201cThere is so much more we can do to repurpose the 6,000 miles of streets in New York City to make them work better, even if it takes a long time before people feel safe getting around the way they used to,\u201d she said. \u201cCities have recovered from all kinds of adversity. London after World War II, New York City after 9/11. Cities come back better than ever. People are still scared now, but cities have always been more resilient than a lot of people expect.\u201d The coronavirus is just the latest challenge. \u201cThe real issue is not bringing cities back,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s learning a new language of the possible and being resilient enough to deal with the next crisis when it comes.\u201d Ellis Henican is an author based in New York City and a former newspaper columnist."}]}
