COST, +1.19% said Wednesday its June sales rose 11% to $16.2 billion, from $14.6 billion in June 2019. Same-store sales rose 12%, including an 11% increase in U.S. same-store sales. E-commerce sales increased 86%, the company said. Costco sales in May rose 7.5% and online sales jumped 106% that month. Costco has reported strong e-commerce sales this year but at its last quarterly report in April the company said the online sales hadn't made up for the drop in foot traffic at the stores and other businesses such as optical, food court, and travel due to the stay-at-home orders, social-distancing restrictions and closures related to the coronavirus pandemic. Costco is slated to report fiscal fourth-quarter results sometime in September, with quarterly sales seen around $50 billion, according to FactSet. Shares of Costco rose nearly 1% in the extended session after ending the regular trading day up less than 0.1%."}]}
