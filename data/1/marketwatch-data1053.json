How do grandparents get their names?", "body": "This article is reprinted by permission from NextAvenue.org. Bigi. Gigi. Babcia (pronounced bahp-cha). Dziadziu (pronounced JAH-Joo). Donk. Meema. Popeye (a boat was involved). Welcome to the interesting world of naming grandparents. Susan OHara has eight grandchildren; the two eldest chose her name. \u201cThey call me Mom Mom Cherry because when my two oldest granddaughters were little and I would visit, they would always go into my purse and put on my lipstick which was cherry flavored, and that\u2019s how they knew me from the other grandmoms,\u201d explained OHara of Millsboro, Del. When it comes to grandparent names, you don\u2019t always have a choice, as Lord Grantham of PBS\u2019 \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d realized. His granddaughter, Sibbie, addressed him as Donk. The nickname was a reference to a donkey, as in Pin the Tail on the Donkey. Your moniker in the world of tiny toes and wide-eyed smiles is not always dignified, accurate or expected. Grandparent names can originate from mispronunciations, locations, the need for differentiation, traditions, ethnic backgrounds, creative responses to family conflicts and a multitude of other reasons.

Hammonds said, \u201cOnce my grandson started talking, I officially became NJ, no matter where I eventually moved!\u201d When the boy told one of his first grade classmates, they thought he said his grandmother was a Ninja. Linda Huhn\u2019s five grandchildren are lucky to have a grandmother living in a coastal area; she previously lived inland in Elsmere, Del. \u201cBecause they have several grandparents, I told them to call me MomMom Linda,\u201d Huhn said. But her granddaughter dubbed her Beach MomMom. Kids make connections, and suddenly that\u2019s your name. \u201cI\u2019m known to eight grandkids as Grandma Duck,\u201d said Kathie Meredith. \u201cOur home was full of decoys, mallard and mandarin carvings, Audubon art \u2014 generally a tidewater theme,\u201d she said of her home in Harford County, Md. where the kids enjoyed fishing off their pier on the Gunpowder River. \u201cWhen our first grandkid could talk and came to visit, he smiled through the screen door and said, \u2018Duck!\u2019 I loved it. From then on, there was no mistaking which grandma they were going to visit,\u201d said Meredith.

It\u2019s all about making the name an easy fit for little lips. \u201cI am Grammy Pammy,\u201d said Pamela Okolowicz. \u201cMy daughter started it with the kids because it rhymed with my name.\u201d With their daughter in Virginia and their son in Pennsylvania, Okolowicz and her husband moved to southern Delaware to be equidistant to both families. \u201cWe now have Camp Grammy Pammy every summer,\u201d Okolowicz said. DeeDee Hoover of Sussex County, Del., became Deena, a combination of her given name and Nana. \u201cWe moved from South Carolina to be close to these wonderful grandchildren,\u201d she said. Some grandparents stack the odds by choosing a name that\u2019s easy to pronounce, then coach the kiddies. \u201cI asked to be called Nana because I knew they could learn to say it way sooner than Grandma,\u201d declared Pat Nucatola, a native New Yorker. \u201cI would hold the baby to my face and say, \u2018OK, let\u2019s practice: nananana\u2026!\u2019\u201dTraditions and family dynamics If you\u2019re in the market for names that are easy on the ears, I\u2019m hearing lots of grandmothers answering to Mimi and Gigi and grandfathers responding to Poppy and PopPop. Mary Beth Jones went traditional, with a twist. \u201cI called both my grandmothers Nana and my mother was a Nana,\u201d said Jones, who is known to her six grandchildren \u2014 and four great grandchildren\u2013 as Nana MB. Heritage often plays a role in grandparent naming. \u201cI am Oma,\u201d said Kathleen Carroll of Millsboro, Del. \u201cIt means grandma in German, and I am part German. My husband is plain ol\u2019 Poppop. He didn\u2019t want to be called Umpa, can\u2019t understand why!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m called Babcia,\u201d (pronounced bahp-cha) said Sharon Bezak. \u201cOur daughter wanted to carry on with some Polish.\u201d But Bezak\u2019s husband is simply Grandpa. Since grandparents tend to come in pairs, some approach naming as a couple. Gramms partners perfectly with Gramps. Patti Miller and her husband of Sussex County, Del., chose Gooma and Goopa, and all five granddaughters approve. When step-grandparents are part of the family dynamics (and un-pairing and re-pairing having occurred) it\u2019s a mixed bag of names and relationships. Barbara Sarubbi of Lewes, Del., went with an easy adaptation. \u201cI chose Gee Ma since I am a step-grandmother and did not want to offend Grandma 1 and Grandma 2,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are Lolly and Pop,\u201d said Stacy Aaronson. \u201cMy stepdaughter let everyone choose.\u201d Due to divorce on both sides, there are four grandmothers and three grandfathers: Grammy and Pappy; Nanny K; G-Ma and G-Pa. \u201cOf course, as they begin to talk, it will be however the kids can pronounce it,\u201d said Aaronson, formerly of Phoenixville, Pa., where the children and grandchildren still live.Cherished, but not always chosen Differentiating is important, whatever the reason. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want any repeats,\u201d explained Cindy Summers, who raised her children in Fairfax, Va. and goes by Nanie. \u201cWe discussed and chose it because all the normal grandmother names were already taken in the family.\u201d Coming up with creative names for everyone can be complicated. \u201cI\u2019m called Grandmom by my four grandchildren and that differentiates me from the other grandparents who are Mommom, Poppop and Googa,\u201d said Janet Chubrick of Long Neck, Del. \u201cWhen our first grandson started to talk, he would get confused between Grandma and Grandpa and would call us Mawpaw.\u201d Names are cherished, but not always chosen. Inevitably, there are names left unspoken. Perhaps they were deemed inappropriate by the parents, criticized by the other grandparents or too difficult for the grandkids to grasp. Karen Tighe\u2019s name game began when she was only 43, in North Plainfield, N.J. \u201cI was struggling with being called Grandma,\u201d she said. Her daughter, trying to help, started calling her The Lady. However when Tighe\u2019s grandson started to speak, she didn\u2019t think The Lady was appropriate and suggested Grandma Lady. \u201cBut since he called me lady for such a long time, lady came out first, so I\u2019m known as Lady Grandma by all four of my grandchildren,\u201d said Tighe. Read next: COVID-19 has dashed the retirement dreams of these people Tighe\u2019s search didn\u2019t end there. When her last two grandchildren, Athena and Zoe, were born, their other grandma, who is Greek, was referred to as Yaya. \u201cSo I said to them, \u2018You can call me Lady Yaya.\u2019 But it didn\u2019t stick,\u201d said Tighe.
