Half of U.S. states are now reporting rising coronavirus infections. And Joe Biden is beating President Trump in election polls, with the potential for Democrats taking both chambers of Congress. But even if the Democrats once again transform the U.S. health-care system, companies that develop new treatments and improved medical technology will continue to be rewarded. Ashtyn Evans, a senior health-care analyst at Edward Jones, named six players she expects to perform well over the next three to five years. With that longer-term focus, Edward Jones doesn't set price targets for buy-rated stocks. \"A Democratic sweep can be a big risk for health care. But if you think about where we can position for the long term, the companies that focus on innovation and not just on cost-cutting and M&A [mergers and acquisitions], are where we would point investors to,\" she said in an interview. Evans said Biden \"is not advocating a single-payer system,\" meaning fully socialized medicine, which would be \"the biggest risk\" to the health-care sector's companies and profits. A Biden victory probably pushes that threat back at least four years. But there may be \"other pressures on the edge of big pharma, including pricing pressure,\" she said. Ashtyn Evans, a senior analyst at Edward Jones. Edward Jones She recommends investors focus on innovation in medical products and services, as well as companies with geographically diverse businesses. Here are the six stocks Evans named as \"buys,\" followed by her comments about each company.
