Monday\u2019s gains also stretched the shares\u2019 winning streak to a third session. The stock has gained 72% this year, compared with gains of around 4% for the S&P 500 index. SPX, +0.87% All seven analysts surveyed by FactSet rate it a buy, with an average price target of $25.43, representing an upside around 27%. Virgin Galactic \u201chas a unique business with leading market position (no operating competition) and an experienced management team,\u201d B. of A. analyst Ronald Epstein said in a note Monday. He also highlighted Virgin Galactic\u2019s vertical integration capabilities, calling them \u201cunparalleled.\u201d Most of its rocket and spaceship components, from carbon-fiber structures to avionics and flight simulators, are done in house.

As of today, Virgin Galactic has only flown the full mission (to space) two times,\u201d Epstein said.

In June, it inked a deal with NASA to train and outfit future space travelers in a bid to boost space tourism. Its closest competitors are privately held Blue Origin, founded by Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s AMZN, +3.01% Jeff Bezos, and SpaceX, founded and led by Tesla Inc.\u2019s TSLA, +1.89% Elon Musk. Analyst Charles Minervino at Susquehanna Financial also started covering the stock at the equivalent of a buy rating, with a $20 price target. \u201cWe see (Virgin Galactic) as an innovator of space technology with a truly unique offering that will allow civilians and professionals alike to access space for entertainment and research purposes,\" he said in a note. The company is set to tap into \u201csignificant latent demand for space tourism,\u201d he said. It is still in early stages, and Minervino said he doesn\u2019t expect \u201dpositive EBITDA or free cash flow until 2023 and 2024, respectively, which certainly serves as a fundamental risk.\u201d The company\u2019s \u201cfuture business opportunities can spread considerably wider than what is seen at the moment \u2013 ranging from public leisure and professional space travel to government contracting and future highspeed commercial travel,\u201d he said."}]}
