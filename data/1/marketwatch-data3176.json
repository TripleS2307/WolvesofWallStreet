His Democratic rival, Joe Biden, delivers about half that many posts to an audience of just 2 million. The numbers are similarly skewed in other spheres of the social media landscape. On Twitter TWTR, -0.23% , Trump\u2019s 82.4 million followers dwarf Biden\u2019s 6.4 million. The president has spent years cultivating a ragtag digital \u201carmy\u201d of meme makers and political influencers who retweet campaign messages hundreds of times daily. Trump is outspending Biden on Google GOOG, +1.97% and YouTube advertising by nearly 3 to 1. As his reelection bid faces growing obstacles, his primacy in the dizzying digital world is one of his top advantages, giving him a massive platform to connect with supporters and push a message that ignores his vulnerabilities related to the pandemic, unemployment and race relations. Biden and his allies are now working feverishly to establish a social media force of their own. For the first time, Biden outspent Trump on Facebook FB, +0.26% advertising in June, pouring twice as much money into the platform as the president. His campaign is recruiting Instagram supporters to hold virtual fundraisers. And it\u2019s plotting ways to mobilize the power of hundreds of teens on TikTok who reserved tickets for Trump\u2019s recent Oklahoma campaign rally and took credit for sinking the event by artificially inflating the crowd count before it began. But Trump\u2019s head start may be tough to overcome. \u201cVice President Biden and Trump have very different challenges right now,\u201d said Tara McGowan, the founder of liberal digital firm Acronym and former digital director for the Democratic super PAC Priorities USA during the 2016 campaign. \u201cTrump needs to hold his base ... and Vice President Biden needs to define and in a lot of ways introduce himself to you new voters, and potential supporters.\u201d But Trump\u2019s unimpeded access to the digital microphone is facing its limits. Twitter is beginning to fact check Trump\u2019s posts, including one that made unfounded claims that mail-in voting would lead to fraud. The company also alerted users when the president posted a manipulated video, and it hid his Twitter threat about shooting looters in Minneapolis. Under pressure in June as major companies yanked advertising from its site, Facebook promised it would label Trump posts when they break rules around voting or hate speech. Video messaging platform Snapchat SNAP, -0.18% last month also said it would keep the president\u2019s account active and searchable but would stop showcasing his profile on the platform. And in a move to clamp down on hate and violent speech, the online comment forum Reddit decided to ban one of the president\u2019s most prolific fan forums, The_Donald. Trump and Biden have strikingly divergent tactics on social media. A centerpiece of Trump\u2019s digital efforts is the Team Trump Online! nightly live broadcasts streamed on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Twitch, an online streaming platform. The broadcasts feature top Trump surrogates including daughter-in-law Lara Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. Trump also tweets with far greater velocity, sending more than 160 Twitter messages during a seven-day period starting June 14, an Associated Press analysis of Trump and Biden\u2019s accounts reveals. More than 50 of Trump\u2019s posts were retweets from an assortment of users that included the U.S. Army, far-right meme makers, conservative news outlets, little-known congressional candidates and anonymous accounts that in some cases promoted conspiracy theories. The president\u2019s steady retweets of everyday users helps fans feel connected to him, said Logan Cook, a Kansas internet meme maker whose work Trump has regularly promoted on his social media accounts. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s team, they\u2019re blending in with social media culture, which is also why they\u2019re getting into so much trouble,\u201d said Cook, whose Twitter account @CarpeDonktum was permanently suspended last week for copyright violations. His memes are controversial because he alters videos to mock Trump\u2019s political rivals, including Biden. Twitter users celebrate being retweeted by the president, or his inner circle, like the president\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr., who has more than 5 million followers. Trump\u2019s followers see producing sardonic memes or videos as a game where the ultimate prize is a retweet from the president, said Misha Leybovich, a tech entrepreneur who produces social media engagement products that support Democratic candidates and causes. \u201cThe fan base is having a blast,\u201d Leybovich said. \u201cIf they never gave the fans the ability to be amplified by the president, the stakes would be lower.\u201d Biden has stuck to a more conventional approach, tweeting nearly 60 messages during that same time, only a handful of which were retweets from verified accounts, like former President Barack Obama, or established news outlets. Every video Biden tweeted out over that week in June was produced by his own campaign. But the effectiveness of campaign messaging isn\u2019t just about numbers, said Jennifer Mercieca, a political rhetoric professor at Texas A&M University. \u201cIf you want to compare the attention and engagement metrics, it might look like Trump is way ahead, but that attention and outrage isn\u2019t always good,\u201d Mercieca said. \u201cWhen a child is throwing a tantrum, you\u2019re giving them attention, but it\u2019s not because you approve of their behavior.\u201d Indeed, the Biden campaign argues that despite being outmatched on social media, their engagement is strong. \u201cThe way that they treat their supporters, it\u2019s about distraction. It\u2019s about keeping them angry,\u201d said Rob Friedlander, Biden campaign digital director. \u201cFor us it\u2019s about, how do we make you feel like you\u2019re brought into the campaign.\u201d The campaign is creating Facebook groups, holding virtual events on Instagram and partnering with social media influencers who create posts in support of the campaign. One such group is an Instagram account called Bakers for Biden,which bakes bread and ships sourdough starters across the country in exchange for donations to Biden. The group was born out of what Brooklyn marketing executive Domenic Venuto first saw as an inadequate response from Biden\u2019s campaign to Trump\u2019s taunts and conspiracy theories. Venuto said he\u2019s come to understand the campaign\u2019s digital strategy of ignoring Trump\u2019s attacks. \u201cThey\u2019ve been very good at promoting values and shying away from being baited into the same tactics (as the Trump campaign),\u201d Venuto said."}]}
