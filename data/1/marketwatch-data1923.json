The virus that has sickened more than 2.3 million Americans has also attracted bad actors seeking to profit from the worst public health crisis since 1918\u2019s deadly flu outbreak. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen in other periods of crisis that people try to take advantage,\u201d Steven Peikin, co-director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement, told MarketWatch in an interview. \u201cWe saw it with SARS, with Ebola, with Hurricane Katrina and after 9/11. A lot of individuals want to take advantage of investor concern and interest, and we\u2019ve seen that in spades in connection with this crisis.\u201d The proliferation of news releases and social-media postings from individuals and companies claiming to have cures, home testing kits or products that guarantee immunity, has already led the agency to temporarily halt trading in the shares of more than 30 companies in an effort to protect investors. \u201c \u2018We\u2019ve seen in other periods of crisis that people try to take advantage. We saw it with SARS, with Ebola, with Hurricane Katrina and after 9/11.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Stephen Peikin, SEC Division of Enforcement In May, the SEC filed charges against Florida-based Praxsyn Corp. PXYN, +100.00% and its chief executive for falsely claiming they were negotiating the sale of millions of N95 masks. Those masks are much in demand among health-care workers and people at high risk, as they can prevent the virus\u2019s spread via the droplets that are released when people cough or speak. That same month, the agency filed a complaint against Applied Biosciences Corp. APPB, in federal court for the Southern District of New York over a press release published on March 31 that said it had started offering and shipping supposed finger-prick COVID-19 tests to the general public. The tests could be used for \u201chomes, schools, hospitals, law enforcement, military, public servants or anyone wanting immediate and private results,\u201d said the release, and could produce results in under 15 minutes. The complaint alleged that the tests were not intended for home use and could be used only with the help of medical professionals. It further alleged that the company had not shipped any such tests as of March 31. For more, see: SEC files charges against 2 more companies for false claims about COVID-19 The problem is so widespread that the SEC created a coronavirus steering committee in March led by Peikin and his fellow co-director of enforcement, Stephanie Avakian. The committee is tasked with proactively identifying fraud and coordinating the SEC\u2019s response to ensure it\u2019s consistent across the agency\u2019s operations of more than 1,400 people in 12 offices. \u201cSteering committees are rare,\u201d said Avakian. \u201cBut it\u2019s not just about the pandemic. It was clear by mid-March that we were not just in the midst of a health crisis but also dealing with markets that were highly disrupted and volatile, and for both pieces we have historical precedent to look to.\u201d When the stock market was experiencing wild swings, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% moving by thousands of points in a single day at the peak of the turbulence in March and repeatedly triggering circuit breakers, the agency could look back at things that happened during the 2008 financial crisis. Redemption requests, for example, can be a red flag, if investors are unable to get money out of investments. That was how one famous swindler, Bernie Madoff, was uncovered during the 2008\u201309 financial crisis. Madoff\u2019s massive Ponzi scheme came to light when he was unable to keep up with investors seeking to withdraw their money. Don\u2019t miss:Hertz pulls potentially worthless share offering \u201cThose market-correction dynamic scenarios can reveal past misconduct,\u201d said Peikin. \u201cIt also creates opportunities for people to engage in mischief.\u201d Some of that mischief likely comes from players drawn out by the recent surge in interest in stocks from less experienced investors. Brian Reynolds, chief market strategist at Reynolds Strategy LLC, said market data over the past couple months have revealed that investor flows are \u201cdisproportionately\u201d coming from retail investors. \u201c[R]etail investors ... are pushing up the price of stocks that are under-owned by institutions and also getting involved in insane schemes,\u201d Reynolds wrote in a recent note to clients. \u201cThis behavior cannot go on forever, but it can go on for a while.\u201d See: Investing legend Burton Malkiel on day-trading millennials, the end of the 60/40 portfolio and more So how does the SEC manage to track all of the false information that could lead investors to lose money? \u201cWe take a holistic approach and look at all kinds of sources, starting with news,\u201d said Peikin. The agency monitors trading activity, particularly in securities that are volatile, and tracks whether stock moves appear to be driven by news or are unexplained and look suspicious. The agency relies heavily on referrals from FINRA, the self-regulator for the brokerage industry. It also hears from the Justice Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigations and from the investing public. See:FTC warns company to stop claiming that listening to certain musical frequencies will \u2018weaken\u2019 the coronavirus In a typical year, the SEC receives between 17,000 and 20,000 such letters of complaint from investors, but the numbers soared by 45% in the period from March 15 to June 15, said Avakian. The regulator also gets information from short sellers, which it evaluates on a case-by-case basis. \u201cWe get a lot of information from market participants,\u201d said Avakian. \u201cWe always have to evaluate whether the information provider has an economic interest, on the long or short side, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily invalidate their claim.\u201d So how should small investors approach investing during the pandemic? As with any investment, investors should do their homework, said Avakian. Start by going to Investor.gov on the SEC\u2019s website and read the guidance on avoiding fraud. In addition to tools and calculators to help understand investing, the site offers plenty of advice on avoiding being swindled by fraudsters targeting retirement savings or even charitable-investment scams. Investors should always do their own research on any potential investment and use common sense. \u201cIf it sounds too good to be true, it probably is,\u201d she said. Why 'Frankenstein' fraud costs U.S. companies over $6 billion a year Investors should always ask questions. They should beware of unsolicited offers that come out of the blue, as that is often a red flag. Any promise that is presented as a \u201csure thing\u201d should be taken with a grain of salt. \u201cNo doubt some companies will come up with a vaccine or treatment, but we don\u2019t know which ones yet, so it\u2019s important to do your research,\u201d she said.

Still, Avakian and Peikin signaled they expect further charges will be filed, and concede that there are numerous pending investigations. A typical SEC investigation of fraud takes about two years to complete. The Praxsyn case took just 61 days. \u201cIt suggests the message has been heard by those who would engage in this conduct,\u201d said Peikin. \u201cBut we don\u2019t pretend to have them all. There\u2019s more work to be done.\u201d Read on: SEC\u2019s regulatory work could be hamstrung by leadership change with Clayton set to exit, analyst says"}]}
