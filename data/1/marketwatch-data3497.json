The Fed has signaled that it would allow inflation to overshoot its 2% target for some time. The pledge has met with some skepticism on Wall Street because the central bank has failed to hit its 2% target in recent years. Bullard said there were several factors that could push the price level higher: a more relaxed Fed, huge fiscal deficits and possible bottleneck pressures given the 30% annual growth rate expected in the June-September quarter. \"I actually think you may see more inflation than we have during the pre-pandemic era... when inflation was very subdued,\" he said."}]}
