Technology, and stocks that benefited from the work-from-home trend in recent months, recovered some ground Wednesday. \u201cBroadly, the technology sector is leading the recovery,\u201d said James Ragan, director of Wealth Management Research at D.A. Davidson, in an interview with MarketWatch, adding that early signs of a rotation into downtrodden stocks has fizzled. \u201cWe could say that today, any rotation has stalled out,\u201d he said. \u201cOver the past few months, any time we get a little more strong performance from value groups, it doesn\u2019t really last.\u201d At the same time, concerns have been mounting that valuations for top performers have gotten euphoric, leaving the market vulnerable to a near-term pullback and more volatile trade. \u201cThose gains didn\u2019t make a lot of sense,\u201d said Donald Calcagni, chief investment officer with Mercer Advisors, in an interview with MarketWatch. \u201cWhen you have Amazon trading at 120 times earnings and the economy is contracting 32%, that just doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d Calcagni spent the past several months with a healthy respect for the coronavirus. \u201cIf there are businesses, communities, states, that say, to hell with it, let\u2019s reopen, I share that emotion, but people are still getting sick,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cAnd the reality is that\u2019s going to spook consumers. If the consumer is spooked they\u2019re not going to spend. That\u2019s going to weigh on the economy.\u201d He calls himself \u201cbearish\u201d over the next few months as those economic headwinds continue and the likelihood of a contested U.S. presidential election looms in November. In pandemic news, the global death toll edged toward 900,000 and a trial for a potential COVID-19 vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca PLC AZN, +0.63% AZN, +1.16% was halted after a participant was struck by an unexplained illness.

Also Wednesday, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden rolled out his \u201cMade in America\u201d tax policy, while campaigning in Michigan, which includes a proposed new offshoring penalty and a minimum 21% corporate tax on all foreign earnings, but a 10% tax credit for any companies making investments to create U.S. jobs, such as by revitalizing existing facilities that have been closed. Economic data showed that U.S. employers posted more job openings in July but hired fewer workers than in June, the Labor Department reported, as early-summer optimism about reopening businesses faded. There were 6.6 million job openings posted, not far off the pre-pandemic average. Which companies were in focus? Shares of Tesla Inc.
