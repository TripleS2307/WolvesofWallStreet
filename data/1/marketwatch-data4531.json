Across the 19 countries that use the euro as their currency, gross domestic product fell by 12.1% in the second quarter, the European Union's statistics agency Eurostat said Friday in a first estimate for the period. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had expected a 11.3% contraction. This is the largest drop since records began in 1995, exceeding by far the quarter-to-quarter declines seen in the wake of the global financial crisis. On an annualized basis, the economy shrank by 15.0%, Eurostat said. Eurostat revised data for the first quarter of 2020. Following the revision, eurozone GDP contracted 3.6% in the period compared with a first estimate of a 3.8% decline. The eurozone's northern members suffered more modest declines in output during the second quarter compared with their southern counterparts. On Thursday, Germany reported a decline of 10.1%, while Spain's GDP fell by 18.5%, as reported on Friday. The rise in unemployment in the eurozone has so far been limited, in part thanks to government programs that pay the wages of furloughed workers. Eurostat said Thursday that the currency area's unemployment rate rose modestly in June, to 7.8% from 7.7% in May. Write to Maria Martinez at maria.martinez@wsj.com"}]}
