Well stocked but eerily still. Now that another small crack has opened in New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coronavirus shutdown and visitors are trickling back in, the Metropolitan Museum of Art is again doing the job it is here for, helping to shed fresh light on our current travails as only great art can. The two Kyles\u00e2\u0080\u0094Kyle Alderdice and Kyle Sherman, one a furloughed bookseller, the other an actor at a time of no theater, both of Harlem\u00e2\u0080\u0094were standing in the brightness of the Met\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Carroll and Milton Petrie European Sculpture Court. They were gazing somberly at \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Burghers of Calais,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Auguste Rodin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s haunting bronze depiction of another city under siege. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know the story?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the first Kyle asked the second Kyle. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite a tale and quite a relevant one. It goes back to the 14th century and the Hundred Years\u00e2\u0080\u0099 War, when Edward III claimed to be heir to the Kingdom of France. After a long and bloody assault, Edward\u00e2\u0080\u0099s army had managed to capture the northern French city of Calais. So eager was the English king to exact retribution for the citizens\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u009cobstinate defense,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he ordered they be killed en masse. The massacre was suspended only after six of Calais\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leading citizens agreed to present themselves to the angry king, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbareheaded and barefooted\u00e2\u0080\u009d with ropes around their necks, prepared to die so that others might live. Rodin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s massive sculpture depicts the forlorn men just as they are leaving for the king\u00e2\u0080\u0099s camp in 1347, carrying the keys to the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gates and citadel. Kyle Alderdice, left, shares the story of Auguste Rodin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Burghers of Calais\u00e2\u0080\u009d with his friend, Kyle Sherman. Ellis Henican/MarketWatch Desperation. Patriotism. The tragedy of horrible choices. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Burghers of Calais\u00e2\u0080\u009d evokes it all. And a city at the brink of who knows what. The Met closed abruptly on March 13, the same week that much of New York went dark. For more than a century, the museum had never been shuttered for more than three days at a time. And even now, no one can predict the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future as a world capital of commerce, culture and humanity, not until the pandemic is over and the raging virus is tamed. But we do have some potent infrastructure that will help to propel a glorious return, quite a bit of it up a large set of stairs at 1000 Fifth Ave. Just as the best art always tells a story, so do those who curate it and those who come to consume it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur message to New Yorkers is that we all endure many things living in the city,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Kenneth Weine, the museum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vice president of external affairs. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis has been a traumatic five-plus months for all of us. So, please, come enjoy this jewel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Saturday was the public reopening, preceded by two members-only days. Advance reservations are required now, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re easy to get. Masks are mandatory. Temperatures are taken at the door. And the crowds are limited to 25% capacity. What all this seems to mean in practice is that, with so few tourists in the city, people who live here suddenly have the run of the joint. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe were always confident we could offer a safe experience,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Weine said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTwo million square feet. Hundreds of galleries. A trained security staff. And filled with New Yorkers who understand the importance of masks and social distancing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It was really just a matter of Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Other notable institutions newly reopened include the Museum of Modern Art, the American Folk Art Museum and the Museum of the City of New York.

And a retrospective called Making the Met, 1870\u00e2\u0080\u00932020, celebrating 150 years of the museum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s collection. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe actual anniversary was April 13, right at the pandemic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s height,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Weine said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was here on Thursday, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m back again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Alderdice said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where I come alone whenever I need a lift.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2 But on Monday, he brought along his actor friend Kyle Sherman, who moved to the city from Missouri in 2015 and had never once set foot in the Metropolitan Museum. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ridiculous,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was even in a show that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all about the Met.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Read next: It ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t over! It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s New York! He was Warren, he said, in Adam Gwon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s musical \u00e2\u0080\u009cOrdinary Days,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the cheerful, annoying one who sees beauty in simple things. Two key scenes are inside the museum, including one under a Claude Monet painting. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even a song called \u00e2\u0080\u009cSaturday at the Met.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In the finale, Warren and his friend Deb are back at the museum, where he explains to her that ordinary things, \u00e2\u0080\u009csimple, familiar and full of feeling,\u00e2\u0080\u009d can also be art. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s when he delivers the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s musical finale, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBeautiful.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cReally, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never been here before,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sherman said after the short Rodin briefing. This week, even the story behind the sculptor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bleak \u00e2\u0080\u009cBurghers of Calais\u00e2\u0080\u009d ends on an encouraging note. Edward\u00e2\u0080\u0099s queen, Philippa of Hainault, begs him to spare the lives of the six Calaisians. Against his better judgment, he relents. Is there a message in there for COVID-19?
