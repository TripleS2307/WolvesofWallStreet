On Sunday, Adm. Brett Giroir, the testing coordinator at the Department of Health and Human Services, told NBC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cMeet the Press\u00e2\u0080\u009d that Fauci was not correct in his advice to states to slow down the opening of businesses: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI respect Dr. Fauci a lot, but Dr. Fauci is not 100% right, and he also doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily, he admits that, have the whole national interest in mind. He looks at it from a very narrow public-health point of view,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Giroir said. The same day, President Trump retweeted a tweet from April that was critical of Fauci: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo based on Dr. Fauci and the Democrats, I will need an ID card to go shopping but not to vote?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098I respect Dr. Fauci a lot, but Dr. Fauci is not 100% right.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Adm. Brett Giroir, the testing coordinator at the Department of Health and Human Services He also retweeted this tweet: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe most outrageous lies are the ones about Covid 19. Everyone is lying. The CDC, Media, Democrats, our Doctors, not all but most that we are told to trust. I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all about the election and keeping the economy from coming back, which is about the election. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sick of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Fauci told the Financial Times that he has not briefed the president since June 2. Most voters said they approved of Fauci, although the majority of Republicans said so by a whisker, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll of 1,337 registered voters from June 17 to June 22. Overall, 67% of voters said they approved of the doctor, including 81% of Democrat, 51% of Republicans and 67% of Independents. Last week, Trump also doubled down on his criticism of Fauci\u00e2\u0080\u0099s response to the pandemic. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDr. Fauci's a nice man, but he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s made a lot of mistakes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said on Sean Hannity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Fox News show. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLike you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to ban them coming in from very infected China. I did it anyway and we saved hundreds of thousands of lives. I banned Europe from coming in when Italy and France and Spain were having all the problems.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been wrong about a lot things, including face masks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaybe they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re wrong, maybe not, but a lot of them said don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wear a mask, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wear a mask. Now they are saying wear a mask. So a lot of mistakes were made \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a lot of mistakes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The president has rarely worn a mask in public and has not said Americans should wear masks. In a break with his tradition of eschewing any face covering, he wore one this past weekend while visiting Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. On April 13, when reporters questioned Fauci about possible tension between him and the administration, Fauci said he made recommendations to Trump to restrict travel. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe travel was another recommendation, when we went in and said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098We probably should be doing that,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Fauci said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the answer was yes. And then another time was, \u00e2\u0080\u0098We should do it with Europe,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and the answer was yes. And the next time, \u00e2\u0080\u0098We should do it with the U.K.,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and the answer was yes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to do it. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m choosing not to do it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 President Trump talking in April about whether or not he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d wear a face mask Trump himself has previously been circumspect on masks. On April 3, the administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reversed their policies on masks, and said everyone \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not just medical workers, as they previously said \u00e2\u0080\u0094 should wear face coverings. Trump cited \u00e2\u0080\u009crecent studies\u00e2\u0080\u009d of asymptomatic transmission for the U-turn, while the CDC cited \u00e2\u0080\u009cnew evidence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That same day, Trump said his administration recommended wearing cloth face coverings. However, he said he wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wear a mask himself. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom recent studies, we know that the transmission from individuals without symptoms is playing a more significant role in the spread of the virus than previously understood,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to do it. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m choosing not to do it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d On April 15, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued an executive order requiring New Yorkers to wear masks in public. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPut the mask on when you are not in socially distant places,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is your right to go out for a walk in the park, go out for a walk because you need to get out of the house. Fine, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t infect me. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a right to infect me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Fauci recently said that the U.S. government had not been doing well with contact tracing, the process of tracing people who have been in contact with someone identified to have the virus, instructing them to stay home, and connecting them with the resources they need to do so. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing very well, for a number of reasons, and not all of which is the fault of the system,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said in an interview last month with CNN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s T, -1.01% \u00c2 Elizabeth Cohen. COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, has already proved extremely infectious. It had infected 13.1 million people globally and more than 3.4 million in the U.S. as of Tuesday, according to official figures collated by Johns Hopkins University\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Center for Systems Science and Engineering. The disease had claimed at least 573,664 lives worldwide and 135,615 in the U.S. The White House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sharp words for Fauci came as confirmed coronavirus cases were rising in nearly 40 U.S. states. Meanwhile, New York, which was once the epicenter of the pandemic in the U.S. and still has the most cases of anywhere in the U.S. (at least 406,400 confirmed cases and 32,395 fatalities from the disease), reported zero deaths Monday for the first time since the pandemic began. New Jersey (15,560 deaths) and Massachusetts (8,330 deaths) are among the top three states with the highest number of fatalities. Florida\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Department of Health reported 15,299 people tested positive for COVID-19 on Sunday, bumping the total confirmed case tally for the Sunshine State to 269,811 cases, the Associated Press reported. The previous record was 11,694 cases in a single day, set last week by California. On Monday, Florida reported over 12,000 new cases. \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098Why is the White House trashing Dr. Fauci?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 CNN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Jim Acosta asking White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany about reports of \u00e2\u0080\u0098opposition research on Fauci In more bad news, Florida counted a record of 514 fatalities last week, compared with the average of 30 deaths a day the state was recording just three weeks ago. Testing has doubled in the past month to almost 50,000 a day from 25,000, and the percentage of people testing positive has risen to an average of 19% in the last week from less than 5% a month ago, the AP reported. To date, 4,277 people have died in Florida from COVID-19. Studies have concluded that face masks have helped reduce contagion by reducing droplets being sprayed into the air during flu season; one Japanese-based study says this works when paired with vaccination. It may be that masks work in a small number of cases and/or just wearing them helps to promote healthy behaviors. On Monday, CNN reporter Jim Acosta asked White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy is the White House trashing Dr. Fauci? The president has gone off on anonymous sources in the past. Why not have the guts to trash Dr. Fauci with your own names?\u00e2\u0080\u009d McEnany said suggestions that there was opposition research on Fauci \u00e2\u0080\u009ccouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be further from the truth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She said the White House issued statements made by Fauci in response to a reporter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enquiry. Acosta suggested the president made mistakes: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe suggested at one point that Americans inject themselves with disinfectants. That sort of thing. Why not send out these notes to reporters about what Dr. Fauci said in the past with your names on them? It was sent out by a White House official.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In response to Acosta, McEnany said the president has had an \u00e2\u0080\u009chistoric response\u00e2\u0080\u009d to the pandemic, and said Fauci himself has praised the president. (In April, Trump floated the idea of using ultraviolet light inside the human body or a disinfectant by \u00e2\u0080\u009cinjection\u00e2\u0080\u009d as a treatment for coronavirus, a suggestion doctors called \u00e2\u0080\u009cdangerous.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The next day, Trump said he was not being serious: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was asking a question sarcastically to reporters like you just to see what would happen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d) The rift between Fauci and Trump widened against a backdrop of rising cases. Last week, in an interview livestreamed on Twitter TWTR, -0.23% and Facebook FB, +0.26% \u00c2 with the head of the National Institutes of Health, Francis Collins, Fauci said that unlike Europe, U.S. communities \u00e2\u0080\u009cnever came down to baseline and now are surging back up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still knee-deep in the first wave.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098We have for the last three weeks been the worst in the entire country.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Will Humble, executive director of the Arizona Public Health Association Arizona reported more than 2,500 new coronavirus cases Sunday and 1,357 deaths on Monday. It now has more than 123,824 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 2,246\u00c3\u00ad deaths in total. Over the past seven days, nearly 27% of tests there were positive, the highest rate in the nation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have for the last three weeks been the worst in the entire country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Will Humble, executive director of the Arizona Public Health Association and former director of the Arizona Department of Health Services, told CBS. Meanwhile, Mayor Steve Adler of Austin, Texas, previously told CNN: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change the trajectory, we are within two weeks of having our hospitals overrun.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Citing comments by Trump that COVID-19 would go away and that 99% of cases were harmless, Adler, a Democrat, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt makes me angry. You know, I understand he has a tough job, but it is dangerous not to be sending a clear message to Americans.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner, also a Democrat, echoed those sentiments on CBS VIAC, -2.34%. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA month ago one in 10 people were testing positive. Today, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one in four,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe number of people who are getting sick and going to the hospitals has exponentially increased. The number of people in our ICU beds has exponentially increased.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Turner also said hospitals in his city could be in \u00e2\u0080\u009cserious trouble\u00e2\u0080\u009d if they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get a handle on the spread. Texas reported 8,196 new cases on Sunday, and 10,410 patients hospitalized due to coronavirus, a 25% increase in one week. There have been more than 264,810 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the state and at least 3,276 deaths. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, has warned of another lockdown if people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wear masks. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disappointing and again, I can understand the mindset being a kid who grew up in Longview myself, that this may not be the top priority. A murderer, or a rapist or a robber is far more serious to concentrate on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told local news station CBS19. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHowever, I know this also, and that is if we do not all join together and unite in this one cause for a short period of time, of adopting a mask ... it will lead to the necessity of having to close Texas back down,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe only way those businesses are going to stay open is to make sure people wear masks to slow the spread of the coronavirus.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Fauci previously said the virus may be mutating to become more transmissible, and focused on three main failings by both the public and authorities: Many states have reopened too quickly, people are not abiding by rules of social distancing, and the authorities could do a better job at contact tracing to track people who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been in contact with those who test positive. Fauci said earlier this month that America needs to balance the needs of the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic and public health. People need to practice social distancing and wear face masks, he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe do need to open up again, no doubt about it, we want to get the economy back,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to do it in a measured way, and now we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing the consequence of community spread.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Appearing to pour cold water on reports of a rift between the president and Fauci, McEnany said Monday at the White House press conference, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDr. Fauci and the president have always had a very good working relationship.\u00e2\u0080\u009d How COVID-19 is transmitted"}]}
