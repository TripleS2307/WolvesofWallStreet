This video clip might change your mind", "body": "A cartoon posted on a local newspaper\u2019s Facebook page is using the Holocaust to criticize Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly\u2019s order requiring masks to curb the spread of the coronavirus. \u201cLockdown Laura says: Put on your mask \u2026 and step onto the cattle car,\u201d the caption reads. Dane Hicks, chairman of Kansas\u2019s Anderson County Republican Party, owns the paper and defended his cartoon even as the Democratic governor called on him to remove it. \u201cThe topic here is the governmental overreach which has been the hallmark of Gov. Kelly\u2019s administration,\u201d he told the New York Times. Hicks later apologized in a statement on Facebook, saying he was removing the cartoon after \u201csome heartfelt and educational conversations\u201d with Jewish leaders.
