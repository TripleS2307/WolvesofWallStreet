Get ready for some surprises.", "body": "For all the weirdness of the past few months \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the Zoom fatigue, the challenge of caring for children and pets and aging parents alongside co-workers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the coronavirus pandemic that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kept millions of white-collar workers in their homes, not their offices, has presented new opportunities. It seemed only a matter of time before someone launched an ETF for that, and on Thursday, that fund, the Direxion Work From Home exchange-traded fund \u00e2\u0080\u0094 sporting the ticker WFH WFH, +1.46% \u00c2 , naturally \u00e2\u0080\u0094 will start trading. As it does, a look at what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inside the portfolio shows some surprises. For such a clearly delineated theme that squares so neatly with the reality of life for so many right now, one of the biggest ironies is how nuanced the fund\u00e2\u0080\u0099s holdings actually are. The fund is made up of 40 equally-weighted companies ranging from old standbys like Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +3.01% \u00c2 and Microsoft Corp MSFT, +2.48% \u00c2 to the lesser-known, like Proofpoint Inc. PFPT, +1.40% \u00c2 and Perficient Inc PRFT, +1.03%. It has of-the-moment pandemic darlings, like Zoom Video Communications Inc. ZM, +2.89% \u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and some old guards like Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co HPE, -1.80%. And its reach stretches from Shenzen, China, with companies like Xunlei Ltd. XNET, -2.84% \u00c2 , to Cincinnati Bell Inc. CBB, +0.13% \u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is global in nature, and the benefit of what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done is not just picking the poster children of the working-from-home phenomenon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual-fund research for CFRA. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis fund gives you a mixture of up-and-comers whose business model is being driven by that theme, and some megacaps that will get stock price growth from many things. This is not really a pure-play work-from-home ETF, which I think is positive.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Direxion says the fund will focus on companies that fall into four buckets representing sub-themes: remote communications, cyber security, project and document management, and cloud technologies. Rosenbluth also thinks WFH should sit in an investing sweet spot. As an index-based fund, it offers more diversification, and the benefit of stock-picking from an experienced management team, than if investors were to try to select individual stocks themselves. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot less idiosyncratic than many actively-managed funds, most notably some of the ones run by a company like ARK Invest, which represent strong convictions by a small management team about clear winners among innovative technology leaders. Related: Wall Street\u00e2\u0080\u0099s road warriors have spent the past three months grounded. How\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that working out? Still, this ETF, like any fund, will have to prove itself. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think any investors would dispute that we are going to be working from home and thus using the benefits of cloud computing and telecoms,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rosenbluth said in an interview. Investor interest and flows into the fund will likely be robust because most people agree with that thesis, he noted. But what will keep people invested is the performance of the individual companies, and thus the fund\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overall returns, Rosenbluth said. As ARK\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CEO, Cathie Wood, told MarketWatch in early June, even her team struggles to understand how much of a moat some of the early technology winners really have. WFH will charge a 45-basis point fee, track the Solactive Remote Work Index, and rebalance semiannually.
