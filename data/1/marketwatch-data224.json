Employment in the lowest earning sector remains 25% below its February level while employment in the highest wage category has fully returned to its pre-crisis level, he noted, during a discussion of the US. economic outlook sponsored by the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Stocks DJIA, +0.56% faltered on Thursday after lawmakers dimmed hopes of a package being completed, at least prior to next month\u2019s election. Another reason for the failure of the talks is counter-intuitive. The $2.2 trillion CARES Act passed in March was massive and so successful, Wilcox said. Due to the the stimulus checks sent to households, personal income has remained above its February level despite the cratering of the economy, he noted. Wilcox said the economic recovery has lost momentum and every day that a fiscal package is delayed will slow the recovery further."}]}
