Laid-off workers shouldn't get too used to the extra cash: it will likely dry up in a matter of weeks. The memorandum Trump signed Aug. 8 at his New Jersey golf club called for a \"Lost Wages Assistance\" program to distribute an additional $300 in weekly federal unemployment benefits on top of the state benefits that unemployed people typically receive. The source of that extra $300 is a $44 billion fund set aside for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan think-tank, estimates the funds won't last more than five weeks. See:This state just became the first to pay out the $300 federal unemployment add-on called for in Trump memo \u201c Nearly 1 million Americans who receive less than $100 a week would be ineligible for the add on benefit \u201d There is another significant caveat - jobless Americans are only eligible for the $300 add-on if they already receive at least $100 a week in benefits from their state. Therefore, nearly 1 million Americans who receive less than $100 a week would be ineligible for the add-on benefit, Eliza Forsythe, a labor economist and assistant professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, calculated. The Lost Wages Assistance payments aren't automatic. States must apply through FEMA for a grant \"to administer the supplemental payments for lost wages.\" States will have to pay 25% of the cost of delivering the extra $300. (The FEMA grants do not cover that expense.) Don't miss: More than 30 states are preparing to distribute an extra $300 in unemployment benefits - but how long will that last? So far no states who have applied for the FEMA grants have been rejected, Keith Turi, Assistant Administrator of Recovery at FEMA, told reporters Aug 20. At least one governor has said her state won't apply for the FEMA grant because residents don't need the extra $300. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, a Republican and Trump ally, said she won't be submitting an application. \"My administration is very grateful for the additional flexibility that this effort would have provided, but South Dakota is in the fortunate position of not needing to accept it,\" she said in a statement. \"South Dakota's economy, having never been shut down, has recovered nearly 80% of our job losses.\"Here's where things stand in states that have been approved by FEMA Alabama Alabama received FEMA's approval on Aug. 21.
