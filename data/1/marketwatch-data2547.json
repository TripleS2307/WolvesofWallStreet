Laid-off workers shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get too used to the extra cash: it will likely dry up in a matter of weeks. The memorandum Trump signed Aug. 8 at his New Jersey golf club called for a \u00e2\u0080\u009cLost Wages Assistance\u00e2\u0080\u009d program to distribute an additional $300 in weekly federal unemployment benefits on top of the state benefits that unemployed people typically receive. The source of that extra $300 is a $44 billion fund set aside for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan think-tank, estimates the funds won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t last more than five weeks. See:This state just became the first to pay out the $300 federal unemployment add-on called for in Trump memo \u201c Nearly 1 million Americans who receive less than $100 a week would be ineligible for the add on benefit \u201d There is another significant caveat \u00e2\u0080\u0094 jobless Americans are only eligible for the $300 add-on if they already receive at least $100 a week in benefits from their state. Therefore, nearly 1 million Americans who receive less than $100 a week would be ineligible for the add-on benefit, Eliza Forsythe, a labor economist and assistant professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, calculated. The Lost Wages Assistance payments aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t automatic. States must apply through FEMA for a grant \u00e2\u0080\u009cto administer the supplemental payments for lost wages.\u00e2\u0080\u009d States will have to pay 25% of the cost of delivering the extra $300. (The FEMA grants do not cover that expense.) Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss: More than 30 states are preparing to distribute an extra $300 in unemployment benefits \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but how long will that last? So far no states who have applied for the FEMA grants have been rejected, Keith Turi, Assistant Administrator of Recovery at FEMA, told reporters Aug 20. At least one governor has said her state won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t apply for the FEMA grant because residents don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need the extra $300. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, a Republican and Trump ally, said she won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be submitting an application. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy administration is very grateful for the additional flexibility that this effort would have provided, but South Dakota is in the fortunate position of not needing to accept it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSouth Dakota\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy, having never been shut down, has recovered nearly 80% of our job losses.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where things stand in states that have been approved by FEMA Alabama Alabama received FEMA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approval on Aug. 21. Based on estimates from FEMA and the U.S. Department of Labor, the Alabama Department of Labor said eligible unemployment beneficiaries could expect to receive the $300 add-on benefit \u00e2\u0080\u009din approximately three weeks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Alaska Alaska received FEMA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approval on Aug. 23. Alaskans likely won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t receive those benefits for at least six to eight weeks, Cathy Mu\u00c3\u00b1oz, Deputy Commissioner at the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, said. Arizona As of Aug. 26, more than $252 million was distributed to unemployed Arizonans to make the extra $300 payments according to Arizona\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Department of Economic Security.

At first California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat and critic of Trump, did not support the executive order. Then he decided to apply for the add-on benefit. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs I say, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look a gift horse in the mouth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said on Aug. 10. The Employment Development Department of California said it \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill begin processing LWA payments in phases for eligible individuals in the week beginning September 7, 2020.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Colorado Colorado received FEMA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approval on Aug. 16, but the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Department of Labor and Employment has \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot yet determined what the benefit amount will be nor do we have any estimate on development timelines to reprogram our systems to pay these benefits,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cher Haavind, a spokeswoman for the department, told MarketWatch.

It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not clear if the state will have to pay out an additional $100 to every jobless resident or make up the difference so that each claimant receives at least $100 a week in benefits.
