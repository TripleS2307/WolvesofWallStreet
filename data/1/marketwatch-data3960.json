Brett Giroir\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comment came a day after Trump shared a Twitter post from a former game show host who, without evidence, accused government medical experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, among others, of \u00e2\u0080\u009clying.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump himself has at times disregarded the advice of his medical experts on the task force and continues to play down the threat from the virus as it spikes across the country, forcing some states to slow or reverse steps to reopen their economies. Asked on NBC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cToday,\u00e2\u0080\u009d whether the CDC and other doctors are lying, Giroir allowed that mistakes have been made and that public guidance is updated when more is learned about the virus, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut none of us lie. We are completely transparent with the American people.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump has said on several occasion that the virus will \u00e2\u0080\u009cjust disappear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Giroir said that is unlikely \u00e2\u0080\u009cunless we take active steps to make it disappear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He appealed to people to wear masks, practice social distancing and to avoid bars and other tightly packed areas. With U.S. virus cases spiking and the death toll mounting, the White House has worked to undercut its most trusted coronavirus expert, playing down the danger as Trump pushes to get the economy moving before he faces voters in November. The U.S. has become a cautionary tale across the globe, with once-falling cases now spiraling. However, Trump suggests the severity of the pandemic that has killed more than 135,000 Americans is being overstated by critics to damage his reelection chances. Trump on Monday retweeted a post by Chuck Woolery, onetime host of TV\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cLove Connection,\u00e2\u0080\u009d claiming that \u00e2\u0080\u009cEveryone is lying\u00e2\u0080\u009d about COVID-19. Woolery\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tweet attacked not just the media and Democrats but the CDC and most doctors \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat we are told to trust. I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all about the election and keeping the economy from coming back, which is about the election.\u00e2\u0080\u009d At the same time, the president and top White House aides are ramping up attacks against Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top infectious diseases expert. Fauci has been increasingly sidelined by the White House as he sounds alarms about the virus, a most unwelcome message at a time when Trump is focused on pushing an economic rebound. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even begun to see the end of it yet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said Monday in a talk with the dean of Stanford\u00e2\u0080\u0099s medical school, calling for a \u00e2\u0080\u009cstep back\u00e2\u0080\u009d in reopenings. Last week, Fauci contradicted Trump about the severity of the virus during a FiveThirtyEight podcast. While Trump contends repeatedly that he has done a great job against the pandemic, Fauci said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs a country, when you compare us to other countries, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think you can say we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing great. I mean, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just not.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump later said Fauci had \u00e2\u0080\u009cmade a lot of mistakes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He pointed to Fauci\u00e2\u0080\u0099s early disagreement with him over the China travel ban and to the evolving guidance over the use of masks as scientists\u00e2\u0080\u0099 understanding of the virus improved \u00e2\u0080\u0094 points the White House expanded on in statements to media outlets over the weekend. Asked whether the president still had confidence in Fauci, a White House official on Monday insisted Trump did. The official said Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was regarded as \u00e2\u0080\u009ca valued voice\u00e2\u0080\u009d on the White House coronavirus task force. The official spoke on condition of anonymity even though the president has repeatedly railed against anonymous sources. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have a very good relationship with Dr. Fauci,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump told reporters Monday, calling him \u00e2\u0080\u009ca very nice person.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But the president added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always agree with him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That supportive message was not echoed by Peter Navarro, a top White House trade adviser who has been working on the coronavirus effort. See:Trump shares Chuck Woolery tweet that alleges \u00e2\u0080\u0098everyone is lying\u00e2\u0080\u0099 about the coronavirus to hurt Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s re-election chances In an email, Navarro continued to criticize Fauci to the Associated Press on Monday, saying the doctor has \u00e2\u0080\u009ca good bedside manner with the public but he has been wrong about everything I have ever interacted with him on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That includes, he said, downplaying the early risk of the virus and expressing skepticism over the use of hydroxychloroquine, which Navarro \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who is not a doctor \u00e2\u0080\u0094 has aggressively championed despite contradictory evidence on its efficacy and safety. Asked by NBC News if he was bothered by the White House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s treatment of Fauci, Giroir didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t answer directly but said \u00e2\u0080\u009cnone of us are always right and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just the way things are.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Giroir also appeared to disagree with Trump and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who have been pressuring schools to fully open in the fall, even going as far to threaten those that remain closed with the loss of some federal funds. Giroir said it was important to \u00e2\u0080\u009cget the virus under control\u00e2\u0080\u009d first. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd if we get the virus under better control, clearly kids can get back into school safely,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Fauci, who has not appeared at recent White House task force briefings and has been largely absent from television, told the Financial Times last week that he last saw Trump in person at the White House on June 2 and hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t briefed him in at least two months. He blamed the fact that he has refused to toe the administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s line for its refusal to approve many of his media requests. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have a reputation, as you probably have figured out, of speaking the truth at all times and not sugar-coating things. And that may be one of the reasons why I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been on television very much lately,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Fauci said. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s political foes put it more strongly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disgusting attempt to pass the buck by blaming the top infectious disease expert in the country \u00e2\u0080\u0094 whose advice he repeatedly ignored and Joe Biden consistently implored him to take \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is yet another horrible and revealing failure of leadership as the tragic death toll continues to needlessly grow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Democrat Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidential campaign."}]}
