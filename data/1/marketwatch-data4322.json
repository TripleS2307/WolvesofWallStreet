GPS, -0.10% stock jumped 6.3% in Monday premarket trading after it was upgraded to overweight from underweight at Wells Fargo, a call that analysts said was \"idiosyncratic.\" Wells Fargo raised its price target to $19 from $8. The market has taken Gap's \"fundamental struggles\" into account, but Wells Fargo thinks there are two positive factors that are underappreciated: the Athleta brand and the company's real estate. \"[E]ven though athleisure has clearly accelerated due to the pandemic, this has not translated into a value appreciation for the Athleta brand within Gap,\" analysts led by Ike Boruchow wrote. The value of Gap's real estate holdings, which includes its San Francisco headquarters and four distribution centers, total $1.9 billion. Analysts also value the Old Navy brand at $5 billion. Gap stock is down 39.7% for the year to date while the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% has fallen 4.1% for the period."}]}
