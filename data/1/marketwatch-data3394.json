If you guessed Apple AAPL, +1.74% \u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the most valuable today, with a market capitalization above $2 trillion\u00e2\u0080\u0094you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be wrong. In 2010, occupying the No. 1 spot was oil giant ExxonMobil XOM, -1.47%. Returns since then? Zero. The stock has dropped from $61 to about $41, and even with dividends you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve barely broken even \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s before counting taxes and trading costs, let alone inflation. During the same period a standard, low-cost U.S. stock-market index fund has quadrupled your money. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true for the SPDR 500 Trust SPY, +0.89%, which follows the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% \u00c2 large-company index; the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index fund VTI, +0.84%, which follows that company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s index of large, midsize and small companies; and many others. OK \u00e2\u0080\u0094 what was the most valuable company in the world five years before that, in 2005? If you thought it was still Exxon, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be 0 for 2. Actually in early 2005 it was General Electric Co. GE, +2.85%. \u00c2 Returns since then: minus 70%. Yes, indeed. Even including reinvested dividends (and ignoring taxes, trading costs and inflation \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we should all be so lucky). How about a few years before that? The biggest company on the stock market was Microsoft MSFT, +2.48%, and in 2001 it was briefly the megabank Citigroup C, +0.47%. Microsoft has been a terrific investment over that period \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but only if you hung on for more than a decade. As for Citigroup: If you bought the stock in 2001, when it was the stock market\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most valuable company, today you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have lost 85% of your money. Yes, really. (And, once again, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s before deducting the costs you pay in the real world.) Go back to the 1980s and it would appear the stock market really anticipated the technology boom, because the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most valuable company was a computer maker. Alas, it was IBM IBM, -2.81%. Love those mainframes! Oh, it made typewriters, too. OK, so this might look like a game. No doubt Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legion of stockholders and other fans will argue that the company is no IBM, or GE, or Exxon, or Citigroup, so the analogy won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t apply. And all analogies break down eventually, so of course that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true. But there is serious research that shows not only that putting your money on the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most valuable company has tended to be a poor long-term investment but that betting on the most valuable company in each sector has been, too. From around 1950 to 2010, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe leader in any sector underperforms the average stock (equally weighted) in its own sector by nearly 4% in the next year \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and the next year \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and the next year. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Put another way, with compounding, the top stock in the 12 U.S. market sectors declined 28% in value in 10 years, relative to the average stock in its respective sector, over the past 59 years.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yikes. Does this mean Apple is going to be a terrible investment over the next decade? No, of course not. As the late Casey Stengel advised: Never make predictions, especially about the future. But. If Apple makes up a big chunk of your 401(k), IRA or other retirement account, do the math. Sorry. Apple investors have become used to the most staggering stock-market returns. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve averaged 28% a year for 20 years. And so far the stock has earned them more than 70% \u00e2\u0080\u0094 yes, really \u00e2\u0080\u0094 since the start of this year. But in recent years, something has been happening that many investors may not fully appreciate. Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stock has been rising far faster than its per-share earnings. So in five years the stock has gone from $100 to $500. But during the same period the per-share earnings have risen only from $9 to $13. At 33 times forecast earnings for the next 12 months, Apple is now more expensive in relation to fundamentals than at any time since 2007\u00e2\u0080\u0094when the iPhone was new, and the company was one-twentieth of its current size, with gigantic room to grow. If you are expecting Apple to earn you 28% a year ahead, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re betting that in five years\u00e2\u0080\u0099 time the company will be not America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first $2 trillion company, but the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first $7 trillion company. Since 2015 Apple has gone from 11 times forecast earnings to 33 times. By 2025 are we expecting it to rise to 99 times? Just asking."}]}
