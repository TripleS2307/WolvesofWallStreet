Kyle Rittenhouse, of Antioch, Illinois, about 15 miles from Kenosha, was taken into custody in Illinois on suspicion of first-degree intentional homicide in the rifle attack Tuesday night that was largely captured on cellphone video. A third person was wounded. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } \u201cI just killed somebody,\u201d he could be heard saying at one point during the shooting rampage that erupted just before midnight. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Blake\u2019s shooting set off three nights of unrest in the city midway between Milwaukee and Chicago. In the wake of the killings, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers authorized the sending of 500 members of the National Guard to Kenosha, doubling the number of troops. The governor\u2019s office said he is working with other states to bring in additional National Guard members and law officers. Authorities also announced a 7 p.m. curfew, an hour earlier than the night before. \u201cA senseless tragedy like this cannot happen again,\u201d the governor, a Democrat, said in a statement. \u201cI again ask those who choose to exercise their First Amendment rights please do so peacefully and safely, as so many did last night. I also ask the individuals who are not there to exercise those rights to please stay home and let local first responders, law enforcement and members of the Wisconsin National Guard do their jobs.\u201d In Washington, the Justice Department said it is sending in more than 200 federal agents from the FBI, U.S. Marshals Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in response to the unrest. The White House said up to 2,000 National Guard troops would be made available. And in Orlando, the NBA\u2019s Milwaukee Bucks, a team based in Wisconsin, didn\u2019t take the floor for their playoff game against the Magic. It was later announced that all three NBA playoff games scheduled for Wednesday were postponed, with players around the league choosing to boycott in their strongest statement yet against racial injustice. The dead were identified only as a 26-year-old Silver Lake, Wisconsin, resident and a 36-year-old from Kenosha. The wounded person, a 36-year-old from West Allis, Wisconsin, was expected to survive, police said. \u201cWe were all chanting \u2018Black lives matter\u2019 at the gas station and then we heard, boom, boom, and I told my friend, \u2018That\u2019s not fireworks,\u2019\u201d 19-year-old protester Devin Scott told the Chicago Tribune. \u201cAnd then this guy with this huge gun runs by us in the middle of the street and people are yelling, \u2018He shot someone! He shot someone!\u2019 And everyone is trying to fight the guy, chasing him and then he started shooting again.\u201d Scott said he cradled a lifeless victim in his arms, and a woman started performing CPR, but \u201cI don\u2019t think he made it.\u201d According to witness accounts and video footage, police apparently let the gunman walk past them and leave the scene with a rifle over his shoulder and his hands in the air as members of the crowd were yelling for him to be arrested because he had shot people. As for how the gunman managed to leave the scene, Sheriff David Beth portrayed a chaotic, high-stress situation, with screaming, chanting, nonstop radio traffic and people running all over \u2014 conditions he said can cause \u201ctunnel vision\u201d among law officers. Rittenhouse was assigned a public defender in Illinois for a hearing Friday on his transfer to Wisconsin. The public defender\u2019s office had no comment. Under Wisconsin law, anyone 17 or older is treated as an adult in the criminal justice system. Much of Rittenhouse\u2019s Facebook page is devoted to praising law enforcement, with references to Blue Lives Matter, a movement that supports police. He also can be seen holding an assault rifle. Other photographs include those of badges of various law enforcement agencies, including the Chicago Police Department. All of the badges have a black line across them \u2014 something police officers typically do with black tape when an officer is killed in the line of duty. In a photograph posted by his mother, he is wearing what appears to be a blue law enforcement uniform as well as the kind of brimmed hat that state troopers wear. The sheriff told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that militia members or armed vigilantes had been patrolling Kenosha\u2019s streets in recent nights, but he did not know if the gunman was among them. However, video taken before the shooting shows police tossing bottled water from an armored vehicle to what appear to be armed civilians walking the streets. And one of them appears to be the gunman. \u201cWe appreciate you being here,\u201d an officer is heard saying to the group over a loudspeaker. Before the shooting, the conservative website The Daily Caller conducted a video interview with the suspected gunman in front of a boarded-up business. \u201cSo people are getting injured, and our job is to protect this business,\u201d the young man said. \u201cAnd part of my job is to also help people. If there is somebody hurt, I\u2019m running into harm\u2019s way. That\u2019s why I have my rifle \u2014 because I can protect myself, obviously. But I also have my med kit.\u201d Sam Dirks, 22, from Milwaukee, said he had seen the gunman earlier in the evening, and he was yelling at some of the protesters. \u201cHe was definitely very agitated. He was pacing around, just pointing his gun in general. Not necessarily at anyone specifically,\u201d Dirks said. Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who is Black, said in an interview with the news program \u201cDemocracy Now!\u201d that the shootings were not surprising and that white militias have been ignored for too long. \u201cHow many times across this country do you see armed gunmen, protesting, walking into state Capitols, and everybody just thinks it\u2019s OK?\u201d Barnes said. \u201cPeople treat that like it\u2019s some kind of normal activity that people are walking around with assault rifles.\u201d In Wisconsin, it is legal for people 18 and over to openly carry a gun, with no license required. Witness accounts and video indicate the shootings took place in two stages: The gunman first shot someone at a car lot, then jogged away, fell in the street, and opened fire again as members of the crowd closed in on him. A witness, Julio Rosas, 24, said that when the gunman stumbled, \u201ctwo people jumped onto him and there was a struggle for control of his rifle. At that point during the struggle, he just began to fire multiple rounds, and that dispersed people near him.\u201d \u201cThe rifle was being jerked around in all directions while it was being fired,\u201d Rosas said. Blake was shot in the back seven times on Sunday as he leaned into his SUV, three of his children seated inside. Kenosha police have said little about what happened other than that they were responding to a domestic dispute. The officer who shot Blake was Rusten Sheskey, a seven-year veteran of the Kenosha Police Department, the state Department of Justice said Wednesday. Sheskey shot Blake while holding onto his shirt after officers first unsuccessfully used a Taser, the agency\u2019s news release said. State agents later recovered a knife from the driver\u2019s side floorboard of the vehicle, authorities said. A search of the vehicle located no additional weapons. No charges were announced and the state Department of Investigation was continuing to investigate. On Tuesday, Ben Crump, the lawyer for Blake\u2019s family, said it would \u201ctake a miracle\u201d for Blake to walk again. He called for the officer who opened fire to be arrested and for the others involved to lose their jobs. The shooting was captured on cellphone video and ignited new protests in the U.S. three months after the death of George Floyd under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer touched off a nationwide reckoning over racial injustice. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden posted a video saying he had spoken with Blake\u2019s parents and other family members. \u201cWhat I saw on that video makes me sick,\u201d Biden said. \u201cOnce again, a Black man, Jacob Blake, has been shot by the police in broad daylight, with the whole world watching.\u201d"}]}
