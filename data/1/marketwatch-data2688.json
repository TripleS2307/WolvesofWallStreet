The office of Secretary of State Frank LaRose said he would soon appeal the decision by Franklin County Common Pleas Judge Richard Frye, assuming the judge follows through and invalidates the secretary\u2019s drop-box order. For now, Frye\u2019s ruling doesn\u2019t change anything, LaRose spokesperson Maggie Sheehan said in a written statement, \u201cand the Secretary\u2019s directive remains in place.\u201d \u201c It is often the largely Democratic urban counties \u2014 such as Cuyahoga, home to Cleveland \u2014 that look to expand the number of drop boxes. Cuyahoga must serve more than 860,000 registered voters with only a single drop box under Secretary of State Frank LaRose\u2019s order. \u201d Access to ballot drop boxes has become an urgent matter nationally, with in-person voting options restricted by the coronavirus pandemic and the efficiency and security of mail-in voting questioned amid cutbacks at the U.S. Postal Service. It is often the largely Democratic urban counties \u2014 such as Cuyahoga, home to Cleveland \u2014 that look to expand the number of drop boxes. Cuyahoga must serve more than 860,000 registered voters with only a single drop box under LaRose\u2019s order. The Ohio Democratic Party and a coalition of voting rights group sued LaRose last month over the directive, calling it unconstitutional. It prohibited election boards from installing more than one drop box located at the county board of elections, effectively holding the boxes to the number lawmakers made available in Ohio\u2019s presidential primary. LaRose cited a state election law that says absentee ballots must be \u201cdelivered by mail or personally\u201d to a voter\u2019s county election director. He has said that he personally supports counties adding more drop boxes, but that he lacks the legal authority to expand the number beyond the one established in law. But Frye said the wording of the law makes \u201cdeliver\u201d ambiguous: \u201cIt does not squarely answer whether drop boxes are permitted, or if so how many boxes may be used, or where they may be located by a board of elections.\u201d Because the law is vague, Frye said, counties must be legally permitted to explore placing additional boxes. \u201cWhile the secretary has broad discretion to issue Directives and otherwise guide local boards of elections, his actions must be reasonable to be legally enforceable,\u201d Frye wrote. \u201cWholly arbitrary rules are entitled to no deference.\u201d In response to the ruling, state Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper called for LaRose to rise to the occasion. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the Secretary of State to do what he has told the public and officials that he would do,\u201d Pepper tweeted. \u201cNo more delays. No more appeals. No more wasted time.\u201d The drop box decision was the third issue to confront LaRose since Friday, when a county judge ordered him to allow voters to apply for absentee ballots for the November presidential election by electronic means, including by fax or email. That decision was stayed Saturday as an appeal proceeds. On Monday, fellow Republicans on the powerful state Controlling Board voted against LaRose\u2019s proposal to use funds from his office\u2019s Business Services budget to pay for postage on every mail-in ballot in the state."}]}
