AFP via Getty Images \u201cFour more years!\u201d is what you\u2019d expect to hear at one of President Donald Trump\u2019s rallies\u2014that is if he could hold them. The pandemic put an end to that. But beyond his base\u2014mostly white, mostly male, mostly older voters living in mostly rural America\u2014you know who else is hoping for another four years of Trump? Chinese President Xi Jinping and his authoritarian communist government. This may come as news to Trump, who claims that China is \u201cdesperate\u201d to have former Vice President Joe Biden win the presidency. Why? Because a Biden win, the president tweeted recently, would mean that Beijing \u201ccan continue to rip-off the United States, as they have done for decades, until I came along!\u201d Really? That\u2019s funny, because the truth is quite different. China would love another four years of Trump. It is salivating for another four years of Trump. In Beijing, the choice is clear: Trump\u2019s the man. \u201cZ\u00e0i s\u00ec ni\u00e1n!\u201d Four more years! Follow the latest developments in Election 2020 How can this be? After all, the president claims no has been tougher on China than him. But the disconnect that Trump has never understood, is that for all of his efforts to make America great, he has inflicted tremendous damage not on China, but on the United States. America divided He inherited an America that was already divided among cultural, racial and economic lines and made things worse with nearly four years of an us-versus-them divisiveness that has further weakened our nation. Thanks to this president, Americans seem pitted against each other with an intensity and vitriol that hasn\u2019t been seen since the Civil War. This is the greatest gift that Xi Jinping (and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin, by the way) could ever ask for. However much Trump thinks he has hammered China, the damage he has done to American power and prestige, America\u2019s reputation, America\u2019s adherence to democratic values and global institutions, far outweighs whatever damage he has done to China. And what damage has he done to China? \u201cTrade wars are easy to win, believe me,\u201d Trump famously said (he now denies saying this), but the reality is quite different. He keeps saying that thanks to tariffs, China is paying us billions. He has never understood that tariff is just another word for a tax on American consumers, the end users who always bear the brunt of import duties. Don\u2019t take my word for it, just ask most economists and even the Federal Reserve, which said that Trump\u2019s strategy led to job losses and higher prices in the United States. \u201cThe tariffs, thus far, have not led to increased activity in the U.S. manufacturing sector,\u201d the Fed says. Then there\u2019s JPMorgan Chase, which has estimated that the cost to the average American household from Trump\u2019s tariffs was about $1,000. Wouldn\u2019t you like to have an extra thousand bucks right now? TPP failure Beijing also got a good laugh three days into Trump\u2019s term when the new president yanked the U.S. out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement between the United States and 11 Pacific Rim countries\u2014but not China, which by design, was excluded. This was one of the main TPP goals: to maintain American trade dominance in Asia and ward off China\u2019s growing economic clout. It also would have, according to research by the Peterson Institute, boosted U.S. exports by $123 billion. (In fairness it should be noted that Hillary Clinton, as a sop to the left, also came out against TPP and may have scrapped it had she won). In any case, Trump killed it. What has happened since? America\u2019s void has been filled\u2014you guessed it\u2014by China. The trade pact, now rebranded as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, \u201cwould give China greater access to markets with more than half a billion people, which will be among the world\u2019s most attractive in the years to come,\u201d notes the Nikkei Asian Review, and also offer China \u201ca free trade bridge to the Americas as it includes Canada, Chile, Mexico and Peru.\u201dExtortionist in chief On a lesser but highly symbolic scale, Trump\u2019s demands that the U.S. government get a slice of any potential sale of the U.S. operations of TikTok, the Chinese-born video app that\u2019s wildly popular with young people around the world, shows him to be not a capitalist, but an extortionist. Forget the free market. We have a president who thinks its perfectly normal to parachute into a private-sector deal and demand some sort of payoff in return for greenlighting the deal. Shaking down the private sector? Why not? Foreign nations that are steeped In corruption themselves\u2014like China\u2014look at this and countless other actions and cheer the damage that Trump is doing to cherished American values like rule of law, and know that our global reputation is tarnished, and with it, our credibility. Last month Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave a speech in which he blasted China\u2019s human-rights record, its suppression of ethnic minorities, crackdowns on the press and more. Pompeo\u2019s points were valid, but the fact that they were being expressed on behalf of an administration that itself dabbles in such things undermines what the administration presumes is some sort of American moral authority. This is the damage being done. China loves it. The Russians love it. Four more years? The answer in Beijing, Moscow and the capitals of other bad actors is: Yes, please."}]}
