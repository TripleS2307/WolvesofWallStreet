Though they\u2019ve promised to shed at least half of their wealth for the common good, many of the billionaires who have signed the Giving Pledge are richer than ever, the Institute for Policy Studies said; it added that, \u201cwhile some pledgers earnestly intend to fulfill their promises, many are unable to because their assets are simply growing too fast.\u201d The list of pledgers includes well-known business figures such as Tesla TSLA, +1.89% co-founder Elon Musk, Virgin SPCE, -3.12% Group founder Richard Branson, hedge fund manager Ray Dalio, Netflix NFLX, +1.43% CEO Reed Hastings and former Citigroup CITI, +1.05% CEO Sanford Weill. \u201c \u2018Instead of supporting charities on the front lines of problem solving, these billions end up sitting in tax-advantaged intermediaries.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Chuck Collins, co-author of \u2018Gilded Giving 2020: How Wealth Inequality Distorts Philanthropy and Imperils Democracy\u2019 But they soon ran into a problem. Their giving can\u2019t keep up with their escalating fortunes. The combined wealth of the 62 living U.S. pledgers who were billionaires in 2010 has increased by 95%, from $376 billion in 2010 to $734 billion as of July 18, 2020, according to \u201cGilded Giving 2020,\u201d a report from the Institute for Policy Studies, a left-leaning think tank. If these pledgers want to make good on their promises, they\u2019ll have to \u201cdramatically accelerate their giving just to keep up with their asset growth,\u201d the report added. One notable exception to the list of Giving Pledge signers: the world\u2019s richest individual, Jeff Bezos, whose current net worth is roughly $189 billion. He and his ex-wife launched a $2 billion philanthropic venture called Day One Fund in 2018 to address homeless and preschool education for low-income children. Earlier this year, Bezos pledged $10 billion to address climate change. (Amazon did not respond to a request for comment.) Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A, +0.06% CEO Warren Buffett and Microsoft MSFT, +2.48% co-founder Bill Gates and his wife Melinda Gates announced the Giving Pledge in August 2010. People who sign the Giving Pledge promise publicly to give away at least half their wealth, either during their lifetimes or in their wills. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of the best of capitalism,\u201d Bill Gates said in the first TV interview about the Giving Pledge, saying that people who had made a lot of money could then use their wealth to \u201ccreate good circumstances for other people.\u2019\u201d A decade later, 11 of the 62 living signers who were billionaires in 2010 have seen their wealth decline because of \u201caggressive\u201d charitable giving or market changes, the Institute for Policy Studies found. But the other 51 are earning money so fast they\u2019re having a hard time giving it away, the report found. \u201cThe Giving Pledge is a textbook case of top-heavy philanthropy in action,\u201d it added. \u201cWhat was intended to be a civic-minded initiative to encourage generosity is, instead, continuing the concentration of taxpayer-subsidized private charitable power.\u201dSome argue that taxpayers lose out Charitable giving is partly subsidized by taxpayers, and the Institute for Policy Studies argues that for every dollar a billionaire gives to charity, \u201cthe rest of us chip in as much as 74 cents to make up for the lost revenue.\u201d The organization has advocated for reforming charity laws to prevent money from being \u201csequestered\u201d in private foundations and donor-advised funds. \u201cDonors should only receive a tax reduction if funds are deployed to serve the public interest in a timely way,\u201d according to its \u201cGilded Giving\u201d report. Warren Buffett, who has called for higher taxes for the wealthy, recently said that he received \u201conly minor benefits\u201d from tax deductions related to his philanthropy \u2014 his combined federal and state income taxes were reduced by about 43 cents for every $1,000 of value he\u2019s donated in the form of Berkshire Hathaway Class B shares, he said. Buffett dropped to eighth place on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index after a $2.9 billion stock donation in July. But others say the Giving Pledge represents an extraordinary achievement. \u201cThe Giving Pledge was an historic moment in the history of philanthropy because it created a new kind of public accountability for generosity, at least in theory,\u201d said Jacob Harold, executive vice president of Candid, an organization that provides information on nonprofits and foundations. \u201cThat said, billionaires are made possible by inequality and we as a society are wrestling with that right now. I would argue that if billionaires exist, I\u2019m glad they\u2019re giving their money away and I\u2019m glad there\u2019s a mechanism to organize that.\u201d Since it was first launched, 210 people from 23 countries have signed the Giving Pledge. \u201cThe Giving Pledge is a multi-generational effort to help shift the social norms of philanthropy among the world\u2019s wealthiest people and inspire people to give more, establish their giving plans sooner, and give in effective and impactful ways,\u201d said Robert Rosen, director of Philanthropic Partnerships at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, speaking on behalf of the Giving Pledge. He added that the signers \u201care solidifying a new standard of generosity for billionaires \u2014 that they have a moral obligation to commit to giving the majority of their wealth to philanthropy to address society\u2019s most pressing needs.\u201d\u2018Giving away money well is very hard\u2019 Some Giving Pledgers may appear to be giving away their money slower than critics would like because spending money for the common good is more difficult than it looks, two experts told MarketWatch. \u201cGiving away money well is very hard,\u201d said Avery Fontaine, head of Strategic Philanthropy for BNY Mellon Wealth Management. \u201cIt seems like the greatest job in the world. It\u2019s incredibly stressful.\u201d She added, \u201cThat sounds like an \u2018Oh, poor me,\u2019 type thing to say for any wealthy person,\u201d but Fontaine noted that many donors feel personally responsible for the success or failure of the endeavors they fund. \u201c \u2018The intelligent distribution of money for good can be a more challenging exercise than making money in the first place.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Jacob Harold, executive vice president of Candid, an organization that provides information on nonprofits and foundation Because \u201cmega-donors\u201d have such high visibility \u2014 especially in the age of Twitter TWTR, -0.23% and Facebook FB, +0.26% \u2014 many wealthy families try to do their giving as anonymously as possible. One way to stay private is to donate to a donor-advised fund, a giving vehicle that\u2019s been criticized for its lack of transparency. \u201cIt\u2019s not that they\u2019re up to anything, they just want the opportunity to fail and learn and grow without a lot of scrutiny,\u201d Fontaine said. Jacob Harold of Candid made a similar observation. \u201cThe intelligent distribution of money for good can be a more challenging exercise than making money in the first place, and I think that\u2019s why a lot of givers have not ramped up their giving,\u201d he said. The recent $1.7 billion gift from MacKenzie Scott \u2014 ex-wife of Amazon AMZN, +3.01% founder and CEO Jeff Bezos \u2014 to 116 nonprofits offered a \u201cvery interesting solution to this puzzle,\u201d he said. Others could learn from Scott\u2019s example of giving out a large amount of money relatively quickly and making the donations \u201cunrestricted,\u201d meaning that the nonprofits who got the money can use the funds however they see fit. \u201cThat is a gesture of trust and humility,\u201d Harold said.Where has the Giving Pledge money gone? Each Giving Pledge signer writes a public letter explaining their motivations for signing the pledge, but beyond that, there\u2019s no official accounting of where pledgers donate their money, or running tally of how much pledgers have donated. They give to a wide variety of causes: the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has focused on global health problems like malaria and HIV and education in the U.S.; Salesforce CRM, +2.21% CEO Marc Benioff and his wife Lynne have given to help solve homelessness and to children\u2019s hospitals; Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong started an effort to give direct payments in the form of cryptocurrency to people living in poverty. Critics like the Institute for Policy Studies argue that many Giving Pledge signers make their donations to their own private family foundations or to donor-advised funds (DAFs), which means they get a tax break, but that the money may not trickle down quickly to on-the-ground charities. (DAFs are accounts where people can put money they intend to give to charity. Donors get an immediate tax deduction, but can decide later which nonprofits get the money.) \u201c Michael Bloomberg\u2019s $1.8 billion gift to Johns Hopkins University to provide financial aid and eliminate the need for student loans is among one of \u2018game changing\u2019 donations \u201d \u2014 Una Osili, associate dean for research and international programs at Indiana University\u2019s Lilly Family School of Philanthropy \u201cInstead of supporting charities on the front lines of problem solving, these billions end up sitting in tax-advantaged intermediaries,\u201d Chuck Collins, director the Program on Inequality and co-author of the report \u201cGilded Giving 2020: How Wealth Inequality Distorts Philanthropy and Imperils Democracy,\u201d wrote in a recent opinion piece. Another criticism that\u2019s been leveled against Giving Pledgers is that their gifts have gone to \u201cmore traditional causes\u201d like education and health, said Una Osili, associate dean for research and international programs at Indiana University\u2019s Lilly Family School of Philanthropy. \u201cBut if you dig a little deeper, you\u2019ll see that that may be too simplistic,\u201d Osili told MarketWatch. Some pledgers have made \u201cgame-changing\u201d donations, she noted, pointing to Michael Bloomberg\u2019s $1.8 billion gift to Johns Hopkins University to provide financial aid and eliminate the need for student loans, and recent efforts on COVID-19 testing by the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative, the charitable organization founded by Facebook FB, +0.26% CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan. (CZI did not respond to a request for comment.) Bloomberg \u2014 whose net worth is currently estimated at $54.9 billion \u2014 has given $8.65 billion through Bloomberg Philanthropies since signing the Giving Pledge in 2010. \u201cMike\u2019s lifetime giving to date is over $10 billion \u2014 and his giving has increased every year of his life,\u201d said Bloomberg Philanthropies spokeswoman Rachel Nagler. Bloomberg has said he plans to give away the vast majority of his wealth in his lifetime, she added. \u201cHis joke has always been that he plans to \u2018bounce the check to the undertaker,\u2019\u201d Nagler said."}]}
