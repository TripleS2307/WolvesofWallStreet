Getty Images Any investor in the painful position of being caught on the short side of the Tesla juggernaut would certainly be forgiven for keeping a low profile, considering the stock\u00e2\u0080\u0099s incredible run. But Stanphyl Capital\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Mark Spiegel, in a recent letter to investors highlighted on the ValueWalk blog, reiterated the anti-Tesla thesis that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been spouting for years, while acknowledging the carnage that his short position has caused to his broader portfolio. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYear-to-date, Tesla\u00c2 (the biggest bubble in modern stock market history) is up an astounding 495%\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and that hurt us\u00c2 significantly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote.\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo our short positions have obliterated the profits from our long positions, and yet when this bubble pops we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be glad we have them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d From there, he touched on the bullet points as to why he believes he will ultimately profit from Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s demise, including the lack of a moat and a return to red ink once emission credit sales expire. He also tore into CEO Elon Musk, who he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been consistently been painting as a fraud. \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098Need I say more about what an\u00c2 insane bubble \u00c2 this stock is? Okay, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll say more\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Mark Spiegel \u00e2\u0080\u009cSuperior competition\u00e2\u0080\u009d will also be a huge factor going forward, Spiegel explained, with growing electric lineups from Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Volvo and Volkswagen, to name just a few. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor those who still think \u00e2\u0080\u0098Tesla is years ahead of the competition,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the most competitive EV region in the world is Europe, and Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s EV market share there has now declined from over 30% to a year-end estimate of single digits,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote, pointing to this chart: iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Meanwhile, Tesla shares TSLA, +1.89% took a hit on Tuesday, after the company took advantage of the stock\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best monthly performance in seven years to raise more capital. Before the offering was disclosed, the stock was\u00c2 up as much as 7.9% premarket. The broader stock market, however, finished in the green, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56%, S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39% all firmly in positive territory."}]}
