Total domestic nonfinancial debt rose at a record seasonally adjusted annual rate of 25.3% in the April-June quarter to $59.3 trillion. That\u2019s above the prior record of 19.25% during 1985. What happened: Federal government debt increased a record 58.9% in the second quarter to $22.58 trillion, up from a 11.4% gain in the first quarter. Congress has approved $2.89 trillion in coronavirus relief spending this year. Household debt rose 0.5%, with consumer credit down at a 6.6% annual rate. Mortgage debt grew at a 3% rate. Nonfinancial business debt rose at a 14% rate in the second quarter, down from a record 18.4% in the first three months of the year. Total household net worth rose 6.8% to $119 trillion in the second quarter as stocks rose and households received government checks. Big picture: Economists recognize that the government\u2019s emergency actions are warranted but are worried the spike in debt could affect growth in the future. The U.S. had an unsustainable long-term fiscal picture even before the pandemic struck this year. At some point, taxes will have to be raised and spending will need to be trimmed. What are they saying: \u201cIt\u2019s an issue. I hope it doesn\u2019t become a problem,\u201d said Robert Brusca, chief economist at FAO Economics. Market reaction: Stocks were down sharply on Monday with the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% down 77 points in early afternoon trading."}]}
