RTX, -1.46%. GE Aviation revenue fell 44% to $4.38 billion, missing the FactSet consensus of $4.62 billion. Meanwhile, Raytheon reported Tuesday that Collins Aerospace sales fell 35% to $4.30 billion, above expectations of $3.56 billion, according to FactSet. And Honeywell International Inc. HON, +0.34% reported on July 24 aerospace sales that dropped 28% to $2.54 billion, but beat the FactSet consensus of $2.41 billion. Scarola said despite his \"poor outlook for GE's demand and cost performance,\" he was keeping his rating at hold, as the 40% year-to-date decline leaves shares near fair value. Over the same time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% has lost 6.9%."}]}
