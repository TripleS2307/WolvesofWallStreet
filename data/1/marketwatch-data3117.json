The number of people receiving traditional jobless benefits through the states, meanwhile, declined to 18 million in the week ended June 27 from 18.8 million. These are known as continuing claims. If all eight state and federal assistance programs are included, continuing claims totaled an unadjusted 32.9 million in the seven days ended June 20, the most recent data available. That marks an increase from 31.5 million in the prior week. Following the data, gold futures spent time paring some of the losses they saw shortly before the release. U.S. benchmark stock indexes were trading lower as gold futures settled, but the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% and Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39% have held onto gains for the week so far. \u201cIf investors truly believed that the economy was returning to pre-pandemic levels soon, gold wouldn\u2019t be standing today at [a] 9-year high, so it\u2019s evident that investors who are participating in this risk-on rally are also hedging their positions by adding safe havens for their safety net,\u201d said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, in a market update.

Prices on Thursday touched a low of $1,799.60. Precious metals have mostly benefited from expectations for a lengthy period of government and central bank stimulus to support economies harmed by the COVID-19 pandemic, but some analysts say that July also has been a seasonally strong period for gold due to heightened physical demand and appetite from exchange-traded funds. The World Gold Council said that global net inflows for gold-backed exchange-traded funds reached $39.5 billion, topping the previous annual inflow record of $23 billion from 2016, according to a report issued Tuesday. Softness in the U.S. dollar, which commodities tend to be priced in also has provided some support to precious metals, some experts say. The ICE U.S. Dollar index DXY, -0.58% was up 0.3% on Thursday, but the gauge of a half-dozen currencies has been down 0.6% so far this week, according to FactSet data. \u201cThe most significant development [in the market] seems to concern the breakout in the precious metals given ongoing U.S. dollar weakness at a time when yields also remain weak,\u201d wrote Mark Newton, technical analyst at Newton Advisors, in a Thursday research report. \u201cThis time in July should be a sweet-spot for metals strength, and overweighting silver and gold should be favored for additional upside in the weeks ahead,\u201d he wrote. Meanwhile, September silver US:SIU20 lost 20 cents, or 1%, at $18.962 an ounce, following its 2.5% surge on Wednesday to the highest level for a most-active contract since September 2019. For the week, silver futures have gained more than 3% so far. James Hatzigiannis, chief market strategist at Ploutus Capital Advisors, told MarketWatch that he\u2019s \u201cvery bullish on silver,\u201d and that it\u2019s likely to outpace the move in gold for the rest of the year. He believes silver could easily reach the $25 level, \u201cunless we see a corona[virus] cure.\u201d Further spread of the pandemic will \u201ccause silver to move up as the dollar should decrease in value ...and silver mining production will start to shut down again,\u201d said Hatzigiannis. Elsewhere on Comex, September copper US:HGU20 settled 0.5%, higher at $2.8385 a pound. October platinum PLV20, +3.99% fell by 4.2% to $846.90 an ounce, while September palladium US:PAU20 tacked on 1.3% to $1,963.20 an ounce, bringing its weekly gain thus far to nearly 1.9%."}]}
