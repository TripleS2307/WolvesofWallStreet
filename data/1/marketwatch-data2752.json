But the new postmaster general, Louis DeJoy, disputed reports that his agency is slowing down election mail or any other mail and said it has \u201cample capacity to deliver all election mail securely and on time\u201d for the November presidential contest, when a significant increase in mail-in ballots is expected. Still, DeJoy offered a gloomy picture of the 630,00-employee agency Friday in his first public remarks since taking the top job in June. \u201cOur financial position is dire, stemming from substantial declines in mail volume, a broken business model and a management strategy that has not adequately addressed these issues,\u2019\u2019 DeJoy told the postal board of governors at a meeting Friday. \u201cWithout dramatic change, there is no end in sight,\u2019\u2019 DeJoy said. While package deliveries to homebound Americans were up more than 50%, that was offset by continued declines in first-class and business mail, even as costs increased significantly to pay for personal protective equipment and replace workers who got sick or chose to stay home in fear of the virus, DeJoy said. Without an intervention from Congress, the agency faces an impending cash flow crisis, he said. The Postal Service is seeking an infusion of at least $10 billion to cover operating losses as well as regulatory changes that would undo a congressional requirement that the agency pre-fund billions of dollars in retiree health benefits. The agency is doing its part, said DeJoy, a Republican fundraiser and former supply chain executive who took command of the agency June 15. DeJoy, 63, of North Carolina, is a major donor to President Donald Trump and the Republican Party. He is the first postmaster general in nearly two decades who is not a career postal employee. In his first month on the job, DeJoy said, he directed the agency to vigorously \u201cfocus on the ingrained inefficiencies in our operations,\u2019\u2019 including by applying strict limits on overtime. \u201cBy running our operations on time and on schedule, and by not incurring unnecessary overtime or other costs, we will enhance our ability to be sustainable and ... continue to provide high-quality, affordable service,\u2019\u2019 DeJoy said. While not acknowledging widespread complaints by members of Congress about delivery delays nationwide, DeJoy said the agency will \u201caggressively monitor and quickly address service issues.\u2019\u2019 DeJoy\u2019s remarks came as lawmakers from both parties called on the Postal Service to immediately reverse operational changes that are causing delays in deliveries across the country just as big volume increases are expected for mail-in election voting. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Thursday that changes imposed by DeJoy \u201cthreaten the timely delivery of mail \u2014 including medicines for seniors, paychecks for workers and absentee ballots for voters \u2014 that is essential to millions of Americans.\u2019\u2019 In his remarks to the postal board of governors, DeJoy called election mail handling \u201ca robust and proven process.\u201d While there will \u201clikely be an unprecedented increase in election mail volume due to the pandemic, the Postal Service has ample capacity to deliver all election mail securely and on time in accordance with our delivery standards, and we will do so,\u201d DeJoy said. \u201cHowever ... we cannot correct the errors of (state and local) election boards if they fail to deploy processes that take our normal processing and delivery standards into account.\u201d DeJoy met with Schumer and Pelosi on Wednesday in a closed-door session that Schumer called \u201ca heated discussion.\u201d Democrats told DeJoy that \u201celections are sacred\u201d and urged him not to impose cutbacks \u201cat a time when all ballots count,\u201d Schumer said. In separate letters, two Montana Republicans, Sen. Steve Daines and Rep. Greg Gianforte, also urged the Postal Service to reverse the July directive, which eliminates overtime for hundreds of thousands of postal workers and mandates that mail be kept until the next day if distribution centers are running late. And 84 House members \u2014 including four Republicans \u2014 signed yet another letter blasting the changes and urging an immediate reversal. \u201cDelaying mail service is unacceptable,\u201d Gianforte wrote Thursday to DeJoy. \u201cDo not continue down this road.\u201d In their letter, the 84 House members said it is \u201cvital that the Postal Service does not reduce mail delivery hours, which could harm rural communities, seniors, small businesses and millions of Americans who rely on the mail for critical letters and packages.\u2019\u2019 The letter was led by Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., chairwoman of the House Oversight Committee, who has called DeJoy to testify at a hearing next month. The flurry of letters came as the top Democrat on a Senate panel that oversees the Postal Service launched an investigation into the operational changes. Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, the top Democrat on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said DeJoy has failed to provide answers about the service delays, despite repeated requests. Democrats have pushed for $10 billion for the Postal Service in talks with Republicans on a huge COVID-19 response bill. The figure is down from a $25 billion plan in a House-passed coronavirus measure. Key Republicans whose rural constituents are especially reliant on the post office support the idea. Trump, a vocal critic of the Postal Service, contended Wednesday that \u201cthe Post Office doesn\u2019t have enough time\u201d to handle a significant increase in mail-in ballots. \u201cI mean you\u2019re talking about millions of votes. .. It\u2019s a catastrophe waiting to happen.\u201d"}]}
