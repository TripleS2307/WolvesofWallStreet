MarketWatch/Kollmeyer Just hours ahead of the start of a long holiday weekend, the Spanish government put the Madrid region under a state of emergency on Friday, determined to stop an exodus of potentially infected residents. In past years, Monday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Hispanic Day holiday would have seen Spaniards clog highways and trains to reach their beach and countryside second homes. But surging coronavirus cases in the Madrid region, one of the worst infected in Spain, had the government scrambling to curtail those plans. Prime Minister Pedro S\u00c3\u00a1nchez\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leftist coalition government and Madrid\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right-wing premier Isabel D\u00c3\u00adaz Ayuso have been at loggerheads for weeks over how to combat the region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s climbing cases. A week ago, fresh restrictions were ordered by the central government for all areas of Spain that met certain criteria, which included Madrid. The rules limit residents to their region or municipality, except under certain situations, impose capacity restrictions and closure times for businesses of 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. for bars and restaurants. As well, no more than six people can gather either inside or outside at one time.

According to El Pa\u00c3\u00ads, which cited a government source, Ayuso refused to negotiate and the state of alarm went ahead for nine municipalities in the region, including the capital. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt this point, patience has a limit. None so blind as those who will not see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Salvador Illa, Spain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health minister, at a news conference on Friday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs a consequence, we have to take measures to protect the health of Madrilenos and avoid the situation spreading to other regions and put in danger the health of more people.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Illa added that it was \u00e2\u0080\u009cextremely important\u00e2\u0080\u009d that Madrid\u00e2\u0080\u0099s high infection rates not spread across the rest of Spain. The state of emergency will last for 15 days and S\u00c3\u00a1nchez can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t extend it without further support from the Congress of Deputies and the lower house of parliament, said El Pa\u00c3\u00ads. On Thursday, the government reported Spain had seen 256 positive cases per 100,000 people over the last 14 days, which was a slight improvement on the 269 reported a week ago. The Madrid region dropped from 647 to 563, and the harder-hit Navarra region fell to 655 from 692, respectively, data showed. Spain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s official death toll stands at 32,688. The World Health Organization said that there was a record one-day increase in global cases over the last 24 hours. Spain has thus far managed to avoid the national catastrophe of the spring, and so hospitals are not overrun and the death rate is far lower than earlier this year. The big difference this time for those under the state of emergency is that they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be confined to their homes such as in the spring, unless they are quarantining due to COVID-19. Still, many in the capital city are staying home or frequenting the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cafes and restaurants far less often, as jobless levels soar in the capital city long emptied of its mass of foreign visitors. #Despe\u00c3\u00b1aperros was trending on Twitter, in reference to a canyon in Andalusia.
