About a third of the closures are in California. The closures come after the Wall Street Journal reported last week that the company has laid off a number of workers in multiple states, as it struggles with the financial impact of gym closures due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Journal previously reported 24 Hour Fitness was seeking financing to stay afloat during a possible Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. Last week, the company said it hoped to have 50% of its locations back open by June. Prior to the closures, 24 Hour Fitness had more than 400 gyms in 14 states, with around 22,000 employees."}]}
