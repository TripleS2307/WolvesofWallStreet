But according to data released Tuesday, many savers are still financially on the path to retirement. The combination of a stronger market, pandemic-related stimulus opportunities and steady, disciplined investing in the second quarter, gave Fidelity Investments cause for optimism. The firm, which publishes its analyses on investors and employers\u2019 retirement trends every quarter, found double-digit increases in 401(k) plans and individual retirement accounts.

The average employer contribution in the second quarter of the year was $1,080 \u2014 something roughly three-quarters of workers received.

Nearly nine in 10 401(k) account holders (88%) were contributing to their accounts during the second quarter, which spanned April, May and June. Of those, 9% increased their contribution rates. Almost all (96%) of 403(b) account holders maintained or increased their contribution rates during the same months. The average 401(k) balance in the second quarter was $104,400, up 14% from the first quarter but down 2% from the same time last year. The average 403(b) account balance was $91,100, a 17% increase from the last quarter and also 3% up from the year before. The average individual retirement account was $111,500, a 13% increase from the first quarter and just slightly more than the average $110,400 the same time last year. Also see: Is Suze Orman right? Is a traditional IRA really the wrong way to invest for retirement? Millennials continued to favor Roth IRA accounts, which are funded with after-tax dollars but can be withdrawn tax-free. This generation made up 23% more IRA accounts in the second quarter of 2020. Roth IRAs specifically had a 36% year-over-year growth (with a 50% increase in contributions). Read: The Roth strategy we wish we\u2019d built for early retirement Not all retirement savers can be optimistic. The pandemic has put millions of Americans out of work, some of whom are close to retirement age and didn\u2019t have enough to retire yet. The CARES Act, passed in March, allowed savers to withdraw more than usual from their retirement accounts, though financial advisers urge consumers to think carefully before doing so."}]}
