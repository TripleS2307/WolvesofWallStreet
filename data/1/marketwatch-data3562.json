What\u2019s the latest medical news? Experts continued to weigh in on Russia\u2019s announcement Tuesday that it is registering the world\u2019s first COVID-19 vaccine, even though it has not yet commenced Phase 3 testing. Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Insitute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, told ABC News that having a vaccine, and having a safe and effective vaccine, are two different things. \u201cI hope that the Russians have actually, definitively proven that the vaccine is safe and effective,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cI seriously doubt that they\u2019ve done that.\u201d His comments echoed those of other experts expressing skepticism and alarm at the speed with which Russia has developed the vaccine and its plan to start dosing volunteers, including health care workers and teachers, in October. Russia has conducted just two trials of the vaccine, with a third planned after volunteers register. The normal approval process for a new medicine is to gather data from Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials, and then expand the patient base to thousands in a Phase 3 trial to create enough evidence it is effective and safe. \u201cThere are no Olympic medals for being first,\u201d said Dr. Matthew Schmidt, University of New Haven Associate Professor of National Security and Political Science and a Russia expert. \u201cCheating on the scientific process hurts the perception of vaccine safety everywhere. The goal isn\u2019t to be first, it\u2019s to be first in a way that gives people faith in a vaccine\u2019s safety,\u201d he said. In other medical news, Moderna Inc. MRNA, +0.09% agreed to sell at least 100 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate to the U.S. government for more than $1.5 billion. The vaccine is currently in a Phase 3 trial after earlier research found it produced antibodies.
