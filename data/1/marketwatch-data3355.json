On Sunday, however, Cook broke from his carefully prepared script and strongly pushed social issues, the latest corporate chieftain to weigh in, amid intensifying discussions about inequality in the U.S. and representation of Black Americans in technology-related enterprises. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do believe, optimistically, this is one of those moments that we could make significant progress,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cook said of a groundswell of calls for social justice in the wake of the killing of George Floyd while in police custody on May 25. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor so many things, it seems like there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s such slow progress, and then all of the sudden, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a giant leap.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ostensibly, Cook appeared on CBS Sunday Morning to promote the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Worldwide Developers Conference, which will take place virtually for the first time on Monday. But the 8-minute interview quickly turned into a discourse on racial inequity, rights for the gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and queer community, and challenges managing a $1.5 trillion tech behemoth in the age of COVID-19. Perhaps his most telling comments came when discussing the iPhone and its role in filming the murder of Floyd, a black man who died under the knee of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is white. Chauvin driving his knee into the neck of an unarmed Floyd for 8 minutes and 46 seconds until he perished, was captured on video and has helped to ignite a modern civil rights movement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSome of the most dramatic societal changes have occurred because someone captured video,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cook said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe thing that has changed though, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very proud of this, is that we put a camera in everybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pocket, and so it becomes much tougher as a society, I believe, to convince themselves that it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen, or that it happened in a different manner or whatever it might be.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Alabama native shared his first encounter with racism, which he remembered \u00e2\u0080\u009cas if it were yesterday.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It was seeing doors marked \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhites only,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and failing to understand \u00e2\u0080\u009chow people could convince themselves that this was right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cook, who is gay, later lauded the Supreme Court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision against job discrimination toward people based on gender or orientation. He said he is \u00e2\u0080\u009cincredibly grateful for their opinion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Amid the social protests, there is a raging pandemic and economic recession that has put the safety of Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AAPL, +1.74% \u00c2 137,000 employees squarely on his shoulders. The company is in the process of slowly onboarding workers at its vast Apple Park campus in Cupertino, Calif., after it temporarily closed some Apple Stores in Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Arizona because of COVID-19 spikes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe thing that I worry that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be missing is the serendipity that we all count on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cook said of the disconnect between a small number of employees returning to offices working with a vast majority working from home. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd for that reason I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wait until we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all back together.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs a general rule, very few people that thrive on uncertainty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cook said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the most important thing for us is, we viewed it as a challenge to overcome.\u00e2\u0080\u009d True to Apple form, Cook was evasive on what to expect from Monday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s keynote speech opening WWDC. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m full of secrets and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard not to overflow right now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he joked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been trained well.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stopped the rumor mill from speculating on what to expect at WWDC. The biggest? Apple may announce support for a new processor architecture for the Mac, ARM, in place of long-time part Intel Corp. INTC, -1.03% \u00c2 . The iPhone is due for iOS 14, which could include support for AirTag location trackers."}]}
