Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez laid out the progressive movement\u2019s goals in her speech to the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday without mentioning the name of Joe Biden, who was officially nominated by the party for president. The New York congresswoman symbolically nominated Sen. Bernie Sanders, and later tweeted her \u201cdeepest congratulations\u201d to Biden. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Ocasio-Cortez backed Sanders in the Democratic primary against Biden, and was critical of Biden as too centrist. She later joined a Biden-Sanders \u201cunity task force\u201d with the aim of defeating President Donald Trump. Yet gaps remained on key issues, with progressive ideas like the \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d and \u201cMedicare for All\u201d not making it into the task-force recommendations. In her speech she gave her thanks to \u201ca mass people\u2019s movement working to establish 21st-century social, economic, and human rights, including guaranteed health care, higher education, living wages, and labor rights for all people in the United States.\u201d \u201cIn a time when millions of people in the United States are looking for deep systemic solutions to our crises of mass evictions, unemployment, and lack of health care, and \u200besp\u00edritu del pueblo\u200b and out of a love for all people, I hereby second the nomination of Senator Bernard Sanders of Vermont for president of the United States of America,\u201d said Ocasio-Cortez. The move was procedural. As the congresswoman explained, convention rules require roll call and nominations for every candidate who passes the delegate threshold. Sanders spoke to the convention on Monday night, acknowledging differences with Biden including over health care, but making a strong case for him as president.

Trump is attempting to paint Biden as what he calls a \u201cTrojan Horse\u201d for the left \u2014 and negative for stocks \u2014 even as the former vice president has rejected certain progressive ideas.
