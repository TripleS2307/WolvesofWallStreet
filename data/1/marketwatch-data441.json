{"article": [{"url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/g4s-gardaworlds-announcement-was-misleading-2020-10-07", "published": 1602039260.0, "headline": "G4S: GardaWorld's announcement was misleading", "body": "G4S PLC said Wednesday that the announcement made by GardaWorld Security Corporation on Tuesday was misleading and designed to serve the interests of GardaWorld and BC Partners, rather than those of \"G4S's shareholders, customers, employees and pension fund members.\" The security-services company said GardaWorld's offer significantly undervalues G4S and its prospects. G4S said GardaWorld's focus on legacy issues \"which are now substantially resolved,\" and its misleading statements were designed to provide support for its \"opportunistic and clearly inadequate offer.\" \"GardaWorld clearly needs a transformative acquisition in order to realize its aspiration to be a global company and this is simply not reflected in its offer of 190 pence per share,\" G4S said. The board said it remains of the view that this offer significantly undervalues the company and its prospects. The company said that in addition to its strong financial performance in the first eight months of 2020, it has continued to underpin its future performance with contract wins and retained business with an annual contract value totaling 1.4 billion pounds ($1.80 billion) for the first six months. G4S said its pensions schemes are well funded and that it has already agreed a funding plan with the trustees. It said GardaWorld has yet to publish its funding plan for G4S's pension schemes, and that it may need to contribute a larger amount given its much higher leverage and subinvestment grade status. The company said \"that is an issue for GardaWorld, not G4S shareholders.\""}]}
