The company said the sales during the quarter, which marks the strongest quarterly booking activity since the COVID-19 outbreak in early 2020, are comprised of 19 existing and new customers. \"Much of our [agriculture, commercial and industrial] sales activity has been on-hold since March 2020 as new and existing customers faced challenges and uncertainty caused by COVID-19,\" said Chairman Chuck Cargile. \"The most notable volume of third quarter sales were booked in the last week of September, and we are optimistic this momentum will continue into the fourth quarter as we signed two more large projects in the first week of October.\" The stock has more than doubled (up 124%) year to date through Tuesday, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% has gained 4.0%."}]}
