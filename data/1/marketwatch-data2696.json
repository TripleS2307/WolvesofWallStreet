At least 17 million people have recovered. The U.S. has the highest tallies in the world with 6.08 million cases and 184,689 deaths. Health experts were alarmed by the news that the Trump administration will not work with an international efforts to develop and distribute a COVID-19 vaccine that is backed by the World Health Organization. Trump has repeatedly criticized the WHO for being pro-China and is pulling the U.S. out of the global agency. \"The United States will continue to engage our international partners to ensure we defeat this virus, but we will not be constrained by multilateral organizations influenced by the corrupt World Health Organization and China,\" said White House spokesman Judd Deere, as the Associated Press reported. Rep. Ami Bera, D-Calif., said the administration's decision was shortsighted and will hamper the battle to end the pandemic. \"Joining COVAX is a simple measure to guarantee U.S. access to a vaccine - no matter who develops it first,\" tweeted Bera, a medical doctor. \"This go-it-alone approach leaves America at risk of not getting a vaccine.\" Brazil is second to the U.S. with 3.9 million cases and 122,596 deaths. Brazil is followed in case numbers by India, Russia and Peru. By death toll, it is followed by India, Mexico and the U.K."}]}
