The move is aimed at supporting the flow of credit to large companies. The index will be composed of U.S. issuers, as long as they are not deposit-taking financial institutions. The purchases will also target bonds with maturities of 5 years or less. Issuers do not need to go through the certification process to prove they are eligible for the broad purchases, but if the Fed buys bonds of individual issuers, they will still need to certify themselves. The iShares $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond Fund LQD, +0.23% gained 1.6% after the news."}]}
