The recent resurgence of the buck has made dollar-backed gold relatively more expensive to overseas buyers using other monetary units. The dollar on Friday was climbing 0.3%, bringing its weekly rise to about 1.8% and on track for the sharpest such gain since April, as measured by the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, -0.58%, FactSet data show. The Federal Reserve\u2019s \u201cmonetary policy confusion has boosted the dollar index, and this increase in the dollar index has brought more weakness for the gold price,\u201d said Aslam. \u201cInvestors aren\u2019t fully satisfied with the notion that the Fed is going to keep the interest rate lower for three years, as some of the Fed\u2019s committee members believe that the interest rate can go higher\u201d before the Fed reaches its inflation target, he said. Against that backdrop, December gold GCZ20, +2.17% GC00, +2.17% fell $10.60, or 0.6%, to settle at $1,866.30 an ounce, sending the metal to its lowest finish in two months. It saw a 4.9% weekly drop\u2014the steepest for a most-active contract since the period ended March 13, according to FactSet data. \u201cThere may well be another bull run heading towards the gold price,\u201d Aslam. \u201cThere is little to no chance that the Fed will become hawkish in the short to medium term when it comes to their monetary policy. This should be positive for the gold price.\u201d The coronavirus spread also has worsened in Europe, and if there\u2019s a similar scenario in the U.S., that would \u201cadversely impact the U.S. stock market\u201d and may \u201cincrease the odds further of the gold price moving higher,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, the everyday economic numbers that we see for the U.S. economy have started to show a lot more weakness, said Aslam. Gold prices had briefly pared losses to trade off the session\u2019s lows in the wake of data Friday on August U.S. durable goods orders, which showed a rise of 0.4%. That was the fourth straight gain, but a more modest rise following three straight strong gains. Next, the chance for a second Congressional stimulus package, which the stock market has been craving, remains slim. This should also support the gold price.

Hence, we maintain our positive view on gold,\u201d the UBS analysts wrote. Meanwhile, December silver SIZ20, +5.96% SI00, +5.96% settled 10 cents, or 0.4%, lower at $23.093 an ounce, pushing it to its lowest settlement since late July. Gold\u2019s sister metal marked weekly decline of a 14.9%, its sharpest weekly drop since the week ended March 13. Among other metals traded on Comex, December copper HGZ20, +1.38% edged up by 0.1% to $2.971 a pound, with prices nearly 4.7% lower on the week. October platinum PLV20, +3.99% added 0.5% to $942 an ounce, losing over 10% for the week, while December palladium PAZ20, +2.31% fell 0.2% to $2,222.20 an ounce, for a weekly loss of around 6.7%."}]}
