As a result, thousands of workers have been laid off or furloughed (Photo by KAMIL KRZACZYNSKI/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images Jobless Americans in more than 22 states are now receiving an extra $300 a week in unemployment benefits under President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s executive order. But how much money people will ultimately get and how long the benefit will last depends on which state they live in. In some states, the payments will cover six weeks retroactive to Aug. 1, but for unemployed Americans in other states, that won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be in the case. Nine states \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Alabama, Arizona, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Texas and Utah\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have finished making the $300 payment to claimants for six weeks, as of Tuesday. Thirty-seven other states have been approved for six weeks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 worth of funds and some are in the process of distributing it. Then there are states like Florida and Idaho, which have informed unemployment beneficiaries that they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be receiving the enhanced benefit for six weeks. Arkansas and Wyoming are the only two states that are waiting to be approved by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which oversees the Lost Wage Assistance program, for six weeks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 worth of funds. But with just 6%, or $2.5 billion, of FEMA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s $44 billion chest remaining to make LWA payments to states, residents of those states may not receive the $300 for the entire six weeks. Why Floridians are getting four weeks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 worth of funds and not six On Sept. 14, Florida\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Department of Economic Opportunity said eligible Floridians will receive only four weeks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 worth of the additional $300 benefit. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because Florida is no longer eligible to hand out the extra $300, which is being funded by $44 billion in federal disaster relief funds. To qualify for the extra $300, unemployed workers must already receive at least $100 a month in state-level unemployment benefits. States can chip in this $100 themselves, or pay 25% of all of their weekly unemployment claims using state funds to make their residents eligible for the extra $300. But as of Aug. 29, only about 368,000 unemployment claims in Florida were state-funded. That amounts to19% of Florida\u00e2\u0080\u0099s total unemployment claims, First Coast News, a Florida news outlet, reported. States who met the 25% cost-sharing requirement or chipped in $100 extra, including Montana and Kentucky, were initially guaranteed at least three weeks of the $300 add-on benefit once approved by FEMA. Because unemployment beneficiaries are only eligible for the extra $300 if they receive at least $100 in state-level benefits, nearly 1 million Americans who receive less than $100 a week would be ineligible for the add-on benefit, Eliza Forsythe, a labor economist and assistant professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, calculated. But more recently, FEMA said that it will \u00e2\u0080\u009cmake grant awards to enable requesting states, territories and the District of Columbia to make $300 LWA supplemental wage payments to eligible claimants for a full six weeks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The percentage of Floridians receiving state unemployment benefits has continued to decline despite the significant number of new cases of coronavirus reported in the state. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not necessarily a sign of economic recovery. It is likely occurring because Floridians are only eligible for 12 weeks of state unemployment benefits, the shortest span of time among all 50 states. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFlorida\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historically low unemployment rate in 2019, pre COVID-19, set the number of weeks Floridians are eligible for state Reemployment Assistance in 2020,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Paige Landrum, a DEO spokesperson said in a statement to MarketWatch on Sept. 14. At the federal level, Floridians could still be eligible for unemployment benefits through CARES Act funded programs such as Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation or Pandemic Unemployment Assistance. But those payments won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t count towards the 25% states are required to pay in weekly unemployment claims to qualify for the $300 add-on benefit. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unclear whether that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also why Idaho is distributing the $300 for five weeks instead of six. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIdaho completed the Lost Wages Program and will not be paying a 6th week,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Craig Shaul, a spokesman at the Idaho Department of Labor, told MarketWatch. Shaul did not respond to multiple requests for comment regarding why the state won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be paying a sixth week. Related:\u00c2 The extra $600 in weekly unemployment benefits expired \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but gig workers and self-employed Americans still qualify for benefits At least 27 states haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t started paying the $300 weekly benefit In total, 49 states have been approved by FEMA to start making payments. South Dakota was the only state that did not apply.\u00c2 \u00c2 At least 22 states have either started or completed making the $300 payment to eligible claimants as of Sept. 24. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss: U.S. jobless claims are rising again \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and this state is a big reason for that Claimants in Alaska, which received FEMA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approval on Aug. 24, likely won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t receive the $300 benefit for another month due to computer reprogramming challenges, the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development said. However, the state has been approved for six weeks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 worth of funds from FEMA to make the retroactive payments. For a while, it seemed as though states that began administering the $300 add-on benefits quickest would have access to FEMA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s finite funds for a longer period of time than states like Alaska, said Michele Evermore, a policy expert at the National Employment Law Project, a nonprofit group that advocates for low-wage workers. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why \u00e2\u0080\u009cFEMA had to stop payment in some of the states that have been faster to pay benefits to make sure that the distribution of the benefits is equal across states,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Evermore said.\u00c2 That doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t appear to be case for residents of Arkansas and Wyoming given that the two states haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been approved for six weeks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 worth of funds. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have applied for all six available weeks of LWA funding, and we received approval for the first three weeks a few weeks ago,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ty Stockton, a spokesperson for Wyoming\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Department\u00c2 of Workforce Services, told MarketWatch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe received approval for Week 4 [on Wednesday], and we are still waiting to hear whether we will be approved for Week 5 and Week 6. We will\u00c2 begin paying qualifying claimants for Week 4 immediately.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Representatives from Arkansas\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Division of Workforce Services did not respond to a request for a comment.West Coast wildfires and other natural disasters aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t eating into LWA funds, FEMA says There are also concerns that FEMA funds intended for the LWA program payments are being used to help fight the wildfires raging across the West Coast, among other natural disasters, before all states have the opportunity to distribute six weeks of the $300 add-on benefit given. A FEMA spokesperson said that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the case. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFEMA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s funding of ongoing recovery projects from previous as well as new disasters has not been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the spokesperson told MarketWatch. \u201c Last month, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan think-tank, estimated that the FEMA funds weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sufficient to fund more than five weeks of LWA payments. \u201d Evermore is skeptical of that. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho knows how fast it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll wind down,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, referring to the FEMA fund. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith all the wildfires it seems like a big promise to make,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Evermore said, referring to funding six weeks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 worth of the $300 benefit for 49 states.\u00c2 The looming question: What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next? As for what nearly 30 million unemployed Americans could expect after the FEMA funds are exhausted, absent of any Congressional or executive actions, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go back to receiving pre-pandemic amounts of unemployment benefits. In six states, the maximum amount of unemployment benefits one can collect equates to less than the $7.25 an hour federal minimum wage, CNBC reported. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m terrified that Congress ignores this and then there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another wave of COVID and layoffs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Evermore said. That could prove to be the case given that senators\u00e2\u0080\u0099 time in the coming weeks will likely be occupied by confirmation hearings for the next Supreme Court justice to fill Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seat. Trump tweeted TWTR, -0.23% on Tuesday that he will be announcing his nomination on Saturday."}]}
