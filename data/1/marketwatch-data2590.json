It now says it is \"reviewing its relations\" with the country. - Russian President Vladimir Putin, a Lukashenko ally, said last week in a meeting between the two men that Moscow would extend a $1.5 billion loan to its cash-strapped neighbor, after indicating earlier that a Russian police force was ready to help the regime if protests got out of control. - European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen cautioned a week ago in her \"state of the union\" address to the European Parliament that \"those that advocate closer ties with Russia\" are wrong. \"The poisoning of Alexei Navalny with an advanced chemical agent is not a one off. We have seen the pattern in Georgia and Ukraine, Syria and Salisbury - and in election meddling around the world. This pattern is not changing - and no pipeline will change that,\" she said.

Lukashenko's unapologetic, if secret, self-swearing-in has given an indication that he is not ready to engage with other governments to try to find a solution to the current crisis. For now, his election rival, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, is urging the EU to direct its funds directly to those in Belarus who need them most - like doctors and hospitals. And despite his protestation of support, Putin so far doesn't seem eager to send troops to Belarus, as he did in Ukraine in 2014. Risks that Germany might pull out of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline that von der Leyen alluded to may partly explain his reticence.
