It now says it is \u00e2\u0080\u009creviewing its relations\u00e2\u0080\u009d with the country. - Russian President Vladimir Putin, a Lukashenko ally, said last week in a meeting between the two men that Moscow would extend a $1.5 billion loan to its cash-strapped neighbor, after indicating earlier that a Russian police force was ready to help the regime if protests got out of control. - European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen cautioned a week ago in her \u00e2\u0080\u009cstate of the union\u00e2\u0080\u009d address to the European Parliament that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthose that advocate closer ties with Russia\u00e2\u0080\u009d are wrong. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe poisoning of Alexei Navalny with an advanced chemical agent is not a one off. We have seen the pattern in Georgia and Ukraine, Syria and Salisbury \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and in election meddling around the world. This pattern is not changing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and no pipeline will change that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. Read: EU offers \u00e2\u0080\u0098new trans-Atlantic agenda\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to the U.S., whoever is next president The outlook: The EU is opening a new front in its worsening relationship with Putin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Russia. Lukashenko\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unapologetic, if secret, self-swearing-in has given an indication that he is not ready to engage with other governments to try to find a solution to the current crisis. For now, his election rival, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, is urging the EU to direct its funds directly to those in Belarus who need them most \u00e2\u0080\u0094 like doctors and hospitals. And despite his protestation of support, Putin so far doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem eager to send troops to Belarus, as he did in Ukraine in 2014. Risks that Germany might pull out of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline that von der Leyen alluded to may partly explain his reticence.
