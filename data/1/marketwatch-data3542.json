But the increase in food prices was a bit extreme when compared with the latest consumer inflation data. \u201cFood at home\u201d costs have gone up 5.6% on a yearly basis, according to government data released on Tuesday. That\u2019s the highest jump since 2011. Read:Higher gas, food prices trigger first increase in consumer inflation in four months U.S. online grocery sales rose 9% month-over-month in June, reaching $7.2 billion, according to the Brick Meets Click/Mercatus Grocery Survey. That survey found that the June sales increase corresponded with increased concern about contracting coronavirus and as more food retailers offered the option for grocery pickup after ordering online. See:The meat industry will be completely gone in 15 years, Impossible Foods CEO says \u201cThis increase in online grocery capacity has flipped the equation,\u201d said David Bishop, partner and research lead at Brick Meets Click. \u201cToday as shoppers have more choice, the increased capacity is now actually enabling the continued growth of online grocery.\u201d The number of coronavirus cases in the U.S. has reached 3.3 million with Florida counting a record of more than 15,000 new cases on Sunday. The U.S. death toll is more than 135,000. Some state legislators and public health officials have called for stay-at-home orders as the number of cases surge. Overall, Adobe found that e-commerce spending was $77 billion higher than expected while inflation has driven digital purchasing power (DPP) into negative territory for the first time ever, \u201cwhich means consumers can now purchase goods online for $1.01 that would have cost $1.00 in June 2019,\u201d Adobe said. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF XRT, +0.05% is down 5.6% for the year to date. The Invesco Dynamic Food and Beverage ETF PBJ, +1.66% is down 8.3%. And the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% has slipped 2.2% for the period. \u201cOnline grocery orders for delivery or curbside collection have grown significantly and we expect online penetration to grow structurally,\u201d Fitch Ratings wrote in a report about global corporate recovery from coronavirus. Read:Grocery prices are rising as eat-at-home demand soars during the pandemic \u201cSome weaker regional companies with limited investment capacity may be unable to support robust omnichannel models and will lose share to better-capitalized companies.\u201d Adobe notes that grocery cart size has fallen due to a decline in stockpiling and rising online grocery prices after skyrocketing 33% in mid-February . Even if shoppers aren\u2019t pantry-loading any longer, food manufacturers have discussed the struggle to keep up with demand. Campbell Soup Co.\u2019s CPB, +0.10% Chief Executive Mark Clouse addressed what he\u2019s seeing in consumer demand as the pandemic progresses in the U.S. during third-quarter earnings call in June. For example, the company saw a 140% increase in demand for ready-to-eat soup, which had a significant impact on manufacturing. There\u2019s also been an increase in cooking from scratch, with Clouse saying that risotto made with tomato soup is a \u201cvery, very high demand recipe.\u201d And customers are trying new products, which is hopefully accompanied by a positive response. \u201cSo the other work that we need to be doing right now is to really understand that optimal assortment and making sure that inventory remains kind of balanced with where demand\u2019s going to come from, that we\u2019re selective and thoughtful about what that assortment looks like, while making room for innovation that we still believe is going to be important,\u201d Clouse said, according to a FactSet transcript. See:We have plenty of food, so why are grocery store shelves so empty? Clouse says customers might not see the same number of promotions going forward, something that other food producers, like Conagra Brands Inc. CAG, +0.18% noted as well. Also:Meat shortage looms as coronavirus shuts packing plants leaving farmers with tough choices Conagra, on its June 30 call, highlighted the \u201crobust demand\u201d for frozen vegetables. \u201cGiven the incredible surge in demand we experienced during the fourth quarter and our number one brand position, we hit a ceiling on capacity,\u201d said Sean Connolly, chief executive of Conagra, according to a FactSet transcript. Despite the challenges, shoppers don\u2019t have to worry about a widespread lack of food. \u201cThere is limited supply-chain risk in this sector, other than some shortages (such as beef) in key food categories,\u201d Fitch Ratings said."}]}
