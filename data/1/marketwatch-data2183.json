The move was geared to \u00e2\u0080\u009cmake stock ownership more accessible to employees and investors,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the company said. Tesla TSLA, +1.89% \u00c2 shares have more than tripled so far this year.

The split is a recognition that the market \u00e2\u0080\u009cis increasingly influenced by individual investors, including those looking to gain exposure to next-generation transportation trends,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Baird analyst Ben Kallo wrote in a note Wednesday. Tesla shares rallied in the extended session Tuesday and in the premarket on Wednesday. That \u00e2\u0080\u009cstrength is indicative of investors electing to purchase stocks which are positioned to benefit from the current upgrade cycle for technology around transportation, renewable energy, and the software enabling both,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kallo said. For Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, Tesla is following Apple Inc.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AAPL, +1.74% \u00c2 lead \u00e2\u0080\u009cand ultimately we expect more tech giants to potentially head down this path over the coming months as the parabolic rally in tech/EV names over the past five months has put companies in a position of strength to make such moves,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said in a note. The split was \u00e2\u0080\u009ca smart strategic move at the right time\u00e2\u0080\u009d for Tesla given its strong retail base and \u00e2\u0080\u009cgrowing appetite\u00e2\u0080\u009d among investors for Tesla, and, more broadly, for the electric-vehicle industry, Ives said. Tesla shares have gained 255% this year, compared with gains around 5% for the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87%, and are up 550% in the past 12 months, compared with a 17% advance for the S&P in the same period.

Tesla twice this year surprised investors with a quarterly profit when Wall Street called for a loss; its second-quarter earnings, its fourth consecutive quarter of GAAP profit, put it on track to join the S&P 500. The inclusion, expected to happen within a few months, would unleash a torrent of new money from countless exchange-traded funds, and be followed by pension, mutual and other actively managed funds in the U.S. and overseas, that track the large-cap benchmark or have size or other restrictions on which stocks to add to their holdings. Besides Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s profitability, several analysts have praised Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cash reserves, the continued strong demand for its electric vehicles, its new factories being built in Texas and in Germany, and a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbattery day\u00e2\u0080\u009d scheduled for Sept. 22 as well as the expected launch of the Cybertruck, its electric pickup."}]}
