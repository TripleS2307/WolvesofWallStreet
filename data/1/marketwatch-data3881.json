Capri Holdings CPRI, +2.55% , the parent company to Versace, Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo, saw sales drop to $451 million in the fiscal first quarter versus $1.35 billion last year. Michael Kors sales fell 68.7% to $307 million. Capri reported earnings early Wednesday. Ralph Lauren RL, -0.59% said Tuesday that sales for its fiscal first quarter fell to $487.5 million from $1.43 billion last year. Capri stock climbed 12.5% in Wednesday trading while Ralph Lauren stock was up 2.8%. Read: Ann Taylor joins other retailers that have recently filed for bankruptcy. Here are a few things they have in common \u201cWith the results from both Capri and Ralph Lauren out, a clear pattern is emerging: The pandemic has deteriorated demand for apparel and accessories across the board, but nowhere more so than in the luxury sector,\u201d wrote Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData Retail. Capri\u2019s core customers haven\u2019t suffered financially as much as some others during the pandemic, Saunders said. However, their interests have turned elsewhere. \u201cLarge numbers of people elected to divert spending from clothing to other priorities such as homewares, groceries and electronics,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cWith its fashion-focused portfolio, this put Capri at a disadvantage.\u201d Capri\u2019s Chief Executive John Idol also talked about the impact that the dramatic travel declines have had on his company. \u201c[A]ll of our regions have been impacted as international travel has virtually come to a standstill since the outbreak of COVID-19,\u201d he said on the earnings call, according to FactSet. \u201cTourism and travel-related sales comprise a meaningful part of our business. Tourist activity impacts our travel retail.\u201d iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Saunders thinks Ralph Lauren\u2019s exposure to department stores and other parts of the wholesale channel is a challenge for the brand. But it, too, is selling goods that people aren\u2019t looking for at the moment. \u201cRalph Lauren is more exposed to the occasion part of the apparel market than many mainstream retailers,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cAs social events and activities have ground to a halt, so too has purchasing. The same dynamic also holds true for more formal products which are purchased for work.\u201d See:Target talks Christmas in July with holiday announcement Cowen analysts lowered their price target on Ralph Lauren shares to $61 from $78, but maintained its market perform stock rating. \u201cGiven the brand\u2019s significant exposure to the challenged North American wholesale channel, albeit reduced from prior years, we think further footprint distribution rationalization is likely to occur for the brand,\u201d wrote analysts led by John Kernan. \u201cRevenue recapture may not be linear even with the shift to digital and improved CRM [customer relations management] capabilities.\u201d Rural lifestyle specialty chain Tractor Supply Co. TSCO, +0.47% , do-it-yourself home goods retailer Lowe\u2019s Cos. Inc. LOW, +1.38% and athletic goods retailer Hibbett Sports Inc. HIBB, +8.39% have been among the shops that consumers have been flocking to amid the pandemic. Also on the list are grocers like Kroger Co. KR, +0.46% , Walmart Inc. WMT, +1.00% and Target Corp. TGT, +1.14% . Don\u2019t miss:Amazon is making gains with older consumers as more people turn to e-commerce during COVID-19 But GlobalData\u2019s Saunders also points out that Capri and Ralph Lauren face hurdles that pre-date the coronavirus. \u201cLooking beyond the pandemic, when Capri does emerge it will not only have to fix the financial damage but also tackle issues with some of its brands \u2014 particularly Michael Kors,\u201d he said. \u201cEven before the crisis, performance was not where it should be because of a lack of clarity in ranges and brand messages.\u201d And Ralph Lauren must continue its turnaround efforts. \u201cRalph Lauren cannot be blamed for the terrible numbers,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cHowever, as consumer preferences shift, the company needs to work harder to reinvent itself and to pivot into new channels and segments to secure growth.\u201d Ralph Lauren stock has fallen 44.3% for the year to date while Capri shares are down 60.6% for the period. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% has risen 3.6% for 2020 to date."}]}
