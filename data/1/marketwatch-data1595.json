GILD, +0.82% gained 2.0% in premarket trading on Friday after the drugmaker disclosed findings from a new analysis of previously disclosed clinical trial data that found the experimental therapy remdesivir can reduce the risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients by 62%, when compared to the standard of care. Gilead said the mortality data point is \"an important finding that requires confirmation in prospective clinical trials.\" The new analysis is not from a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial; it stems from a comparative, pre-planned analysis of 312 severely ill participants in a randomized, open-label Phase 3 trial and a real-world retrospective cohort of 818 patients with COVID-19 who had similar clinical attributes to those included in the trial and received remdesivir as part of their treatment. The new analysis may also help reinforce previous conclusions from a randomized, placebo-controlled National Institutes of Health trial that found remdesivir can reduce recovery times, a finding that was published in April and contributed to the Food and Drug Administration's decision in May to grant an emergency use authorization to remdesivir. Gilead's stock has gained 14.9% year-to-date, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% is down 2.4%."}]}
