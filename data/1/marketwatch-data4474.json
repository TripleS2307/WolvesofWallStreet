The Stoxx Europe 600 index SXXP, +0.55% fell 0.3% in choppy trade to 359.11, after a modestly higher close on Tuesday. The index logged a 12.5% gain for the second quarter, the best percentage gain since the first quarter of 2015.

The German DAX DAX, +0.06% fell 1%, with the French CAC 40 PX1, +0.71% down 0.7% each and the FTSE 100 UKX, +0.64% fell 0.5%. \u201cGoing into the third quarter, the markets face more uncertainty. There is the potential for a new wave of coronavirus to emerge, even though the first wave is far from over given the situations in the U.S. and Latin America,\u201d said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Think Markets, in a note to clients. \u201cStock investors will find out exactly how the lockdown hit company profits, with the second-quarter reporting season soon to kick off.

Elsewhere, the final eurozone manufacturing purchasing manager index (PMI) rose to 47.4 in June, from a previous estimate of 46.9 and a May level of 39.4. The data add further to signs that \u201cthe eurozone factories are seeing a strong initial recovery as the economy lifts from COVID-19 lockdowns,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS, in a press release. Sentiment also rebounded sharply, but Williamson said production and sentiment remain below pre-pandemic peaks, and weak demand and social distancing will keep dragging on the recovery. And Italy and Spain\u2019s economies, while improving, still came in below the key 50.0 level that indicates expansion. The Caixin China manufacturing PMI climbed to a six-month high of 51.2 in June from 50.7 in May.
