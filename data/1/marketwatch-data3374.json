Those concerns were fueled by the news that the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has sent a letter to governors, urging them to prepare to start distributing a COVID-19 vaccine in their states by Nov. 1, just two days before the election. In the letter dated Aug. 27, CDC head Robert Redfield said states \u201cin the near future\u201d will receive permit applications from drug distributor McKesson Corp. MCK, -1.75%, which has contracted with CDC to distribute vaccines to places including state and local health departments and hospitals, as the Associated Press reported. \u201cCDC urgently requests your assistance in expediting applications for these distribution facilities and, if necessary, asks that you consider waiving requirements that would prevent these facilities from becoming fully operational by November 1, 2020,\u201d Redfield wrote. The Redfield letter was first reported on by McClatchy. Public health experts pointed out that final-stage trials of experimental vaccines are still recruiting, and are at best halfway through that process. The vaccines consist of two doses, given a month apart. Experts told the AP they did not understand how there could be adequate data on whether the vaccines work and are safe before Nov. 1. \u201cBeing ready is reasonable. Cutting short Phase 3 trials before you get the information you need isn\u2019t,\u201d said Dr. Paul Offit, a Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia immunization expert who sits on the FDA\u2019s vaccine advisory committee. Dr. Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, said he was concerned about an \u201cOctober surprise\u201d with a vaccine being rushed through ahead of the election. \u201cThe public health community wants a safe and effective vaccine as much as anybody could want it,\u201d Osterholm said. \u201cBut the data have to be clear and compelling.\u201d Moncef Slaoui, a venture capital investor and former GlaxoSmithKline PLC executive who heads up the government\u2019s Operation Warp Speed program, told NPR he cannot imagine trials producing data before the end of October. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Meanwhile, the State Department told Congress it is diverting funds owed to the World Health Organization this month, the Guardian reported. Trump issued a notice of withdrawal from the world\u2019s leading public health agency in July, but the move does not take effect until next July. In the meantime, the U.S. is on the hook for $65 million in membership dues. In other news: \u2022 A group of 22 economists from leading universities has sent an open letter to U.S. policy makers urging them to \u201cstart over and do it right\u201d to contain the virus. \u201cOur nation\u2019s economy will remain in crisis as long as the COVID-19 virus spreads unchecked,\u201d reads the open letter, which is being distributed by U.S. PIRG, the federation of state Public Interest Research Groups, a consumer advocacy group. \u201cAs experts on economic theory and practice, we have come together to insist that you reconsider your understanding of the economic reality we face.\u201d Reopening bars, gyms and restaurants is \u201cprolonging the harm,\u201d they wrote, and driving up disease and deaths. The letter warns that people\u2019s economic lives will be kept on hold for a long time, if the virus is not contained. Signatories include James Galbraith of the University of Texas at Austin, Martin Ravallion of Georgetown University, Jerry Green of Harvard University, Donald Davis of Columbia University, Amalia Miller of the University of Virginia, Francine D. Blau of Cornell University, and Debraj Ray of New York University. \u2022 France counted 7,017 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday, up from 4,982 on Tuesday, marking the third time since the onset of the pandemic that it has counted more than 7,000 infections in a single day, according to local media. \u201cThe virus keeps spreading in the country,\u201d French health authorities said in a statement. About a fifth of France\u2019s administrative districts are suffering from an \u201cactive circulation of the disease,\u201d they said. The number of French people hospitalized stood at 4,632, well below the peak of 32,292 seen in April but worrying to experts after rising for more than five straight days. France has 331,060 confirmed cases of the virus, and 30,692 people have died, according to Johns Hopkins data. \u2022 A Minnesota biker who attended the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in South Dakota in August has died of COVID-19, the Washington Post reported, marking the first fatality linked to an event that drew more than 400,000 people. The man was in his 60s, and had underlying medical conditions, the paper said; he was hospitalized after returning from the rally. At least 260 cases in 11 states have been linked to the event, the paper said, based on a survey of health departments. Participants were filmed crowding bars and sidewalks, while failing to socially distance or wear face masks. Experts say the number of cases stemming from the event is likely understated, because many of the attendees are unwilling to be tested and the states they live in have limited contact tracing. \u2022 Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson and his family tested positive for the coronavirus. Johnson announced their diagnoses in an 11-plus-minute video on Instagram on Wednesday. He said he was shocked after hearing their test results, calling the ordeal \u201cone of the most challenging and difficult things we\u2019ve ever had to endure.\u201d Johnson said the illness has made him more conscious. He made several suggestions to combat the virus, such as wearing a mask, boosting immune systems and committing to wellness.Latest tallies There are now 26.1 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins data, and 864,691 people have died. At least 17.3 million people are confirmed to have tested positive and recovered. The U.S. has the highest case tally at 6.1 million, and the highest death toll at 186,185. The U.S. mortality rate stands at 56.77 per 100,000 people. Brazil is second to the U.S. with 3.9 million cases and 123,780 deaths. See: \u2018We can\u2019t let our guard down\u2019: Scientists say some children could spread COVID-19 even if they have antibodies Brazil is followed in case numbers by India, Russia and Peru. India has the third highest death toll at 67,376, followed by Mexico with 65,816. The U.K. has 342,684 cases and 41,615 deaths, the highest in Europe and fifth highest in the world. China, where the disease was first reported late last year, has 89,961 cases and 4,727 deaths, according to its official numbers. What\u2019s the latest medical news? Sanofi SA SAN, +1.20% SNY, +0.89% and GlaxoSmithKline PLC GSK, +1.10% GSK, +1.52% said their COVID-19 vaccine candidate has entered a Phase 1/2 clinical trial, MarketWatch\u2019s Jaimy Lee reported. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study plans to enroll 440 healthy participants in the U.S., and the companies said they plan to move their experimental vaccine into Phase 3 trials by the end of the year based on the vaccine\u2019s performance in the earlier phases of development. The vaccine has received funding from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority. Novavax Inc. NVAX, +0.18% released more data on its Phase 1 trial of a vaccine for COVID-19 Wednesday, and shares rose about 4% in after-hours trading. Novavax previously released findings from the study that said the vaccine candidate induced immune responses and was well-tolerated, but more data from the study was published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.

New applications for unemployment benefits fell sharply last week to a fresh pandemic low, but the entire decline stemmed from a major change in how the data are reported instead of more people finding jobs, MarketWatch\u2019s Jeffry Bartash reported. The labor market showed no progress absent the change. Initial jobless claims fell by 130,000 to a seasonally adjusted 881,000 in the last week of August, the Labor Department said Thursday. These figures reflect applications filed the traditional way through state unemployment offices. Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast 940,000 new unemployment claims in the seven days ended Aug. 29. Yet not all of their estimates took into account the change in the government\u2019s formula for seasonal adjustments. See also:Did the expired $600 federal jobless benefit keep people from going back to work? Sudden drop in claims adds fuel to debate The Bureau of Labor Statistics said last week it would alter its adjustment process to make the report more accurate. The level of seasonally adjusted new claims has run notably higher than the real or actual number of people applying for benefits each week, a problem that became more pronounced in the past month. The new method began with this week\u2019s report. The BLS does not plan to revise previous data to reflect its new statistical approach. For a fuller explanation:The government is making a big change in how it reports jobless claims \u2014 and here\u2019s why The unadjusted or real number of new jobless claims, meanwhile, suggest there was barely any change last week in how many people are applying for benefits. They rose slightly to 833,352 from 825,761. It was the fifth straight week in which unadjusted claims have been below 1 million. By any measure, though, jobless claims are still exceedingly high. They ran in the low 200,000s and stood near a half-century low shortly before the coronavirus epidemic broke out. \u201cThe data show that layoffs remain widespread and the recovery in the labor market is occurring at a frustratingly slow pace,\u201d said lead U.S. economist Nancy Vanden Houten of Oxford Economics. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% was last down 133 points, while the S&P SPX, +0.87% was down 1.2%.What are companies saying? \u2022 AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. AMC, -2.17% will start reopening its movie theaters in New Jersey on Sept. 4, after the sixth largest state in the movie theater chain\u2019s circuit announced the reopenings will be permitted. AMC said it will start by opening two theaters \u2014 AMC Jersey Gardens 20 and AMC Wayne 14 \u2014 on Friday, and expects to have all 27 of its New Jersey theaters open on or around Sept. 10. \u2022 Arconic Corp. ARNC, +3.32% restored the salaries and 401(k) match for all of its U.S. salaried employees, including executives on Sept. 1, after cutting them earlier this year to counter the impact of the pandemic. The maker of aluminum parts for airplanes and cars said the move will not affect its plan to cut costs by $100 million and cut capex by $50 million. \u201cThese salary and benefit reductions represented approximately one third of the Company\u2019s temporary cash savings on an annualized run rate,\u201d the company said in a regulatory filing. \u2022 Campbell Soup Co. CPB, +0.10%, the canned soup, snacks and simple meals company reported fiscal fourth-quarter profit and sales that topped forecasts, buoyed by at-home dining trends during the pandemic. Meals & beverages sales rose 28% to $1.02 billion, above the FactSet consensus of $960.3 million, and snacks sales grew 11% to $1.09 billion to top expectations of $1.08 billion. For the fiscal first quarter, the company expects adjusted EPS of 88 cents to 92 cents, surrounding the FactSet consensus of 89 cents, and sales to rise 5% to 7%, while the current FactSet consensus of $2.29 billion implies 4.9% growth. \u2022 Ciena Corp. CIEN, +1.53%, the networking systems and software company, reported fiscal third-quarter results that beat expectations but said an orders slowdown related to the COVID-19 pandemic would hurt revenue for \u201ca few quarters.\u201d Revenue rose 1.7% to $976.7 million, topping the FactSet consensus of $972.8 million. Total networking revenue rose 0.8% to $802.3 million, above the FactSet consensus of $794.0 million, and total global services revenue was flat at $116.7 million to miss expectations of $124.1 million. Software and services revenue totaled $57.7 million, up from $47.8 million a year ago, but below expectations of $62.8 million. \u2022 Conn\u2019s Inc. CONN, +2.21% posted a surprise profit for its fiscal second quarter, as the furniture and home appliances retailer saw strong online demand during the pandemic. E-commerce sales rose 72% from a year ago, as shoppers moved online during the pandemic. Same-store sales fell 13.2%, mostly due to changes in underwriting in the company\u2019s credit department, and supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic. \u2022 Designer Brands Inc. shares DBI, -1.28% plummeted, after the parent of the DSW Designer Shoe Warehouse retail chain reported a wider-than-expected fiscal second-quarter loss as sales fell more than forecast despite \u201caggressive\u201d promotional activity, as the pandemic continued to affect store traffic. Sales dropped 43% to $489.7 million, missing the FactSet consensus of $589.6 million, as same-store sales fell 42.7% versus expectations of a 26.5% decline. Gross margin as a percentage of sales fell to 7.6% from 30.5%. \u201cThe decrease in gross profit was primarily driven by the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak on our operations resulting in the temporary closure of stores and, subsequently, significantly reduced customer traffic upon store re-openings, which we addressed with aggressive promotional activity,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u2022 Discount-store chain Five Below Inc. FIVE, +2.50% reported second-quarter revenue that beat Wall Street estimates as stores reopened after being closed temporarily during the pandemic. Five Below declined to give a forecast for its fiscal third quarter or its current year due to the coronavirus. The company expects to open 110 to 120 net new stores in 2020. \u201cWe feel good about our positioning for the second half of the year,\u201d Chief Executive Joel Anderson said in a statement about the results. \u2022 Arts and crafts retailer Michaels Cos. Inc. MIK, -1.95% blew past estimates for the second quarter as stores reopened after being closed during the pandemic. Same-store sales rose 12%, compared with a FactSet consensus for a decline of 5.9%. The company said all its stores had reopened by the beginning of July, though e-commerce sales remained strong and were up more than 350% from a year ago. The company ended with quarter with $1.3 billion in liquidity. It is not offering guidance, because of the uncertainty created by the pandemic. \u2022 Signet Jewelers Ltd. SIG, -0.38% reported a much narrower-than-expected loss and revenue that topped forecasts, although same-store sales missed. Same-store sales declined 31.3% to miss expectations of a 28.9% decline. \u201cWhile same-store sales were down 31.3% in the quarter given store closures, same-store sales turned positive in late Q2 as we reached scale on store re-openings while driving high double-digit growth in e-commerce,\u201d said Chief Executive Virginia Drosos. \u201cMomentum has continued into Q3 with preliminary August same-store sales of 10.9% and e-commerce growth of 65.2%.\u201d The company increased the target savings from its cost-cutting efforts to $285 million from $225 million. \u2022 Tyson Foods Inc. TSN, -1.71% will open seven health clinics near its facilities for employees and their families. The clinics, which will be operated by Marathon Health, a privately held provider of worksite health clinics, are expected to open in 2021. Employers are facing rising costs of health care services provided to their employees, and in recent years several large companies including Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.74% and Amazon Inc. AMZN, +3.01% have announced plans to set up health clinics for their workers. In July Tyson announced that it will create the company\u2019s first chief medical officer role. It also outlined a COVID-19 testing strategy that requires it to test thousands of workers for the virus following several coronavirus outbreaks among its workers this summer."}]}
