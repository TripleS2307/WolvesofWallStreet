Getty Images Joe Biden on Monday attacked President Donald Trump as having sparked recent violence, in a speech that comes as swing-state polls show the Democratic challenger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lead is eroding in the White House race. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFires are burning, and we have a president who fans the flames, rather than fighting the flames,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Biden said during a speech in Pittsburgh. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop the violence, because for years he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fomented it. He may believe mouthing the words \u00e2\u0080\u0098law and order\u00e2\u0080\u0099 makes him strong, but his failure to call on his own supporters to stop acting as an armed militia in this country shows how weak he is.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s address in the swing state of Pennsylvania occurred as polls focused on battleground states show the former vice president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advantage over Trump declining. In a RealClearPolitics average of polls as of Monday, the Democratic nominee is leading the Republican incumbent by 2.7 percentage points in top battleground states that are likely to decide the November election, down from his 6.3-point edge a month ago. Betting markets give Biden just a 51% chance of winning, down from 61%, according to a separate RCP average. Ahead of Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s speech, the Trump campaign made a counterattack. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBiden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coming out of his basement today and traveling to Pittsburgh to pretend that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spoken out against violence all along and cast blame of President Trump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a senior adviser to Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign, Jason Miller, told reporters on a conference call on Monday morning. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the fact is President Trump has been the one who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been stopping the violence the whole time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Real Clear Politics Biden and other Democrats on Sunday accused Trump of trying to inflame racial tensions to benefit his campaign as the president praised supporters who clashed with protesters in Portland, Ore., where one man had just died, and announced he will travel to Kenosha, Wis., amid anger over the shooting of another Black man by police. Trump is slated to go to Kenosha on Tuesday, and then make his own trip to Pennsylvania on Thursday, as he campaigns in Latrobe. In his Pennsylvania speech on Monday, Biden also said he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d \u00e2\u0080\u009cbe looking to lower the temperature in this country, not raise it. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be looking to unite the nation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In addition, the former vice president talked up his economic plans, saying his energy XLE strategy \u00e2\u0080\u009chas a place for the energy workers right here in western Pennsylvania\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that he is \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot banning fracking, no matter how many times Donald Trump lies about me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% on Monday were trading mostly lower on August\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last session, but staying on track to notch monthly gains of 7% or more."}]}
