TSLA, +1.89% will report second-quarter results after market close on July 22, the company said Thursday. A call with analysts will follow at 5:30 p.m. Eastern. Analysts polled by FactSet expect Tesla to report an adjusted loss of 58 cents a share on sales of $4.8 billion, which would compare with an adjusted loss of $1.12 a share on sales of $6.4 billion for the same period in 2019, the most recent quarter of losses for Tesla as the company went on to post GAAP and adjusted earnings for the three quarters that followed. Tesla shares fell slightly on Thursday after a $1,389.86 record close on Tuesday. The company earlier this month reported better-than-expected second-quarter deliveries despite having its sole U.S. car-making factory shuttered for most of the quarter due to shutdowns designed to curb the spread of the coronavirus."}]}
