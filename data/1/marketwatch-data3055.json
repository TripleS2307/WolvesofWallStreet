Adobe ADBE, +2.30% shares closed up 4.9% at $406.54, just short of its record high closing price of $406.82 set on Wednesday, after rising as much as 6% to an all-time high of $411.72. The company released earnings late Thursday, reporting record annual recurring revenue (ARR), a software-as-a-service metric that shows how much revenue the company can expect based on subscriptions for digital media of $9.17 billion. Of the 28 analysts who cover Adobe, 19 have buy or overweight ratings, eight have hold ratings, and one has an underweight rating. Of those, 15 analysts hiked their price target, resulting in an average price target of $414.44, up from a previous average of $365.65, according to FactSet data. JPMorgan analyst Sterling Auty, who has an overweight rating and raised his price target to $430 from $325, said that investors were willing to overlook revenue that came in light for the quarter as they were \u201cprepared for worse.\u201d What really mattered, Auty said, were the ARR numbers. \u201cThe beat in ARR and durability of Creative Cloud is likely to be well received by investors, as will the impressive margins and upside in EPS,\u201d Auty noted. That Adobe pulled its guidance for the year did not matter much as many of companies he covers have done the same given the uncertainty created by COVID-19, he said. J. Derrick Wood, who has a market perform rating and raised his price target to $400 from $365, characterized the quarter as \u201cmixed.\u201d While he was impressed with ARR and the work-from-home benefits, the company\u2019s third-quarter outlook suggests \u201cthere are still macro pressures at hand.\u201d Adobe forecast third-quarter adjusted earnings of about $2.40 a share on revenue of about $3.15 billion, when analysts had been forecasting earnings of $2.46 a share on revenue of $3.26 billion. By Friday, the Wall Street consensus was $2.41 a share for earnings and $3.16 billion for revenue, according to FactSet data. Jefferies analyst Brent Thill, who has a buy rating and raised his price target to $470 from $450, likened Adobe\u2019s management to \u201chighly experienced pilots, flying deftly around pockets of turbulence.\u201d As millions work from home and shelter in place as result of the coronavirus pandemic, Adobe software \u201cis proving critical for online content, paperless workflows, and digital customer experiences (incl. e-commerce),\u201d Thill said, adding that he\u2019s confident about Adobe\u2019s \u201cmarket leadership and superior fundamentals.\u201d Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives, who has a neutral rating and raised his price target to $410 from $315, said Adobe delivered \u201can ARR Masterpiece.\u201d \u201cAs we have seen from other tech stalwarts during earnings season, Adobe continued the trend as the strong get stronger with the company\u2019s Creative and Digital product footprint seeing no signs of slowing down,\u201d Ives said. \u201cThe subscription and sticky element of the company\u2019s product portfolio on both the consumer and enterprise front are key strengths enabling Adobe to show the Street that its business model can withstand this unprecedented backdrop without skipping a beat,\u201d Ives said Adobe shares are up 23% for the year, contrasting with a 6% decline in the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% and compared with a 7% rise in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.39% and a nearly 14% increase in the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF IGV, +1.85%."}]}
