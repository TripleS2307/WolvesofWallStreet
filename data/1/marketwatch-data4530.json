That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the message from Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, chief investment officer of private wealth management at Goldman Sachs, who thinks that gold is overpriced and has no clear role in the portfolios of her private clients. Our view is that gold is only appropriate if you have a very strong view that the U.S. dollar is going to be debased. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have that view. We think the dollar maintains its status as the reserve currency. The dollar can cheapen a little bit because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s moderately overvalued but that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be debased, that we are going to have huge inflation and that gold is a good substitute. During an interview on CNBC Thursday morning, Mossavar-Rahmani explained that her wealth management group has two factors that it focuses on when thinking about gold: strategically and tactically. She said that gold isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a great deflation hedge, doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t generate any income, and isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tied to economic growth and corporate earnings, so it fails the strategic hurdle as Goldman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wealth management crew assesses its relevance in a balanced portfolio. Secondly, she explained that tactically, gold is a hard case to make unless investors hold the perception that the current bout of weakness in the U.S. dollar is the start of a more severe downturn for dollars and a possible change in leadership of the monetary unit that is viewed as the No. 1 reserve currency in the world. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo all this excitement and brouhaha about gold is not something that we buy into,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mossavar-Rahmani said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn fact, at one point, we think people should look at the reverse and think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more downside to gold,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. Mossavar-Rahmani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments run in contrast with Goldman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commodity crew, which earlier this week raised its 12-month forecast for gold to $2,300 from $2,000 . That shift was precipitated by \u00e2\u0080\u009ca potential shift in the U.S. Fed toward an inflationary bias against a backdrop of rising geopolitical tensions, elevated U.S. domestic political and social uncertainty, and a growing second wave of COVID-19 related infections,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a team of analysts including Jeffrey Currie. On Thursday, August gold GOLD, +2.86% fell by $11.10, or 0.6%, to settle at $1,942.30 an ounce, after settling at a record on Wednesday, marking its ninth straight advance, which is its longest win streak since a 10-session climb ended in January. Gold\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ascent has come amid the backdrop of rising cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. and around the world. However, gold\u00e2\u0080\u0099s climb has also coincided with a weakening of the dollar against its major rivals, which can give gold buoyancy because bullion and other precious metals are priced in the currency and its softening can make metals more attractive to buyers using alternative currencies. One measure of the buck, the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, -0.58% was down around its lowest level since 2018 and has dropped 4.5% so far in July, according to FactSet data, while gold has climbed 8.1%, based on the most-active contract."}]}
