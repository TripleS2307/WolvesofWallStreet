The city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s signature features are closed for the foreseeable future, putting much of the economy on hold, and making how long it will be until tourists return a multibillion-dollar question. And just as New York seems to have finally gotten a handle on coronavirus cases, infection rates have exploded in dozens of states, effectively dashing hopes of returning to anything resembling the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s usually lucrative tourism trade any time soon. Indoor dining that was supposed to come as part of Phase 3 has been put on hold indefinitely, and Gov. Andrew Cuomo recently imposed a 14-day quarantine on visitors from 19 states including California, Texas and Florida.\u00c2 In 2019, tourism was a $70 billion industry that brought a record 67 million visitors to New York City. But as far as when the city might be able to safely start welcoming back visitors, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a big question mark,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Andrew Rigie, executive director of the New York City Hospitality Alliance. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWithout knowing when [tourists are] going to come back, it creates even more uncertainty for small-business owners.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Read: 5 myths about wearing masks Experts have estimated that as many as 25,000, or 20%, of the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel rooms may not return after the pandemic, indicating that the current crisis could have longer-ranging effects on the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s volume of visitors. In lieu of making plans that are contingent on tourism, bars, restaurants, and venues are instead turning their attention toward creatively drumming up business from locals for the foreseeable future. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWorldwide tourism will be back, but right now the main focus of bars and restaurants is serving their local regulars and attracting \u00e2\u0080\u0098tourists\u00e2\u0080\u0099 from other parts of town,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ariel Palitz, senior executive director of New York City\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Office of Nightlife. But even city residents will be limited in their options as \u00e2\u0080\u009ctourists,\u00e2\u0080\u009d unable to take in shows at Lincoln Center, Brooklyn Cyclones games in Coney Island, or exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, all of which remain closed. And though expanded outdoor dining and the ability to legally deliver alcoholic drinks have helped some bars and restaurants reopen to brisk business, in an industry known for slim margins, those measures may not be enough to keep businesses afloat during an indefinite tourism drought.\u00c2 Also see: Under proposed plan, NYC students to attend in-person classes two or three times a week in September \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no way small-business owners will be able to pay multiple months of missed rent, or even pay their pre-pandemic rents when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re reopened but at a limited capacity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rigie said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to continue to need support from the federal, city and state governments to sustain these businesses so they can fully recover when the time comes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d While theaters and venues remain closed, the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entertainment industry is exploring options for moving summer events outdoors or in spaces that allow for adequate social distancing. Late last month, the Tribeca Film Festival announced plans to host a series of drive-in movies this summer at Orchard Beach in the Bronx. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting a ton of those inquiries,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Anne Del Castillo, commissioner of New York City Mayor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Office of Media and Entertainment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re coordinating to really look holistically at public space throughout the city and develop opportunities for organizations to collaborate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Accommodating local residents is a priority, as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s getting increasingly unclear how long it will take for tourists to return. Current travel restrictions apply to any state with an infection rate higher than 10%, which means that more than 150 million Americans are technically barred from visiting New York City without undergoing a two-week self-quarantine upon arrival. Instead of asking how to accommodate tourists, the going question for public officials right now is how to properly enforce restrictions on so many of them. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe first part [of recovery] is getting the workforce back in the entertainment, media and nightlife sectors,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Del Castillo said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe second part is getting New Yorkers to come back out to enjoy those offerings. And that builds momentum for tourism \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 to come back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Read more: Even with reopening, New York still faces a future that looks very different But having seen what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happened with hasty reopenings in other states, which have experienced near-immediate spikes in cases and abruptly closed back down, even owners of businesses that depend the most on tourism are approaching the issue with caution. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe feedback from various sectors is that they appreciate\u00e2\u0080\u009d the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s staggered reopening plans, Del Castillo said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey see what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening in other jurisdictions and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want that to happen here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}]}
