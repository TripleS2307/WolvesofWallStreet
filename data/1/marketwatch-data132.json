Davidson about Morgan Stanley\u2019s deal to acquire Eaton Vance and loan-loss provisioning activity.) Bank stocks typically drop during recessions. This time around, with the big players well-capitalized, largely free from the worst of loan loss set-asides and benefitting from a rebounding economy, investors may be looking at an opportunity staring them in the face. And the biggest banks have clear advantages: fees from investment banking and asset management. (Below are tables showing expected and historical provisions for loan losses, non-interest income, earnings per share and analysts\u2019 ratings for the largest dozen U.S. banks.)The hot space \u2014 asset management Morgan Stanley MS, -0.34% has been making moves to become a premier asset manager. On Thursday, the firm said it would acquire Eaton Vance Corp. EV, -0.56% for $7 billion in cash and stock. Eaton Vance had $507 billion in assents under management as of July 31, and Morgan Stanley said the merger would bring assets under management for its Morgan Stanley Investment Management unit to $1.2 trillion. Just on Oct. 2, Morgan Stanley completed its acquisition of discount broker E-Trade Financial. At that time, the bank said the firm\u2019s total assets under management (AUM) had risen to $3.3 trillion. That makes for a pro forma total of $3.8 trillion in AUM, assuming the Eaton Vance acquisition is completed following regulatory approval. A Twitter posting from Stephanie Link of HighTower Advisors underlined how hot the asset management business is: iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Maybe this shouldn\u2019t be a surprise, considering the asset bubble fueled by the Federal Reserve\u2019s nearly $3 trillion increase in the money supply (M2) this year. David Konrad, a managing director and senior research analyst at D.A. Davidson, sees Morgan Stanley\u2019s moves as \u201clowering the risk of the franchise\u201d and improving its return on equity. \u201cIt allows them to better leverage capital\u201d that would otherwise be locked up by regulators\u2019 temporary restrictions against dividend increases and share buybacks, Konrad said in an interview Thursday. He said the Eaton Vance portion of Morgan Stanley\u2019s combined asset-management business will be relatively safe from pressure on fees than competing firms because Eaton Vance \u201chas a lot of customized individual retail accounts.\u201d\u2018We recommend buying the Morgans\u2019 Even before Morgan Stanley\u2019s latest asset-management splash, Konrad wrote in a report on Oct. 6: \u201cWe recommend buying the Morgans.\u201d His \u201ctop idea\u201d is Morgan Stanley because of its mix of businesses, strong level of capital and the addition of E-Trade. He wrote that J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, -0.57% \u201cshould regain its multiple\u201d because of increasing revenue, lower credit costs after a brutal first and second quarters, and \u201cincreased visibility on its dividend.\u201d Konrad prefers JPM to Bank of America Corp. BAC, +0.47% as a long-term investment because it \u201coffers better fee-income growth through market-share gains in capital markets,\u201d and because of higher returns on capital and a more attractive valuation to the shares when considering its greater returns. Konrad has neutral ratings on BAC and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, -0.21%, while rating Citigroup Inc. C, +0.47% a \u201cbuy,\u201d despite investors\u2019 frustrations with the stock, in part because \u201cboth Citi and JPM have meaningfully higher reserve to loan ratios than BAC.\u201d You can see in the last table below that sell-side analysts as a group have the highest percentage of \u201cbuy\u201d ratings for Citigroup and expect its stock to increase the most over the next year among the 12 listed here.Provisions and reserve coverage A bank\u2019s quarterly provision for loan-loss reserves is the amount it adds to loss reserves to cover expected losses on loans and leases. Yes, it is moving money from one bucket to another, but it directly lowers earnings. Here\u2019s a summary of consensus estimates for third-quarter provisions among analysts polled by FactSet, compared with actual provisions over the past four quarters, for the largest 12 U.S. banks. The figures are in billions, and you will need to scroll the tables in this article to see all the data: Bank Ticker Estimated provision for loan loss reserves - Q3 2020 Provision for loan loss reserves - Q2 2020 Provision for loan loss reserves - Q1 2020 Provision for loan loss reserves Q4 2019 Provision for loan loss reserves Q3 2019 Total assets - June 30, 2020 J.P.

STT, +2.20% $18 $52 $36 $3 $2 $280,242 Source: FactSet During a year of economic turmoil, quarter-to-quarter comparisons can be more important than year-over-year comparisons. So the table includes both, and you can see analysts expect the third-quarter reserve set-asides to be much less painful than they were during the first half of 2020. In his own bank earnings preview report for clients, Odeon Capital Group analyst Richard Bove called third-quarter provisions \u201cthe most critical of any number produced in the quarter.\u201d He expects \u201ca relatively good set of numbers,\u201d but warned that negative surprises would cause meaningful declines for the stocks, even from their current discounted valuations. Bove cited a decline in commercial and industrial loans and \u201cmoderate growth elsewhere\u201d as among the reasons provisions would decline, but also wrote that \u201cit is beginning to appear that the banks may have over-reserved in the first half.\u201d Banks look ahead when setting aside reserves. It takes time for a loan to go through past-due cycles and be written-off. This means that third-quarter charge-offs will rise from the second quarter. But again, looking ahead, investors\u2019 reaction to this bit of bad news may be mitigated by the lower reserve builds. Konrad said on Thursday that he expected the largest banks\u2019 provisions for loan losses to be \u201cdown materially,\u201d with loan charge-off activity \u201cpretty steady,\u201d on the consumer side, although commercial charge-offs could be \u201clumpy.\u201dNoninterest income Interest income is pressured this year because of the Federal Reserve\u2019s bond-buying, which has pushed down long-term interest rates. Ten-year U.S. Treasury notes TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.777% yield a paltry 0.77%, down from an already low 1.92% at the end of 2019. For Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and J.P. Morgan Chase, a spike of bond issuance during the first quarter caused an increase in investment-banking income. For the three banks, third-quarter non-interest income is expected to decline sequentially but still be elevated from a year earlier. The figures are in billions: Bank Ticker Estimated non-interest income - Q3 2020 Non-interest income - Q2 2020 Non-interest income - Q1 2020 Non-interest income - Q4 2019 Non-interest income - Q3 2019 J.P.

Those quarterly comparisons will be much more important than blind comparisons with the year-earlier figures. Brian Kleinhanzl, managing director for large-cap banks at KBW, expects third-quarter earnings per share for the nine largest U.S. banks to be down 16% from a year earlier, but wrote that year-over-year declines have \u201cslowed form the prior quarter.\u201d He expressed caution, rating the group \u201cequal weight,\u201d as \u201cnear-term risks outweigh the long-term benefits that should emerge when the global economy recovers more meaningfully,\u201d he wrote in a report Oct. 1.Ratings and price targets Here are ratings summaries and consensus price targets among analysts polled by FactSet for the 12 largest U.S. banks.
