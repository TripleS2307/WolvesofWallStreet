The consultants, many with Republican Party ties, billed taxpayers up to $380 per hour on work largely aimed at polishing the profile of Medicare administrator Seema Verma, the investigators wrote. One contractor, Pam Stevens, who\u2019s done extensive work for the GOP, charged up to $330 hourly to pursue ideas like asking publications including Oprah Magazine and Garden & Gun to write articles about Verma. Stevens also seemed to bill at least $1,117 to arrange an interview that resulted in a Verma profile in AARP The Magazine, the report said. The contractors were \u201chandpicked\u201d by Verma\u2019s aides, the report said, creating \u201ca shadow operation\u201d that sidelined the communications staff of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The consultants\u2019 work often had nothing to do with running Medicare, Medicaid and other massive health programs that the agency operates, said the 56-page report, which was backed by over 1,700 pages of documents. Verma has run the agency since 2017. \u201cCongress did not intend for Administrator Verma or other senior CMS officials to use taxpayer dollars to stockpile CMS with handpicked consultants or promote Administrator Verma\u2019s public profile and personal brand,\u201d the report said. \u201cGiven the reckless disregard she has shown for the public\u2019s trust, Administrator Verma should reimburse the taxpayers for these inappropriate expenditures,\u201d it said. A Health and Human Services Department official called the report a \u201cpolitical smear\u201d by \u201cfar left politicians.\u201d The statement by Michael Caputo, the department\u2019s assistant secretary for public affairs, did not deny any of the report\u2019s specific findings. \u201cThis is just another reckless, politically timed, drive-by hit job on a reform-driven Trump Administration official and, by extension, on President Trump himself,\u201d said Caputo, who announced on Wednesday he was taking a leave of absence after he publicly accused government scientists of prolonging the coronavirus crisis to harm Trump in the November election and seemed to suggest Trump backers make plans for armed insurrection. Caputo said Verma \u201cwill continue the Administration\u2019s unprecedented success transforming the American healthcare system.\u201d See:House Democrats to probe whether officials meddled with CDC coronavirus data The report released Thursday was prepared by the Democratic staffs of two Senate and two House committees. The inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services, of which Verma\u2019s agency is a part, issued similar findings in July. Thursday\u2019s report said that besides burnishing Verma\u2019s image, the consultants took the lead fashioning agency communications strategies and had access to sensitive internal information that could affect financial markets. Marcus Barlow, a consultant who\u2019d previously worked for Verma at a firm in Indiana, billed the Medicare agency for hours comparable to those of full-time workers and had decision-making powers over some federal workers, the report said. Consultants arranged for private meetings between Verma and hosts of conservative Fox News and editors of Woman\u2019s Day and Women\u2019s Health Magazine, the investigators wrote. One memo suggested seeking to land Verma on Washingtonian magazine\u2019s list of Washington\u2019s most powerful women. Another document indicated contractors billed at least $13,000 to offer Verma\u2019s name for awards and to participate in other events. There was also an entry for nearly $3,000 for a \u201cGirl\u2019s Night to honor the Administrator,\u201d held at the home of Susan Page, USA Today\u2019s Washington bureau chief. Page wasn\u2019t aware that Verma\u2019s agency was billed for the event, and personally paid more than $4,000 for its costs without reimbursement, USA Today said in a statement. The news organization said the Girl\u2019s Night events have been held for years, with journalists honoring politicians of both parties. The report said Verma brought consultants with her on official travel, even when government aides were there, driving up taxpayers\u2019s costs. In one instance, Verma took a three-day trip to California, accompanied by three agency aides plus four consultants who charged up to $310 hourly for some of that time. Verma worked on health issues under Vice President Mike Pence when he was Indiana governor. She clashed with Democrats as part of President Donald Trump\u2019s team when he unsuccessfully tried repealing former President Barack Obama\u2019s health-care law."}]}
