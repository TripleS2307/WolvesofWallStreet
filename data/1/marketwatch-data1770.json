Investors largely ignored a mixed batch of economic reports, including a private-sector jobs reading that came in weaker than expected, suggesting only a slow recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. How did the benchmarks perform? The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% surged 454.84 points, or 1.6%, ending at 29,100.50, or 1.5% away from its Feb. 12 closing high of 29,551.42. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% climbed 54.19 points, or 1.5%, to settle at a record 3,580.84, its 22nd record close this year. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.39% advanced 116.78 points to close at a record 12,056.44, a gain of 1%, and its 43rd record close of the year. On Tuesday, the Dow rose 215.61 points to end at 28,645.66, or 0.8% higher, the S&P 500 index added 26.34 points to close at a record 3,526.65, a gain of 0.8%, after setting an intraday record of 3,528.03; while the Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 165.21 points to a record 11,939.67 finish, a rise of 1.1%, after touching a new intraday all-time high of 11,945.72.What drove the market? Stock markets finished at fresh records Wednesday, with a number of possible catalysts boosting the investing mood amid the coronavirus pandemic. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin restarted talks with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi about another fiscal stimulus plan to help out-of-work Americans, although Pelosi said the two sides still have \u201cserious differences,\u201d following their brief phone call Tuesday. On the health front, leading infectious disease health expert Dr. Anthony Fauci told NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show that a COVID-19 pandemic cure could come by the end of 2020, if the roster of companies attempting to achieve a vaccine are able to produce outstanding preliminary results. Speaking to Kaiser Health News on Tuesday, Fauci said the board overseeing vaccine approvals could decide that \u201cthe data is so good right now that you can say it\u2019s safe and effective.\u201d The global tally for confirmed cases of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 climbed to near 26 million on Wednesday, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University, while the death toll rose to 858,661. Buying continued in large-capitalization technology stocks and shares tied to pandemic stay-at-home trends, but also in shares of makers of consumer goods and autos. Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +2.48%, Facebook Inc. FB, +0.26% , Intel Corp. INTC, -1.03% and Walmart Inc. WMT, +1.00% shares punched higher, as did those of Coca-Cola Co KO, +0.69%, Ford Motor Co. F, -1.36% and General Motors Co. GM, -0.15%. \u201cThe unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus, not only in the U.S., but around the world, is going to provide the economy with a bridge,\u201d said Chris Armbruster, a portfolio manager at Kayne Anderson Rudnick in Los Angeles, giving investors reason to look beyond recently depressed economic data and high unemployment, to what lies ahead. In that vein, the U.S. government also will end up running its biggest budget shortfall ever this year, at $3.311 trillion, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday. Still, Armbruster sees many companies forced by the pandemic to adopt technologies and make improvements to their supply chains as likely to \u201cgrow and recover faster, and realize better margins.\u201d Stocks advanced despite a rash of mixed economic data. Automatic Data Processing Inc ADP, +1.93% data showing 428,000 private-sector jobs were created in August, missing expectations for a gain of 900,000 jobs, according to a consensus of estimates surveyed by Econoday. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty substantial miss, but still much better than what we saw last month,\u201d said Mike Loewengart, managing director investment strategy at E-Trade Financial, via email. ADP did, however, raise last month\u2019s jobs figure to 212,000 for July from a rise of 167,000, which was then below forecast of 1.9 million jobs. The economy has recouped fewer than half of the 20-million-plus jobs lost in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. Separately, U.S. factory orders rose 6.4% in July for a third straight increase, reflecting a rebound in manufacturing after the economy reopened. Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast a 6.2% gain. The Federal Reserve\u2019s Beige Book survey also showed the U.S. economy expanded modestly in August, but with many parts of the country experiencing slower growth during the pandemic, including as some companies make temporary layoffs permanent. In other news, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention late Tuesday implemented a temporary eviction moratorium through the end of the year, protecting millions of U.S. renters from losing their homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. \u201cCertainly, the real estate sector continues to be one that very few investors think will emerge in good shape,\u201d said Cameron Brandt, director of research at EPFR, in an interview with MarketWatch. However, Brandt also sees improvements in the cards for a broader base of stocks, beyond the stay-at-home winners and technology giants, as the general population becomes more comfortable with the idea that COVID-19 can be a managed risk. \u201cPeople want to get on with their lives,\u201d he said, adding that basic restocking, differed consumption and other factors that go along with reopening \u201cwill provide modest surprises to the upside.\u201d Which stocks were in focus? Shares of Macy\u2019s Inc. M, -0.95% rose 0.6% Wednesday, after the department store chain reported a fiscal second-quarter loss that was much narrower than expected as net sales topped forecasts.
