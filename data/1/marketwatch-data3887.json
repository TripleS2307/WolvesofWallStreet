The administration cast the effort as a way to free up jobs in an economy reeling from the coronavirus. A senior official who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity predicted it will open up to 525,000 jobs for Americans. The ban, while temporary, would amount to major restructuring of legal immigration if made permanent, a goal that had eluded the administration before the pandemic. Long-term changes that would prevent many asylum seekers from getting work permits and would allocate high-tech worker visas differently are also being sought. Business groups pressed hard to limit the changes, but got little of what they wanted, marking a victory for immigration hardliners as Trump seeks to further solidify their support ahead of the November election. The ban on new visas applies to H-1B visas, which are widely used by major American and Indian technology company workers and their families, H-2B visas for nonagricultural seasonal workers, J-1 visas for cultural exchanges and L-1 visas for managers and other key employees of multinational corporations. There will be exemptions for food processing workers, which make up about 15% of H-2B visas, the official said. Health care workers assisting with the coronavirus fight will continue to be spared from the green-card freeze, though their exemption will be narrower. \u201cIn the administration of our Nation\u2019s immigration system, we must remain mindful of the impact of foreign workers on the United States labor market, particularly in the current extraordinary environment of high domestic unemployment and depressed demand for labor,\u201d Trump wrote in his presidential proclamation. Trump imposed a 60-day ban on green cards issued abroad in April, which was set to expire Monday. That announcement, which largely targeted family members, drew a surprisingly chilly reception from immigration hardliners, who said the president didn\u2019t go far enough. The new steps to include non-immigrant visas went a long toward appeasing hardliners. \u201cThis is a bold move by the Trump administration to protect American jobs,\u201d said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for restrictions. \u201cNot all the items on our checklist of needed actions are included in today\u2019s announcement, but the corporate lobbyists who were desperately fighting for exceptions to protect their clients\u2019 access to cheap foreign labor have largely been rebuffed.\u201d Thomas J. Donohue, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s chief executive officer, said the measures will harm, not help, the American economy. \u201cPutting up a \u2018not welcome\u2019 sign for engineers, executives, IT experts, doctors, nurses and other workers won\u2019t help our country, it will hold us back,\u201d he said. \u201cRestrictive changes to our nation\u2019s immigration system will push investment and economic activity abroad, slow growth, and reduce job creation.\u201d BSA, a group that represents major software companies, urged the administration to reconsider, particularly changes to the H-1B program, saying they will hinder economic recovery by making it harder to fill critical positions. \u201cFilling these roles that are more abundant than the number of U.S. employees qualified to fill them means these jobs can be kept in the U.S.,\u201d the group said. \u201cThis allows companies based in the U.S. to remain globally competitive, which in turn boosts the U.S. economy, creating jobs for millions of Americans.\u201d The freezes on visas issued abroad are designed to take effect immediately. Other changes, including restrictions on work permits for asylum seekers, will go through a formal rule-making process that takes months. The administration is proposing a new way of awarding H-1B visas, the official said, awarding them by highest salary instead of by lottery. H-1B visas are capped at 85,000 a year for people with \u201chighly specialized knowledge\u201d and minimum of a bachelor\u2019s degree, often in science, technology, engineering, teaching and accounting. Critics say high-tech companies have used the visas as a tool to outsource jobs to foreigners, replacing Americans. Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. was the largest H-1B employer in the 2018 fiscal year, followed by Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., Infosys Ltd., Deloitte Consulting LLP and Microsoft Corp. Other major employers include Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Google and Facebook Inc. The rule against asylum seekers, scheduled to take effect Aug. 25, would make it much more difficult for them to get work permits by, among other things, lengthening the waiting time to apply from 150 days to a year and barring applicants who cross the border illegally. The 328-page regulation \u2014 signed by Chad Mizelle, the Homeland Security Department\u2019s acting general counsel, who is considered an ally of White House adviser Stephen Miller \u2014 says limiting work permits will remove a major incentive for people to come to the United States for asylum. It is the latest in a long string of measures that make asylum more difficult to get \u2014 almost unattainable, according to some immigrant advocacy groups. \u201cThe rule will prevent many refugees from feeding, supporting, and housing themselves and their families,\u201d said Eleanor Acer, Human Rights First\u2019s senior director for refugee protection. \u201cAsylum seekers and their families already struggle to survive under existing work authorization wait times. But this rule will make survival impossible for many.\u201d ___ Spagat reported from San Diego."}]}
