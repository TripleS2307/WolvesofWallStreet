The news that Trump and First Lady Melania Trump tested positive for Covid 19 \"creates a new round of market uncertainty and reinforcing fears of a second wave of the virus, which will harm the economy and projected energy demand,\" said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at The Price Futures Group, in a Friday note. \"Broader implications of the diagnose for energy, not only for the short term but for the long-term, cannot be understated. \" West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery CLX20, -1.62% tumbled $1.67, or 4.3%, to settle at $37.05 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest finish since Sept. 8, according to Dow Jones Market Data. December Brent crude futures BRNZ20, -0.07% slid 4.1%, or $1.66, to $39.27 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe, settling at the lowest front-month contract price since June 12. Based on the front-month contracts, WTI futures lost about 8% and Brent futures declined by 7.4% for the week. \"Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately,\" Trump said on Twitter. \"The news throws uncertainty into the immediate future of both the incumbent's election campaign and potentially the U.S. leadership,\" said analysts at the JBC Energy Research Centre, in a note to clients. Oil prices had logged their lowest settlement since mid-September on Thursday, driven by fears that COVID-19 cases will drive demand lower, even as U.S. supply tightens up. The Energy Information Administration on Wednesday reported a surprise fall of 2 million barrels in U.S. crude supply, the third straight weekly decline. Still, data from Baker Hughes BKR, -1.34% Friday showed the number of active U.S. rigs drilling for oil rose by 6 to 189 this week, marking as second straight weekly rise and implying an upcoming rise in output. The crude market was already breaking down \"before the announcement of the president's COVID diagnosis,\" said Marshall Steeves, energy markets analyst at IHS Markit. \"Fears around demand growth through the 4th quarter have undermined market sentiment.\" Investors in oil markets have been keeping close watch on the disease's expansion, which has worsened in parts of Europe, because it has a direct effect on the commodity if economies begin to slow down. \"The main reason for the latest surge in demand is that people are using their own vehicles rather than public transport for fear of catching coronavirus, which puts a number of question marks over the recovery,\" said Eugen Weinberg, head of commodity research at Commerzbank, in a note to clients.
