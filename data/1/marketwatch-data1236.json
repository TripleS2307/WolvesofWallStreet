Instead, the client compressed the installment sale into a one-shot transaction this month. What accelerated the deal? The 2020 presidential race. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAssuming all else was equal, that was the driver of the choice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hoppe, principal of the accounting firm Why Blu. Right now, Hoppe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s client, worth between $10 million and $20 million, will be taxed on capital gains at a rate of 23.8%. If Democratic candidate Joe Biden beats President Donald Trump \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and Democrats retain the House of Representatives and flip the Senate \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that client could have potentially been staring at a 39.6% tax rate in two out of the installment sale\u00e2\u0080\u0099s three years. The compressed transaction, then, could have saved the client approximately $320,000 in taxes on the $6 million sale. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe seller, for sure, was motivated, and the buyer had the wherewithal\u00e2\u0080\u009d to pay the full price upfront, said Hoppe. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tax plan would put the marginal rate for top earners back at the Obama-era 39.6% rate, up from the current 37% rate. That 39.6% rate would apply to the capital gains of people who earn more than $1 million. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one aspect of a tax proposal where the top 1% of earners would pay for almost 80% of an increase in taxes, according to a budget model from the University of Pennsylvania\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Wharton School of Business. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss:Possible payroll-tax cuts and lowering rates on long-term capital gains \u00e2\u0080\u0094 what a win for Donald Trump could mean for your taxes Election Day is eight weeks away, and the mass of expected mail-in ballots could prolong the wait for a final result, with many states not beginning to count absentee votes till the polls close. Though polling averages in swing states currently give Biden an edge over President Donald Trump, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s held a steady lead in national polls for most of the year, polls indicated right up till Election Day in November 2016 that Hillary Clinton would best Trump. Either way, though, many of America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s affluent households, and the experts who advise them, aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t waiting. Hoppe finishes every client conversation with a discussion about what a Biden administration could mean for portfolios vs. a second Trump term. One Illinois financial-planning firm has carried out approximately 50 Roth IRA conversions this year with an eye on the election. \u201c One adviser\u00e2\u0080\u0099s left-leaning clients don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think a Biden win will negatively affect their finances, but the adviser\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right-leaning ones think a Biden win could send their portfolio to \u00e2\u0080\u0098hell in a hand basket.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d In Houston, Scott Bishop, executive vice president at STA Wealth Management, has fielded election-related calls and emails from half his clients in the past two months. Bishop\u00e2\u0080\u0099s liberal-leaning clients want to hear about potential opportunities and tend to downplay the idea of new tax rules upending their finances. As for Bishop\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conservative-leaning clients, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey think this is going to hell in a hand basket\u00e2\u0080\u009d and want to get ready to quickly lock in rates and minimize tax exposure if Biden wins. Bishop \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who recalls talking down one client who wanted to \u00e2\u0080\u009csell everything\u00e2\u0080\u009d when Trump won in 2016 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 counsels everyone to think things through. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI try to get them to not act on their biases,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told MarketWatch.

Biden says his tax plan would make sure corporations and wealthy Americans pay their \u00e2\u0080\u009cfair share.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098We are working in the boundaries that are given to us.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Scott Hoppe, Why Blu Is it unfair that wealthier Americans are availing themselves of tax rules that work to their advantage? \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are working in the boundaries that are given to us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hoppe said, echoing a point numerous sources made to MarketWatch. Tax rules are written to discourage or encourage all sorts of activity, he said \u00e2\u0080\u0094 like a lower capital-gains rate to promote financial investments. When lawmakers \u00e2\u0080\u009cwant to change our behavior, the code evolves.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Biden campaign couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be reached for comment. Below, a description of three ways affluent Americans are taking the tax-planning bull by the horns weeks ahead of the election. Estate planning Americans will inherit $765 billion this year in gifts and bequests, and that sum will generate $16 billion in taxes, according to New York University Law School professor Lily Batchelder, who says that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s barely a 2% effective tax rate. The Republicans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 tax overhaul of late 2017 elevated the threshold at which the 40% federal gift and estate exemption phases out. Starting in 2018, the exemption level went from $5.45 million to $11.4 million for individuals ($22.8 million for married couples), and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s indexed for inflation. The provision ends in 2025, but observers say Biden wants to end it a lot sooner and bring the estate tax back to its \u00e2\u0080\u009chistorical norm.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Biden also wants to end the so-called step-up in basis. This tax rule states that if an heir sells an inherited asset (like 7,000 shares of Apple AAPL, +1.74% ) capital-gains taxation on any future sale is pegged to an asset\u00e2\u0080\u0099s value at the time of inheritance, not the date of the original purchase. If an asset appreciates greatly over time, the step-up in basis saves an heir plenty in capital gains. Michael Whitty, a partner specializing in estate law at Freeborn & Peters in Chicago, is telling his clients to schedule one-hour calls with him now to game out election contingency plans. How much to give away and what to give away are some of the topics, he said. Whitty wants to have the talks sooner rather than later \u00e2\u0080\u0094 especially in light of the fact that lawmakers in the past have been known to make new estate-tax rates retroactive. \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098The client who waits until after Election Day, and some will wait until towards Thanksgiving, well, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be really behind the eight ball to put together a well-prepared, well-documented transfer.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Michael Whitty, Freeborn & Peters \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe client who waits until after Election Day \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and some will wait until towards Thanksgiving \u00e2\u0080\u0094 well, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be really behind the eight ball to put together a well-prepared, well-documented transfer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Whitty said. At Playfair Planning in Brooklyn, CEO Kim Bourne is advising clients more than ever to file estate-tax returns even when they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to. This gets asset valuations on paper \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a move that will ease cost-basis determinations later on, she said. Bourne\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clients aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t speeding up gifts right now, but she is recommending they think about loans among family members. A loan doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t eat into the gift and estate exemption, and it can always be converted to a \u00e2\u0080\u009cgift\u00e2\u0080\u009d later on, once planners know the legal landscape. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIntrafamily loans are a simple way to navigate the uncertainty and take advantage of the low-interest environment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. The election is influencing other long-term financial planning. Encore:Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 401(k) plan: Changing tax incentive for retirement is a great idea Opinion: Will Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 401(k) plan help you or hurt you? The coming election \u00e2\u0080\u009cwas a very critical component, but it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t everything that was discussed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d when Randy Bruns\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Naperville, Ill.\u00e2\u0080\u0093based financial advisory firm, Model Wealth, carried out approximately 50 conversions this year from IRAs to Roth IRAs. Investors pay tax on IRA distributions once they start tapping the account. With a Roth IRA, they pay taxes during the contribution, and the money comes out tax-free at distribution \u00e2\u0080\u0094 so the reasoning for a Roth account is to avoid a higher tax rate in the future. \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098This is all going up and you may never see it as good as it is now.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Randy Bruns, Model Wealth When Bruns explains the election implications to clients, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not taking a political stance on the merits of potential tax hikes, he notes. Focusing on rates, he tells his clients, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is all going up, and you may never see it as good as it is now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Capital gains and ordinary income Unlike vanquished rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, Biden is not proposing a \u00e2\u0080\u009cwealth tax\u00e2\u0080\u009d on the highest earners. But he does want to reset the top income-tax bracket at 39.6%. He also wants the rich to pay more into Social Security. Employers and employees currently pay a combined 12.4% in payroll taxes on the first $137,700 an employee earns. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal would restart payroll taxation, still at 12.4%, at the 400,001st dollar a person makes. Under the circumstances, Stacy Francis, CEO of Francis Financial in Manhattan, says she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s telling clients expecting a bonus or other special end-of-year compensation to see if they can arrange for the money to arrive by the end of this year and not at the start of next year. Capital-gains rates are another consideration. Biden would raise the capital-gains rate to 39.6% for people making at least $1 million. That would go up from 23.8% (which is the 20% rate, plus the 3.8% net investment income tax). That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cnearly doubling the tax bite for higher earners,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Francis pointed out \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and it could have repercussions for people with large transactions coming up. For example, if a family needs to sell off a brokerage account because of an upcoming college tuition bill or a house purchase, Francis said \u00e2\u0080\u009cit makes sense to do that sooner than later.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only if you know that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to have to sell investments in the next year or so that we recommend you do that now versus later.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Stacy Francis, Francis Financial Francis is not advising investors with long-term positions and goals to contemplate selloffs now. Election Day 2020 is uncertain, but the uncertainty only increases from that point forward. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTen years from now, the tax landscape is so uncharted,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Francis said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only if you know that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to have to sell investments in the next year or so that we recommend you do that now versus later.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0098We can only protect what we know about\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Broader tax rules are one way to generate more revenue. Another is making sure taxpayers are paying all their taxes to begin with. The 2020 presidential campaign comes with an increasingly short-staffed Internal Revenue Service auditing fewer returns. The agency data show the IRS audited 1.73 million returns (almost 1% of all returns) in fiscal year 2010. The IRS audited just over 770,000 returns in fiscal 2019, which is fewer than 0.5%. Figures like former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a Biden campaign adviser \u00e2\u0080\u0094 say the IRS could reap an extra $535 billion if it brought audit rates back to their level of 10 years ago and trained its focus on the super-rich. This summer, the IRS announced it would be launching hundreds of new audits of high-net-worth individuals. Around the same time, Biden unveiled a plan for universal preschool and higher caregiver pay; the campaign says it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a $775 billion plan underwritten, in part, by increased \u00e2\u0080\u009ctax compliance for high-income earners.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tax attorney Cameron Hess expects both parties to support increased high-net-worth audits. Political attitudes about the IRS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s audit rates swing like a pendulum, said Hess, a partner at the California-based law firm Wagner Kirkman Blaine Klomparens & Youmans. At one point, starting around the 1990s, the IRS was seen as too aggressive. \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098Perhaps there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more support by Democrats than Republicans, but there is a push to swing the pendulum back the other way.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Cameron Hess Now it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a question of whether the IRS is doing enough. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more support by Democrats than Republicans,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hess, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut there is a push to swing the pendulum back the other way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Looking ahead to Election Day and beyond, Hess has been telling clients, and tax-business colleagues, how important it is for them to have access to permanent records related to the costs of their capital assets. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something the IRS has become increasingly curious about, Hess said. When Hoppe talks to clients about the election, one thing he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doing is flagging the potential for an audit. Specifically, Hoppe is making sure he knows about all the offshore accounts a client may have, or if a client has any cryptocurrency holdings he might otherwise be unaware of. Hoppe says he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already meticulous in his documentation, but still, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can only protect what we know about.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}]}
