KKR, -0.61% announced Wednesday an agreement to buy retirement and life insurance company Global Atlantic Financial Group Ltd., which had a book value of about $4.4 billion as of March 31. KKR said the acquisition of Global Atlantic, which has over $70 billion of adjusted invested assets, represents an expansion in the global insurance business, which is a strategic focus of the investment firm. The deal is expected to close in early 2021. \"This transaction is highly strategic for KKR - it meaningfully expands our base of permanent capital, further diversifies and scales our business, and significantly grows our position within the insurance industry, which has been increasing its exposure to alternative investment strategies,\" said Joseph Bae and Scott Nuttall, KKR's co-presidents and co-chief operating officers. KKR's stock, which was still inactive in premarket trading, has gained 5.6% year to date, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% has slipped 2.7%."}]}
