The area, which includes the five boroughs as well as Newark and Jersey City, N.J., saw its unemployment rate rise to 17%, up from 15.3% in May and significantly higher than the national rate of 11.2% in June, as the former epicenter of the pandemic continued to shed jobs, according to data from the U.S. Labor Department on Wednesday. New York City may have finally entered Phase 4 of its reopening, but with museums and Broadway theaters closed, bars and restaurants only open for limited outdoor seating, and travel restrictions placed on incoming visitors from the vast majority of U.S. states, the city\u2019s economy is still a shell of its usual self. Employment numbers have plunged accordingly. The Los Angeles metro area followed New York in the volume of jobless, with nonfarm employment down 650,400 in June compared to a year ago. Chicago came in third, shedding 466,000 jobs in June. All three densely populated metros have seen high rates of coronavirus.

Andrew Cuomo said during a briefing Wednesday, with 1.1% of more than 62,000 tests given yesterday coming back positive. Meanwhile, 619 people were hospitalized statewide on Tuesday, the lowest number since March 18, and 76 people were intubated, the lowest number since March 15. Five New Yorkers died statewide. \u201cAll the news on our numbers and our status is all very good,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cThe whole goal now is to protect our progress. We\u2019re doing very well and want to make sure we continue to do well even though the sea around us is roiled.\u201d With the virus under control, Cuomo said, \u201cWe\u2019re in the position of saying to people, \u2018come back.\u2019\u201d He expressed concern over low revenues across the state and the number of residents who have relocated during the pandemic. The hospitality industry also remains in flux, with indoor dining on hold indefinitely, and shifting regulations resulting in the State Liquor Authority issuing 29 violations to city bars and restaurants on Tuesday alone.

I think this is all a very dangerous combination.\u201d"}]}
