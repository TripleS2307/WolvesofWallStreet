The market appears to be \u201cunfazed and unamused\u201d by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies\u2019 decision to taper production cuts from 9.7 million barrels per day to 7.7 million barrels starting from August, said Lukman Otunuga, senior research analyst at FXTM. \u201cAlthough oil demand has jumped in recent weeks due to easing lockdown restrictions, tapering production cuts may be premature given the state of the global economy and rising coronavirus cases in the United States,\u201d he told MarketWatch. \u201cAny signs of lockdown measures being reinstated or global growth crumbling even further could trigger demand side fears\u2014ultimately exposing WTI and Brent crude to downside shocks.\u201d The U.S. counted more than 70,000 coronavirus cases Thursday to set a new record for the most in a single day, while the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 edged closer to 14 million and regions resumed restrictions on movement in a battle to contain the spread.

We also expect U.S. production declines to continue given low activity levels,\u201d he said, noting that Jefferies raised its second-half 2020 Brent forecast to $43 a barrel from $37 a barrel, while leaving its 2021 and 2022 forecasts unchanged at $48 a barrel and $55 a barrel, respectively. U.S. crude supplies fell by 7.5 million barrels for the week ended July 10, the Energy Information Administration reported Wednesday, helping to lift WTI and Brent prices for that session to their highest settlements in more than four months.
