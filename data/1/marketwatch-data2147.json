In an interview on Sunday with CBS News\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d CEO Albert Bourla said there is a \u201cgood chance\u201d of getting key data from late-stage trials to the Food and Drug Administration by the end of October, and that the company is already producing the vaccine, just in case. \u201cWe started already manufacturing, and we have already manufactured hundreds of thousands of doses, so just in case we have a good study readout, conclusive, and FDA, plus the advisory committee, feels comfortable, that we will be ready,\u201d Bourla said.

And also, I wanted to keep Pfizer out of politics.\u201d \u201d \u2014 Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla Bourla said Pfizer has already invested about $1.5 billion into the vaccine effort. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s only money. But that will not break the company, although it\u2019s going to be painful,\u201d he said of the possibility that the vaccine does not prove to be effective. On Saturday, Pfizer and BioNTech sought FDA approval to expand their Phase 3 vaccine trial to up to 44,000 participants, up from the originally planned 30,000. In July, the companies announced a $1.95 billion deal with the U.S. government to produce 100 million doses of the vaccine, if it wins approval by regulators. The vaccine effort by Pfizer and BioNTech is one of many currently underway. On Saturday, AstraZeneca PLC AZN, +1.16% said it has resumed its vaccine study in the U.K. after halting global studies last week to investigate an unexplained illness in a participant. While British regulators said the trial was safe to proceed, the study remains paused in other countries."}]}
