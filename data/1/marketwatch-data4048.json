Guess what: You\u2019re laughing all the way to the bank if you own the stock NYT, -3.79%. If you\u2019d bought it the day Trump was elected in 2016, you\u2019d be up 244% though Friday, including dividends. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% ? Up 47% over that span. That\u2019s right: The Times has outperformed the broad market by a factor of five. If that\u2019s \u201cfailure,\u201d sign me up. Digital subscriptions for the Times and the other paper Trump is most prone to bash, the Washington Post \u2014 owned by Amazon AMZN, +3.01% founder Jeff Bezos \u2014 have surged since 2016, as Americans clamor for the kind of comprehensive, in-your-face coverage that only those two papers \u2014 plus the more Trump-friendly Wall Street Journal (which, like MarketWatch, is published by Dow Jones, a division of News Corp NWS, -1.29% ) \u2014 seem capable of providing. \u201c While Trump regularly calls the New York Times and CNN \u2018fake news,\u2019 other parts of the U.S. media landscape eagerly swallow whatever Trump is serving up. \u201d But as these papers\u2019 coverage of Trump \u2014 robust, fierce and unrelenting \u2014 continues, there\u2019s another angle to the newspaper industry that has been far more beneficial to Trump, first as a candidate and now as a president: namely, that there are hardly any papers left around the country to challenge him. More on this in a second. First, some data: Since 2004, says a study by the University of North Carolina, some 1,800 newspapers \u2014 one in every five \u2014 has shut down. Citing a report by none other than the federal government, the UNC study says that \u201clocal newspapers are the best medium to provide the sort of public-service journalism that shines a light on the major issues confronting communities and gives residents the information they need to solve their problems.\u201d When a local newspaper dies, who\u2019s going to hold politicians accountable? Who will talk to the mayor? Who will cover boring but vital meetings at City Hall? Who will dig through municipal records, report on potholes, the town budget, crime, real estate and other important issues? And who will do a nice write-up on the county fair? So when a local paper dies, creating an information vacuum, a community is the poorer for it. The 1,800 papers gone since 2004? That\u2019s 1,800 tears in the fabric of our republic. Here\u2019s where Trump comes in. When that information vacuum exists (the UNC study calls it a \u201cnews desert\u201d), it\u2019s easier for a politician to fill it with the kind of unchallenged demagoguery, distortions and \u2014 sorry \u2014 outright lies that are the tricks of Trump\u2019s trade. Trump was smart in 2016. He went from town to town, rally to rally, and kept hammering away on the key themes that made his base stick to him like glue. They were victims, he said, of a rapidly evolving economy. Demographic, cultural changes and more were leaving them behind, ignored, disrespected and unwanted. There weren\u2019t many local voices to counter him, to provide the citizenry with any other information. This is one reason Trump hates the Times, the Post and cable outlets like CNN T, -1.01% ; they have the resources to employ armies of reporters and fact checkers to dig into everything, pore over every word he says and tell you what he\u2019s really up to. This infuriates him. Thus these outlets are \u201cfake news,\u201d \u201ccorrupt\u201d and the \u201cenemy of the American people.\u201d Translated: \u201cI\u2019m angry that these journalists are checking things out on their own, instead of just accepting whatever I say at face value.\u201d It drives him nuts. Of course, other parts of the U.S. media landscape eagerly swallow whatever Trump is serving up. The nation\u2019s two top radio talkers \u2014 Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity \u2014 are reliable cheerleaders, happy to spread the president\u2019s message to their millions of listeners. There are left-wingers on the radio, too, of course, but none comes close to the vast audiences that Limbaugh, Hannity and other right-wing personalities command each day. Trump also has a powerful ally \u2014 perhaps one you\u2019ve never heard of, dependent on where you live \u2014 in Sinclair Broadcast Group SBGI, -2.01%, which owns 191 TV stations on 607 channels in 89 markets nationwide, including concentrations of stations in key swing states that will be pivotal in November, as they were four years ago: Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Florida, among others. You might think that the void left by the demise of so many local newspapers might be filled by robust local TV reporting. But you know what Sinclair did? In 2017, it hired one of Trump\u2019s early White House aides, the Russian-born Boris Epshteyn, and for two years required its stations to carry his pro-Trump editorials (the editorials, and thus the requirement to air them, were done away with in December). This right-wing tilt is reflected in campaign contributions by Sinclair and its employees, who have traditionally given far more to Republicans: 61%, 98%, 98% and 97% in the last four presidential election years, respectively. Curiously, however, such donations in 2020 have thus far been evenly split. You\u2019ve never heard Trump call outlets that love him \u201cfake.\u201d Only the ones that try to fact check him, and that now includes Twitter TWTR, -0.23%, which isn\u2019t censoring the president, as he claims; it\u2019s providing other customers with additional information and context. Between hundreds of local newspapers dying off, and his radio and TV allies, including Fox \u2014 with which he airs the occasional grievance, including on Wednesday, when he took issue with the channel\u2019s cutting away from a congressional hearing \u2014 and the groveling One America News Network, the media is far more favorable to the president than he\u2019d have you believe. Fox News FOX, -1.45% is by far the most dominant cable news channel. Limbaugh and Hannity blow away the radio competition. I haven\u2019t even mentioned Facebook FB, +0.26%, whose CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has done Trump a yuge favor by saying he doesn\u2019t think social networks should fact check what politicians post. It\u2019s fair to ask: Doesn\u2019t all of this balance out \u2014 if not outweigh \u2014 the likes of the Times, the Post and MSNBC? Trump\u2019s claim that the media are dominated by lefties who are out to get him \u2014 I\u2019m not sure that passes the fact-check test."}]}
