For real this time.", "body": "It\u2019s time to rotate, Jefferies analysts say. That is, it\u2019s time to swap growth stocks like technology, which have had a long run up since March, for unloved stocks like cyclicals. It\u2019s an idea that\u2019s emerged over and over again over the past few years \u2014 see here and here \u2014 only to be abandoned when investors get spooked and retreat back to the familiar growth narrative. But now, Steven DeSanctis and Eric Lockenvitz write, the economic outlook and stock market fundamentals have aligned. Growth stock \u201cvaluations are at extremes and economic indicators are turning up, boosting cyclicals,\u201d the analysts write. \u201cThese stocks have started to come back to life a bit but remain very cheap with the cyclicals sitting in the single-digit percentiles vs. Growth, Bond Proxies.\u201d \u201cThe ISM has made a bottom and is improving along with the PMI and so it has become a better economic backdrop for these stocks,\u201d they added. What\u2019s more, earnings and sales revision trends are getting better for cyclicals, while deteriorating for growth stocks. MarketWatch reported last week that multiple investing industry sources agree that it\u2019s time for investors to consider cyclicals, but not necessarily abandon growth stocks. With that in mind, DeSanctis and Lockenvitz helpfully offer a baker\u2019s dozen of buy-rated stocks from cyclical sectors, which they say have \u201cabove-average\u201d return on equity and which have not experienced a downward earnings or sales revision, as noted in the table below.
