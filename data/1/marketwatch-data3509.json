Tiffany shares slumped 13% in premarket trade, while LVMH was 0.5% lower in Paris. Tiffany for its part said it filed a lawsuit in Delaware to enforce the acquisition. \"The lawsuit not only makes clear that LVMH is in breach of its obligations relating to obtaining antitrust clearance, but also refutes LVMH's suggestions that it can avoid completing the acquisition by claiming Tiffany has undergone a Material Adverse Effect (\"MAE\") or breached its obligations under the Merger Agreement, or that the transaction is in some way inconsistent with its patriotic duties as a French corporation,\" said the Tiffany release."}]}
