Hundreds of advertisers have publicly announced they are ceasing advertising purchases from Facebook FB, +0.26% in a protest labeled #StopHateForProfit, which launched Wednesday and focuses on the company\u2019s inability to properly rein in racist and violent content as well as misinformation. Advertising experts say those decisions are not so wrenching, though \u2014 boycotting Facebook is obviously more cost-effective than paying for ads, they receive free media publicity and appeal to socially-conscious consumers. \u201cBy pulling ads, they save money and make a low-risk statement that results in positive publicity and marketing for their brands among constituents,\u201d said Gerard Francis Corbett, a communications strategy consultant based in Silicon Valley. \u201cThe Facebook boycott is a lower-risk way for CEOs to make a [political] statement.\u201d Societal and economic stars aligned for companies to take stands after years of uneasiness about content on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter Inc. TWTR, -0.23%, and other social-media platforms, Corbett and others say. Facebook has inflamed marketers, Facebook users and employees, and anti-hate groups for years, but advertisers largely stuck with the platform. The confluence of a once-in-a-century pandemic, rampant unemployment, and social unrest not seen since 1968 have upturned movements against corporations in ways unimaginable only a few years ago, say branding experts. \u201cThere is a perfect storm of corporate responsibility during coronavirus and Black Lives Matter, and a need to contain costs during a recession,\u201d John Marcinuk, head of marketing at Blue Fountain Media, told MarketWatch in a phone interview Monday. \u201cWhether you\u2019re spending a dime or $20 million on a platform, if you have a stand to take, now is the time to do it.\u201d See also: After years of talk, tech companies appear to be getting serious about diversity efforts Facebook has worked feverishly behind the scenes. Company executives held at least two meetings with advertisers Tuesday, according to a Reuters report that cited three people who participated in the calls, and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg planned another call with boycott organizers Tuesday. \u201cWe regularly engage with, listen to and learn from civil rights leaders and organizations. Last week, we reached out to the NAACP, ADL and Color of Change and offered a meeting with our COO and CPO because they\u2019ve made product-specific requests,\u201d a Facebook spokesperson said in an email. \u201cThey asked about having Mark at the meeting, and we\u2019ve since confirmed that Mark is able to join. We\u2019re waiting to hear back and look forward to the opportunity to continue the dialogue.\u201d The meeting could be combustible: Zuckerberg has told Facebook employees he expects members of a month-long advertising boycott to \u201cbe back on the platform soon enough,\u201d according to news site The Information late Wednesday. In a lengthy Facebook post Friday, Zuckerberg responded by committing to remove content that \u201cincites violence\u201d or suppresses voting, \u201cno matter where it comes from\u201d \u2014 including from politicians like President Donald Trump. On Monday, Facebook officially banned some groups linked to the radical \u201cboogaloo\u201d movement after a member was accused of using the Facebook platform to organize the May shooting death of a federal officer in Oakland, Calif. And late Tuesday, Zuckerberg agreed to meet with boycott organizers, a company spokesperson confirmed to MarketWatch. \u201cWe may never be able to prevent hate from appearing on Facebook entirely, but we are getting better at stopping it all the time,\u201d Nick Clegg, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global affairs/communications, tweeted on Wednesday.

In all, roughly 400 companies worldwide had joined the ban as of Tuesday morning, and nearly a third of advertisers are considering joining a month-long boycott of Facebook and other social media platforms, according to a survey by the World Federation of Advertisers of 58 corporate members whose cumulative annual ad spending is $92 billion. Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +2.48%, PepsiCo Inc. PEP, +0.42%, Ford Motor Co. F, -1.36%, Starbucks Corp. SBUX, +0.53%, Coca-Cola Co. KO, +0.69%, Verizon Communications Inc. VZ, +0.23%, SAP SAP, +0.65%, and Unilever UL, +1.44% are among the high-profile names to hit pause on advertising on Facebook. See also: Here are the major brands that have pulled ads from Facebook Many companies had publicly disclosed in earnings reports and calls that they expected to dial back advertising spending during the grip of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ad spending nationwide is expected to drop 13% to $207.9 billion, excluding political ads, according to GroupM, a unit of WPP. As recently as December, WPP was forecasting a 4% jump in 2020. Consider Coca-Cola. Before the boycott, the soft drink maker reported a 25% slump in first-quarter sales volumes, and CEO James Quincey warned advertising vendors on an April earnings call that \u201cfrom April and until further notice we\u2019re putting commercial advertising for Coca-Cola and all our brands on hold.\u201d Quincey proclaimed Monday that Coca-Cola would stop all social-media postings along with any advertising for at least 30 days as of July 1. \u201cWe will take this time to reassess our advertising standards and policies to determine whether revisions are needed internally, and what more we should expect of our social media partners to rid the platforms of hate, violence and inappropriate content. We will let them know we expect greater accountability, action and transparency from them,\u201d Quincey said in a post on the soft-drink company\u2019s website. Coca-Cola did not respond to an email message seeking comment. Unilever spent more than $11.8 million in the U.S. this year on Facebook, according to marketing analytics company Pathmatics, but Unilever CEO Alan Jope halted any new major ad productions that were in the works, according to the company\u2019s first-quarter earnings call in early March. Jope said he was reviewing ad spending to take advantage of cheaper ad rates, and \u201cdialing up areas with strong ROI.\u201d The maker of Dove soap joined the boycott Friday, stating that given \u201cthe polarized atmosphere in the U.S., we have decided that starting now through at least the end of the [calendar] year, we will not run brand advertising in social media newsfeed platforms Facebook, Instagram and Twitter in the U.S.\u201d \u201cThis isn\u2019t as big a deal for these companies [boycotters] to make this decision as before. We should give them accidental credit,\u201d Tara Hunt, CEO of DIY marketing platform Phlywheel, told MarketWatch. \u201cCompanies are jumping on causes around COVID-19 and Black Lives Matter. Here is another bandwagon to jump on and say how much we care.\u201d Some $1 billion to $1.5 billion in commitments for third-quarter ad spending could be canceled, ad buyers estimate. PepsiCo, General Motors Co. GM, -0.15% and General Mills Inc. GIS, +0.78%, among others, have indicated they would consider stepping back ad spending in the calendar third quarter, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.

Most companies have not said it is a permanent ban on purchasing Facebook ads, and some have only committed to time frames such as a month. \u201cMarketing leaders are taking an economic risk: They believe they\u2019re gaining brand equity by aligning themselves on the right side of history with short-term impact,\u201d Julia Stead, chief marketing officer at Allocadia, a budget management and strategic planning platform, told MarketWatch. What will be telling, she added, is whether the brands stick with their boycott more than a month. Tech platforms have seen advertisers return after similar issue-based boycotts. Three years ago, major brands including Verizon, AT&T Inc. T, -1.01%, Pepsi, and Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +1.39% pulled millions of dollars in advertising from YouTube amid rows over extremist content on Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOGL, +1.82% GOOG, +1.97% video-sharing platform. YouTube collected $8.2 billion in ad revenue in 2017 despite the protests, a total that grew more than 35% in both 2018 and 2019. See also: Zuckerberg was reportedly talked out of making moves against Trump More than two years ago, when Facebook found itself enmeshed in embarrassing disclosures about Cambrige Analytica \u2014 a political consultancy that harvested millions of Facebook users\u2019 personal data without their consent to be predominantly used for political advertising \u2014 threats of a boycott among marketers largely fizzled. Unilever and Procter & Gamble Co. PG, +0.89% voiced objections but stuck with Facebook. Mozilla Corp. did not. The maker of the Firefox web browser was the first consumer product company to pull all advertising from Facebook 18 months ago, and hasn\u2019t returned since. \u201cWe stopped then because we believed their response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal was insufficient, and that the policies and practices that led to the scandal demonstrated that Facebook was not taking adequate care to safeguard people\u2019s personal data on their platform,\u201d Mozilla Interim CMO, Mary Ellen Muckerman said in a statement to MarketWatch. \u201cAs a result, we not only stopped our advertising spend, but we stopped using Facebook to promote Mozilla or Firefox. Like other companies now, we find what Facebook is doing in this moment to be problematic as well. Barring any significant changes in their actions, we have no plans to resume our advertising on Facebook.\u201d \u201cI sincerely hope that they [Facebook ad boycotters] think when they consider a return to Facebook whether it should be as dominant in their plans as before,\u201d Hunt said."}]}
