Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who had asked why the government hadn't stopped \"that type of activity.\" When the number of coronavirus cases began to increase, airlines cut and canceled flights and in many cases banned the use of booking middle seats, to allow for social distancing on their aircraft. On Friday, American said it \"will continue to notify customers and allow them to move to more open flights when available.\" Airline stocks began to rebound last week, likely because of increasing travel demand.
