The Pulitzer Prize- and Tony Award-winning musical of the founding father's life delivered a spike in app downloads on Walt Disney Co.'s DIS, +1.53%  Disney+ over the July 4 weekend. The movie version of Lin-Manuel Miranda's play premiered on Friday and, through Sunday, the Disney+ app was downloaded 752,451 times globally, including 458,796 times in the U.S., according to analytics firm Apptopia. This represents a 74% jump in average downloads over the four weekends in June 2020, according to Apptopia data. Worldwide app downloads were 47% higher this past weekend than the average of the four prior Friday-Sunday totals. Worldwide numbers do not include India or Japan because Disney+ is delivered through pre-existing apps in those countries.

No matter how you cut it, the runaway success of \"Hamilton\" - which some feared might bring down the internet - should provide a boom in its fierce competition with Apple Inc.'s AAPL, +1.74%  Apple TV+, Netflix Inc. NFLX, +1.43%  , AT&T Inc.'s T, -1.01%  HBO Max, Amazon.com Inc.'s AMZN, +3.01%  Prime Video, and other streaming services. Disney is banking on \"Hamilton\" to draw paying customers in droves. The movie, a \"live\" recording of the musical as it appeared on stage in New York, was shifted by Disney to a direct-to-streaming release a year before it was to scheduled to appear in theaters because of the coronavirus pandemic. Since mid-June, Disney+ stopped offering a free seven-day trial offer in hopes that \"Hamilton\" would give it a bump in paid subscribers. As of early May, the service had 54.5 million subscribers world-wide just six months after its launch. It costs $6.99 a month or $69.99 a year in the U.S."}]}
