In addition, customers are ordering for larger groups of people. \u201cI think that\u2019s because instead of the person working and going out to lunch maybe with a group, [when] they\u2019re all paying [for] themselves, now it\u2019s going to the restaurant and then ordering for the family,\u201d said John Hartung, Chipotle\u2019s CMG, +0.01% chief financial officer, on the late Wednesday earnings call, according to a FactSet transcript. Chipotle is down 1.6% in Thursday trading despite beating earnings and revenue expectations. Analysts, who attribute the share slide to lofty investor expectations, remain largely upbeat about the fast-casual chain due to its digital investments, its real estate prospects and its continued menu innovations.

And last week, the company began testing cauliflower rice. Chipotle also recently introduced a digital-only option, quesadillas. \u201cThe company\u2019s March 1 launch of Queso Blanco has seen good reception following targeted marketing that uses its growing customer data to drive product attachment,\u201d wrote JPMorgan analysts in a note, who say other items are being considered for a digital-only menu. \u201cChipotle has also learned that in the early days of the digital-only quesadilla launch, people are willing to go through the app/digital experience just to get the product.\u201d JPMorgan rates Chipotle stock neutral and raised its price target $20 to $1,040. A number of upbeat analysts have raised Chipotle\u2019s price target post-earnings announcement. Wedbush, with a stock rating of outperform, moved its price target to $1,320 from $1,200. RBC Capital Markets, with a sector perform stock rating, raised its price target to $1,250 from $1,125. And SunTrust Robinson Humphrey\u2019s buy rating has a $1,358 price target, up from $1,336. \u201cWhile 2Q and 3QTD comps (-9.8% and +6.4%, respectively) appear to have fallen just short of the high bar set by investor expectations heading into earnings, the 2Q\u2019s sequential topline and margin improvement, along with strong, sustained digital mix, and a higher visibility path to margin and earnings recovery by the end of the year are nonetheless impressive given the challenging backdrop of this spring,\u201d wrote RBC\u2019s Christopher Carill in a note. Also: Domino\u2019s Pizza could snap up market share with \u2018improved\u2019 chicken wings Bernstein analysts are also confident that there will be more new menu items to come. \u201cThe power of topline drivers like Queso Blanco (high teens mix) and salads are a testament to the efficacy of the stage-gate process as well as the long runway for menu innovation that awaits,\u201d wrote analysts led by Sara Senatore. The stage-gate process are the steps Chipotle takes to introduce new dishes to the menu. Queso Blanco, for example, was launched using the stage-gate process. \u201cChipotle\u2019s ability to retain 70%+ of digital sales even as dining room volumes recover (now at 50% of previous levels) reflects the strong value proposition of Chipotle generally and digital ordering specifically.\u201d Bernstein rates Chipotle stock outperform with a $1,300 target price. Chipotle stock has rallied 34% for the year to date while the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% has edged up 0.2% for the period."}]}
