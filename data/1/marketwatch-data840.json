Trump has come up short on\u00c2 strategies to address COVID-19\u00c2 and the crisis of confidence in our national institutions to offer all Americans a fair chance at succeeding. On Inauguration Day, we will likely have a vaccine in hand or in sight, but a hangover and the endemic economic problems will remain. The economy will be substantial smaller in January than had the pandemic not occurred, millions will still be seeking work, and\u00c2 inequality will likely be worse than before. Related: The numbers tell us the economy is better, but millions of Americans aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feeling it Joe Biden\u00c2 would spend trillions on health care, higher education, green initiatives and other programs. Across those initiatives, he would impose aggressive preferences for\u00c2 women,\u00c2 minorities,\u00c2 and\u00c2 small businesses\u00e2\u0080\u0094the kind that history has shown to be not adequately effective at radically reducing income inequality. He promises federal funding for pre-K education and\u00c2 preferences for unions\u00e2\u0080\u0094including \u00e2\u0080\u009ccard check,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which would free unions of the terrible inconvenience of winning democratic representation elections. Some of these issues need attention\u00e2\u0080\u0094health care and higher education are terribly expensive and leave too many shortchanged\u00e2\u0080\u0094but it is not clear that Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s program would get to the roots of those problems. Opinion: Trump and Biden \u00e2\u0080\u0098Made in America\u00e2\u0080\u0099 tax plans ignore the real problem He would\u00c2 build on Obamacare\u00c2 to insure more Americans by expanding Medicaid\u00e2\u0080\u009414 states still don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fully participate\u00e2\u0080\u0094and raising income caps for who may qualify for subsidies when purchasing insurance on government exchanges. Biden would create a public option\u00e2\u0080\u0094federal and state-run insurance plans to compete with private carriers. He would\u00c2 require drug companies to charge Americans for prescriptions no more than they charge in other high-income countries. That would impose price controls and effectively outsource the price setting to regulators in Germany and other advanced industrialized countries. The United States spends\u00c2 18% of GDP\u00c2 on health care and nearly\u00c2 90 percent more than other high-income nations, because\u00c2 we pay more\u00c2 for virtually everything\u00e2\u0080\u0094doctor visits, hospital services and drugs. Prescription drugs only account for about 10% of health costs. For other services, by further subsidizing insurance, his program would drive up demand and costs, and make the U.S. system even more expensive and an even greater burden on U.S. businesses competing in international markets. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a jobs killer. We send\u00c2 too many young people to college, where many don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t acquire the\u00c2 critical thinking\u00c2 abilities\u00c2 necessary for professional work or few other job specific skills. Biden proposes\u00c2 to build out vocational programs in community colleges, offer more university tuition assistance and partially forgive student loans for those stuck in low-paying jobs Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2 Labor Department certified private-sector apprenticeships\u00c2 allow young people to earn while they learn. Graduates usually land jobs that pay more than the average starting salary of a college graduate and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t amass college debt. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tuition subsidies and student loan forgiveness would increase university enrollment but do little to improve the quality of curricula and reduce college graduate underemployment. Biden wants to\u00c2 accelerate the transition\u00c2 to carbon-free cars, buildings, electricity and the like by spending\u00c2 $2 trillion over four years.\u00c2 Those goals are laudable but much of the technology is not here yet. He admits this by proposing generous allocations to uncover\u00c2 breakthrough technologies in energy\u00c2 and other R & D. He needs something that is not possible with his antagonists in the Democratic Party\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Green New Dealers\u00e2\u0080\u0094a reasonable discussion of what is possible and how quickly. More from MarketWatch: The West burns, coastlines are threatened, and Trump and Biden are too quiet on climate change, say analysts As we learned with the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and\u00c2 President Barack Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Solyndra follies, more money alone cannot accelerate the pace of scientific progress. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s program would subsidize early adoption of inadequate technologies and 10 years from now leave the country with more green energy infrastructure that is terribly outdated and internationally uncompetitive. A more expensive fleet of vehicles, buildings and electrical grid\u00e2\u0080\u0094more jobs killers. Biden, like European Social Democrats, makes few bows to the mandates of the marketplace, because he presides over a political party that views free markets with some considerable suspicion. It increasingly embraces the\u00c2 1619 Project\u00e2\u0080\u0099s false narrative of slave-conceived capitalism\u00c2 and racial/gender prejudices to explain our economic system\u00e2\u0080\u0099s failures and has boundless faith in the ability of government to deliver. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s program would leave America too much like Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0094unable to grow and riddled with massive unemployment and underemployment.
