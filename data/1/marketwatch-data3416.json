The great bubbles can go on a long time and inflict a lot of pain but at least I think we know now that we're in one. And the chutzpah involved in having a bubble at a time of massive economic and financial uncertainty is substantial.' \u201d That is Jeremy Grantham, co-founder and chief investment strategist at Boston-based money manager Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo & Co., offering up a stark warning to speculators driving the stock market to new heights amid the greatest pandemic of the past century. \"This is really the real McCoy, this is crazy stuff,\" said Grantham during a Wednesday afternoon interview on CNBC that appeared to knock some of the stuffing out of a market that had been drifting along listlessly on Wednesday. Gratham painted a very dire picture of the investment landscape in the U.S., suggesting that rampant trading by out-of-work investors and speculative fervor around bankrupt companies, including car-rental company Hertz Global Holdings Inc. HTZ, -1.78%, reflects a market that may be the most bubblicious he's seen in his storied career.

Markets, however, have been busting higher since hitting a low on March 23. Indeed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% has zoomed 40.5% higher since late March, the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% has climbed 39% and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.39% has soared more than 44% over the period, establishing an all-time high last week for the first time since Feb. 19 Grantham is worth paying attention to due to his prescient calls over the years. He said that stocks were overvalued in 2000 and again in 2007, anticipating those market downturns, the Wall Street Journal reports. Grantham also signaled that elements of the financial market had become unmoored from reality leading up to the 2008-09 financial crisis.
