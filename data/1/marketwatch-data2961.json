The S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% just banged out another record high, as did the Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39% \u00c2 . The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% \u00c2 still has a ways to go. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to be a rocket scientist to figure this out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cramer said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust look the stocks that have brought us to these levels \u00e2\u0080\u0094 they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not the recovery plays. In fact, they are the opposite. They are stocks that tend to do well, because of what we call secular considerations.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talking about digitization, short hand for \u00e2\u0080\u009ccut out the fat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as Cramer sees it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not \u00e2\u0080\u009cclassic recovery stocks\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 industrials or retail or banks \u00e2\u0080\u0094 pushing indexes to new highs. Rather, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the likes of Apple AAPL, +1.74% \u00c2 , Amazon AMZ, +1.47% and Microsoft MSFT, +2.48% \u00c2 . \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe winners in this market are the companies that are most divorced from the underlying economy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cramer said on his \u00e2\u0080\u009cMad Money\u00e2\u0080\u009d show on Tuesday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe actual economy is in precarious shape, especially now that the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stimulus package has run out and Congress went home for the summer rather than trying to come up with a replacement.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Watch the full segment: div.youtube { height:0; position:relative; padding-bottom:56.25%; } div.youtube > iframe { position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; } The disconnect continued on Wednesday, with all major averages moving higher."}]}
