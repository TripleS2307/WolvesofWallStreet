A key driver for U.S. stocks on Monday was hope that experimental drugs used to treat Trump for COVID-19 might become more widely available to the public during the pandemic than expected. Read: History shows stock-market investors are quick to shrug off presidential health woes \u201cIf the leader of the free world is taking an experimental drug,\u201d it could mean that drug developers might be able to push through COVID-19 therapies sooner than expected, said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth, in an interview. \u201cAlso, there\u2019s a belief that we\u2019re closer to some type of stimulus from Congress,\u201d he said. Trump tweeted on Monday afternoon that he would be discharged from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center at 6:30 p.m., following a three-night stay. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Trump\u2019s physician Sean Conley said Trump met or exceeded discharge criteria, but that he\u2019s not yet \u201cout of the woods\u201d and that the next seven days will be crucial. Coronavirus update: Coronavirus update: Global case tally tops 35 million and deaths exceed 1 million, while Trump says \u2018don\u2019t be afraid of COVID\u2019 Investors were bracing for a volatile run-up to the Nov. 3 presidential election even before Trump\u2019s diagnosis last week. On Monday, the West Wing outbreak grew, including after White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany tested positive. Trump\u2019s contraction of the virus also \u201ccould lead to far broader adoption of mask-wearing as average Americans,\u201d wrote Kristina Hooper, Invesco\u2019s chief global markets strategist. \u201cIn turn, this could slow the spread of COVID-19, which should be a significant positive for the economy, especially as we worry about a possible second wave this fall.\u201d New York City on Monday said that schools in hotspots, including several ZIP Codes in Brooklyn and Queens, will close Tuesday. French authorities placed Paris back on \u201chigh alert\u201d for COVID-19 Monday, banning festivals and closing bars in the French capital and limiting social gatherings. Hooper also said Senate Republicans now might recognize \u201chow virulent the disease is, which could in turn prompt them to agree to a larger stimulus package.\u201d Results of a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll conducted in the two days following Tuesday\u2019s highly contentious presidential debate, but before news of Trump\u2019s COVID-19 diagnosis, showed Biden expanding his lead to 14 percentage points, a 53% to 39% advantage, among registered voters. The survey showed Biden with an 8-point lead last month and an 11-point advantage in July, previously his largest margin of the campaign. Analysts said prospects for a more decisive outcome on Nov. 3 could be a positive for markets. Fears have grown of an inconclusive election result that could see weeks of contentious political and legal wrangling. A growing lead for Biden also could make the White House and congressional Republicans more willing to give in to Democratic demands during drawn-out negotiations for a new round of stimulus to support the U.S. economy and households. Trump on Saturday also tweeted in favor of another round of stimulus. Fresh economic data also bolstered optimism for assets viewed as risky. The Institute for Supply Management said its index of activity among nonmanufacturing companies rose to 57.8% last month from 56.9% in August. Any number above 50 represents an expansion in industrial activity. Underlining the positives in the report, the employment portion of the ISM survey suggested more companies were adding jobs than they were letting go. As for the Federal Reserve, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said inflation could temporarily shoot above 2% next spring, testing the central bank\u2019s new inflation framework.
