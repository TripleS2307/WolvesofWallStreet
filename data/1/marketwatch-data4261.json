That has contributed to a slew of oil-company bankruptcies, though prices recently bounced back to levels not seen since March. \u201cShale operators are facing a mountain of debt that comes due soon,\u201d says Rene Santos, manager of North America supply, analytics at S&P Global Platts. Around 24 oil companies have also filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy so far this year and the count is \u201clikely to continue to increase.\u201d U.S. horizontal oil rigs, those that drill shale wells, have declined by 75% since mid-March and the \u201cshort-term outlook is negative,\u201d says Santos. Even if WTI oil climbs back to pre-Covid-19 levels of around $50 and operators start to increase rigs at that level, he says that would not change the shale oil outlook, as prices would need to see months of \u201cstable higher prices,\u201d and production would take months to react. Domestic shale production may recover somewhat in the next couple of months then decline again, pulling U.S. shale oil output down to 6.1 million barrels per day by year-end 2021, a 27% drop from March 2020, according to Santos. In June, domestic shale oil output was at around 7.3 million barrels per day, and he does not expect it to climb back to March level of 8.4 million barrels per day before the end of 2023.

We expect that to continue to be the case until the industry shrinks meaningfully from current levels.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Chris Duncan, Brandes Investment Partners \u201cAs it stands, the \u2018average\u2019 U.S. shale company has been a terrible investment,\u201d says Duncan. \u201cWe expect that to continue to be the case until the industry shrinks meaningfully from current levels.\u201d Among related exchange-traded funds, the VanEck Vectors Unconventional Oil & Gas ETF FRAK, -0.97% has fallen by around 39% this year. However, Santos says U.S. shale oil is \u201cprobably a good long-term investment.\u201d The resource is \u201cvery large, with the Permian being as large as the biggest oilfield in Saudi Arabia.\u201d The \u201cbreakevens,\u201d or oil price needed to get a return on new U.S. shale oil, are favorable around $38 for WTI, the pipeline infrastructure is capable of handling large increases in production and the nation continues to be a leader in shale production technology."}]}
