This series examines the financial progress made by women in the U.S. since the Equal Credit Opportunity Act was passed in 1974. In this installment: the 1980s, the decade when Congress officially declared March as Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s History Month.\u00c2 Strides in continued education While college was largely a boys\u00e2\u0080\u0099 club in the early 20th\u00c2 century, women turned that around during the 1980s. Beginning in the \u00e2\u0080\u009980s, more than half of bachelor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s degrees were awarded to women, according to the\u00c2 National Center for Education Statistics. Women also made up about half of graduates from master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s programs and nearly 30% of graduates with doctorates for the 1980-1981 school year, though these degrees were disproportionately awarded to white women. As women became more educated, their\u00c2 salaries began to increase in relation to men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s salaries. The income gap wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t closed during this time \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2 it remains today \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2 but it began shrinking as women attained more high-paying professional and managerial positions. The influence\u00c2 of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2 which allowed women to\u00c2 get a credit card\u00c2 separate from their husbands\u00c2 and ushered in a new level of financial freedom\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2 continued to increase. Women now had more career options and more financial clout. Also on MarketWatch: What does retirement mean for women? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to note that the wage gap between women of different races existed in the \u00e2\u0080\u009980s and still exists today. In 1989, white women working full time made a median weekly wage of $334, while Black women made $301 and Latina women made $269. According to the most recent data \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from 2018 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 while white women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s median weekly wage was $817 and Asian women made $937, Black women had a median wage of $654 and Latina women made $617 a week.

Sandra Day O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Connor became the first woman nominated to the Supreme Court in 1981.\u00c2 Geraldine Ferraro was the first female vice presidential candidate for a major party in 1984.\u00c2 EMILY\u00e2\u0080\u0099s List\u00c2 was founded in 1985 to help fund campaigns for Democratic women who supported abortion rights. Since it was started 35 years ago, EMILY\u00e2\u0080\u0099s List has helped nearly 1,300 women get elected to federal, state and local offices.Pop culture Television in the 1980s showcased women in the workplace supporting their families and themselves, while speaking out for women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rights and equality. Two\u00c2 TV\u00c2 shows, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFamily Ties\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Cosby Show,\u00e2\u0080\u009d weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t perfectly feminist sitcoms by any means, but they both starred strong, working female leads.

Elyse Keaton on \u00e2\u0080\u009cFamily Ties\u00e2\u0080\u009d was a hippie-turned-work-at-home-mom who raised four children with her husband, Steven, over the course of the show. Both worked full time, Steven in an office, and Elyse at home as an architect. The show made it clear that a woman needs an identity outside of her family and the ability to bring in an income in order to thrive in the modern world. The matriarch of \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Cosby Show,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Clair Huxtable \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a working mother of five \u00e2\u0080\u0094 delivers several pitch-perfect feminist speeches throughout the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eight seasons. She calls out the sexism of the men around her, refusing to bite her tongue when faced with chauvinistic attitudes. Clair was in a financial position that meant she arguably didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to work, but she chose to do so anyway. The show highlighted the importance of equality in marriage, with a division of household labor that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t all the responsibility of the wife.More from NerdWallet: Can a Credit Card Company Lower My Credit Limit?
