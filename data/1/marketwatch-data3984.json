I think they have been optimistic and they have been right, I think, up to now anyway. They were optimistic in the May-June time-frame and indeed the data came in and validated the market thinking,\" Bullard said. He added a big part of market capitalization is tech firms and pandemic has been a \"boon\" to this industry."}]}
