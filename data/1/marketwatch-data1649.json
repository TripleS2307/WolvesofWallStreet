Is a traditional IRA really the wrong way to invest for retirement?", "body": "Personal finance celebrity Suze Orman says retirement savers should steer clear of traditional accounts in lieu of Roth accounts, especially during this global pandemic. But like everything else in personal finance, that advice largely depends on the individual. During a conversation on the \u201cPivot\u201d podcast, Orman said savers should weigh the tax consequences of sticking with a traditional-style account, such as a 401(k), 403(b) or individual retirement account. Traditional accounts are funded with pretax dollars, whereas Roth accounts use after-tax dollars. Investors with traditional accounts pay taxes at the time of distribution, while withdrawals from Roth accounts are tax-free. What's the difference between a 401(k) and a Roth 401(k)? \u201cDo you really think that tax brackets aren\u2019t going to have to go up five, 10, 15 years from now in order to pay for all the debt that we\u2019re carrying? Of course they\u2019re going to have to,\u201d she said during her chat. People should flock to Roth accounts to take advantage of \u201cthe lowest tax brackets\u201d Americans will see for a while, she said. Orman\u2019s advice occasionally appears controversial, such as the time she suggested people should cut out to-go coffee if they ever want to comfortably retire. The problem with this particular piece of advice is that it\u2019s too general, said Monica Dwyer, vice president at Harvest Financial Advisors. \u201cI think that Suze is concerned that future taxes will be much higher because we cannot continue on the spending parade that we have been on, our deficit is ballooning and, just like someone with a lot of credit card debt, this debt will have crushing consequences at some point,\u201d she said. \u201cDoes that mean her advice is good? Not necessarily. It just depends on the person.\u201d See: Suze Orman wants you to stop \u2018peeing $1 million down the drain\u2019 Giving blanket advice on finances is always tricky, said Dennis Nolte, vice president of Seacoast Investment Services. Different accounts serve various purposes and usually fit within larger retirement savings and spending strategies. Generally, younger people benefit from Roth accounts as they are typically in low tax brackets while starting their careers and middle-aged people in their peak earning years benefit from traditional accounts, he said. It\u2019s also hard to tell what the future holds, even with the best intentions and plans. \u201cWith perfect information about our career trajectory, future earnings and future tax rates, we\u2019d simply be able to model whether contributing to our 401(k) on a pretax or Roth basis was best,\u201d said Roger Ma, a financial adviser at lifelaidout. \u201cUnfortunately, we don\u2019t know any of that information.\u201d Financial advisers weighed in on the pros and cons of using Roth accounts over traditional accounts, and what people should consider when deciding between the two. Going for a Roth account People who are in low tax brackets today and expect their earnings to increase in the next few decades would get the most out of a Roth account, Ma said. They would be paying the tax on their contributions today at that low rate and withdrawing the money tax-free when they could potentially be in a higher bracket. Roth accounts are usually best for younger investors, who have not yet reached their peak earning years. \u201cFolks just starting out might have almost 40 years of tax-free growth,\u201d said Thomas Scanlon, an adviser at Raymond James. \u201cWhat a great way to build wealth.\u201d The only people who could really take the advice of choosing a Roth account over a traditional account more seriously are those who are just beginning their careers, those pursuing an early retirement and older retirees who have more than enough money saved for their lifetimes, said Malcolm Ethridge, executive vice president and a financial adviser at CIC Wealth. \u201cOther than that, you really have to dig into that person\u2019s individual financial situation to know whether they would truly reap the benefits of the Roth or if they\u2019d be better served going with a traditional,\u201d he said. Investors can also dip into their Roth IRAs more easily than a traditional account. Roth account holders are allowed to withdraw from their contributions \u2014 not the earnings in those accounts \u2014 at any time because they\u2019ve already paid the taxes on that money. There are separate, more complex, rules around distributions regarding investment earnings, which depend on how many years the account has been opened and the age of the investor at the time of withdrawal. Don\u2019t miss: I\u2019m so confused: How do I treat withdrawals from a Roth IRA? Orman is right in that these tax rates are a deal right now. \u201cThe tax code today is about as favorable as it\u2019s ever been and the likelihood of that changing (to be higher) in the future is pretty good,\u201d said Mark Beaver, a financial adviser at Keeler and Nadler. \u201cBecause of that, we look to add to Roths directly or do things like backdoor Roth contributions or conversions where it makes sense.\u201d Still, using Roth accounts at first depends on each individual situation, and there are times when someone might want to opt for a traditional account in the present day and consider a Roth conversion later on. Sticking with the traditional account Someone who is in a high tax bracket today and expects to be in a lower tax bracket at retirement would get the most out of a traditional account, since the tax rate at the time of withdrawal would be lower, Ma said. Traditional accounts also allow more money to grow over time with compound interest. \u201cGoing from a traditional to Roth is giving up a lot of assets and income,\u201d said Chris Chen, a financial adviser at Insight Financial Strategists. \u201cThe name of the game is not to pay no taxes on distribution, but to minimize taxes over a lifetime.\u201d A Roth IRA also isn\u2019t tax-free, as many Roth advocates tout, it\u2019s just taxed differently, he said. Also see: I\u2019m a 32-year-old stay-at-home mom, and my husband earns $150,000 a year. Will I ever be able to enjoy a retirement? These accounts come with their own sets of advantages. Traditional accounts allow for tax deductions, depending on income, while Roth accounts do not. Therefore, contributions can lower the amount of earnings that are taxable each year. \u201cPretax contributions are one of the few tax reduction strategies many workers have available,\u201d said David Jackson, a financial adviser at Modern Horizons Wealth Advisors. \u201cEspecially now, since fewer are able to itemize because of the increased standard deduction.\u201d Not all plans allow for a Roth option, said Jennifer Weber, vice president of financial planning at Weber Asset Management. \u201cIt\u2019s important to understand the following: what your company offers, does your company offer a match on retirement contributions and are you eligible to contribute directly to a Roth IRA (based on income limits),\u201d she said. Congress could also potentially change the rules around Roth retirement accounts, Dwyer said. The Secure Act, passed in December, had sweeping changes to the retirement industry, and included tweaks about how accounts were taxed and when, such as the stretch IRA. \u201cCongress can get pretty creative about where they are going to collect taxes from and there is no guarantee that they won\u2019t someday go after Roths,\u201d she said. When possible, savers might want to try to have it all \u2014 the traditional type of accounts, the Roth ones and even other taxable investment accounts. Diversification is important, not just in the assets held within these portfolios, but in their taxation. Having various types of accounts to fall back on allows investors to draw down their portfolios at different times depending on their future circumstances, and the tax implications of those scenarios. \u201cBeing diversified is good and can help you effectively manage tax rates in retirement,\u201d said Devin Pope, a partner with Albion Financial Group. \u201cHave some in taxable accounts, tax-deferred and tax-free.\u201d"}]}
