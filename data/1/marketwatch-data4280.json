The prior record ended at 88 days on Feb. 21. We remember well because stocks went into free-fall thereafter. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to paint a doomsday scenario based on a sample size of one, but \u00e2\u0080\u0094 considering the March meltdown \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we should ask: Does this streak bear (pun intended) legitimate stock market risk?Historical perspective To gain objective historical perspective, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve identified the 12 longest rising 20-day SMA streaks for the Nasdaq-100. The individual and average forward performance, once the streak ended, is shown via the chart below. Here is what we learn: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 2020 was the worst-case scenario, but not the only loss. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 The average return one month later was -0.39%. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Three months later, the Nasdaq-100 was down 64% of the time. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Nine and 12 months later, the Nasdaq-100 was up 91% of the time with an average return of 12.99% and 22.95%. This is yet another study to confirm that momentum doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t die easily. I wrote about this on July 14: \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor Nasdaq-rally skeptics, remember that momentum doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t die easily.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The above article featured a monthly Nasdaq chart with a 10-year trend channel and Fibonacci resistance (at 11,332 points).Technical perspective The daily chart below includes the Fibonacci resistance along with some other factors worth considering: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Fibonacci resistance is enhanced by trend-line resistance. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Corresponding Fibonacci resistance for the Invesco QQQ Trust QQQ, +1.52% is at 281.94. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 There was a bearish RSI-35 divergence (price made a new high, but RSI-35 did not) prior to the February 2020 peak. RSI (relative strength index) is a measure of momentum, and a divergence exists when price makes a new high, but RSI does not. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 There exists a bearish RSI-35 divergence between the July 20 and Aug. 6 high. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 There exists an even bigger RSI-35 divergence between the February and August highs. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 The 20-day SMA continues to rise. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Long-term trend-channel resistance, shown in the July 14 article, is around 12,450.Tug of war There is a tug of war between bullish momentum and a potentially bearish technical setup. Investor sentiment has also become a headwind against higher prices. In addition, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% and Russell 2000 RUT, +0.55% have lagged behind the Nasdaq since the March low but outperformed the Nasdaq in August. Apple AAPL, +1.74% \u00c2 and Amazon AMZN, +3.01% are trading above long-term support. The Nasdaq-100 and at least one of the above mega-cap powerhouses will have to fall below support to unlock lower price targets. The Nasdaq has arrived at another potential inflection zone, and even though it has shattered every resistance level on its way here, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good not to become complacent and watch the above-mentioned levels. Interestingly, the S&P 500 and SPDR S&P 500 Trust SPY, +0.89% are within striking distance of their February highs. Over the past 50 years, the S&P 500 lost 30% or more and recovered to within 2% of its prior all-time high only five other times. On average, that round trip (all-time high, 30% or more decline, within 2% of prior all-time high) took 60 months. This time it took only six months. How the S&P 500 performed after having clawed its way back to where it is right now is discussed here. Simon Maierhofer is the founder of iSPYETF and publisher of the Profit Radar Report."}]}
