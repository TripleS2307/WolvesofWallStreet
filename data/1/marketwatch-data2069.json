Tesla shares charged up 11.2% to a record close of $1,835.64, and have rocketed 33.6% in four sessions since the electric vehicle maker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s announced of a 5-for-1 stock split. That marks the eighth time Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stock has produced a rally of more than 30% in four sessions this year. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss: Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stock run leads to 5-1 share split. Good timing, because Ives raised his \u00e2\u0080\u009cbase case\u00e2\u0080\u009d price target to $1,900 from $1,800. Of the 35 analysts surveyed by FactSet, Ives\u00e2\u0080\u0099s target is now only below the $2,400 target of Piper Sandler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Alexander Potter, Oppenheimer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Colin Rusch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s target of $2,209 and the $1,903.97 target of Everbright Securities\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Yu Jing Ni. Ives\u00e2\u0080\u0099s target is well above the average target of $1,235.37, which is 32.7% below Monday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s closing price. Meanwhile, Ives\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cbull case\u00e2\u0080\u009d target is $2,500. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe continue to believe [electric vehicle] demand in China is starting to accelerate in July/August with Tesla competing with a number of domestic and international competitors for market share with Giga 3 remaining the linchpin of success which remains the prize that [Chief Executive Elon] Musk and Tesla are laser focused on capturing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ives wrote in a research note. Giga 3 is the factory Tesla operates in Shanghai. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are seeing more leverage in the story now on the horizon out of Giga 3 along with some price cuts both in the US and China that could further stimulate demand as the macro starts to improve and the lockdown conditions ease globally,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ives wrote. Despite Ives\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bullish call, he still doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t recommend investors buy the stock. He reiterated the neutral rating he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s had Tesla since April 25, 2019. At that time, his price target was $275. Ives expects Tesla to announce a number of new potential \u00e2\u0080\u009cgame changing\u00e2\u0080\u009d battery developments at the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Battery Day event, scheduled for Sept. 22, including a \u00e2\u0080\u009cmillion mile\u00e2\u0080\u009d battery. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn theory, this battery will support an electric vehicle for 1 million miles and be a major step forward when competing versus. traditional gasoline powered automotive competitors from both a [return on investment] and environmental perspective,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ives wrote. Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stock has more than doubled (up 129.7%) over the past three months, while shares of China-based rival Nio Inc. NIO, +0.14% \u00c2 have skyrocketed fourfold (up 316.9%) and the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% \u00c2 has climbed 18.1%. Over the same time, Ives\u00e2\u0080\u0099s price target has more than tripled, as his price target as of May 17 was $600. Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s market capitalization has swelled to $342.02 billion. That is more than triple the combined market caps of auto makers General Motors Co. GM, -0.15% \u00c2 ($42.95 billion), Ford Motor Co. F, -1.36% \u00c2 ($$27.77 billion) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. FCAU, -0.95% \u00c2 ($23.16 billion), and more than 50% above the market cap of Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Toyota Motor Co. TM, -0.65% \u00c2 7203, -0.95% \u00c2 ($221.12 billion). Meanwhile, General Motors\u00c2 shares jumped 7.7% to the highest close since June 8, after Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner pushed for the automaker to spin off its EV business into a separate entity. Rosner, who rates GM a buy, said he was adding the stock to Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s short-term Catalyst Call Buy List. Rosner said he believes an EV spinoff would force the market to recognize its EV technology and upcoming vehicle lineup, \u00e2\u0080\u009cunlock considerable shareholder value,\u00e2\u0080\u009d give the new entity access to cheap capital and provide the new entity with the ability to attract high-caliber talent. GM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stock has gained 32.6% over the past three months, but has dropped 18.0% year to date."}]}
