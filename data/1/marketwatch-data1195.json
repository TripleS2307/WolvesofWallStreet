On Wednesday, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told lawmakers that \"I don't think [decoupling is] a policy or reasonable policy option at this point.\" Lighthizer told House lawmakers that the U.S.-China trade deal is on track. Trump's tweet came a day after excerpts of former national security adviser John Bolton's book were released, including one in which Bolton says Trump asked Chinese President Xi Jinping to buy U.S. farm products in order to help him win agricultural states in the November election."}]}
