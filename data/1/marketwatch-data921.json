MRNA, +0.09% gained 5.2% in trading on Wednesday after a company executive told a government advisory committee that its experimental COVID-19 vaccine had triggered antibodies in elderly patients. Dr. Jacqueline Miller, the company's SVP of infectious disease development, told the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices that neutralizing antibody titers were reported in all age groups that are currently being studied: 18 to 55 years old, 56 to 70 years old, and 71 years and older. \"These data are consistent with our perspective that responses in older patients after mRNA-1273 treatment will likely be in line with what was seen in younger populations,\" SVP Leerink's Mani Foroohar told investors on Wednesday, \"and while safety signals may emerge in larger studies/with longer follow-up, this applies across all age groups.\" This is the first time that Moderna has released data about how its vaccine candidate has performed in an older patient population; the data it shared about how the investigational vaccine fared in the Phase 1 trial was for people between the ages of 18 and 55 years old. Moderna's stock is up 251.2% year-to-date, compared with the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87%, which is up 6.6%."}]}
