TSLA, +1.89% rose 1.3% to end at a record $1,389.86 Tuesday, its sixth straight session of gains. Earlier Tuesday, Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley upped his price target on the shares and came out with a $2,000 \"bull case scenario,\" boosting the stock. As demand for Tesla vehicles continues, the company is on more solid footing than other auto makers and will likely post a GAAP profit when it reports second-quarter results next month, the analyst said. Tesla shares have been on a tear since last week, when the company reported better-than-expected sales numbers even as coronavirus-related closures kept its sole U.S. car-making plant in California shuttered for most of the second quarter."}]}
