I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m astounded that I have not received my payment, especially as I qualified, according to all IRS requirements. I just found out that my parents claimed me as a dependent. As soon as I found this out, I filed my 2019 tax return. However, I fear it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too late for me to receive my $1,200 stimulus check. Is it too late? The tax return deadline for 2019 was extended to July 15, so I assume there are many people like me who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t qualify based on their 2018 return, but do qualify on the 2019 return. When will I receive my stimulus check? Confused son Dispatches from a pandemic: Letter from New York: \u00e2\u0080\u0098New Yorkers wear colorful homemade masks, while nurses wear garbage bags\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Dear Son, Your stimulus payment is an advance on a 2020 tax credit, so you will receive the $1,200. However, it likely won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t arrive until next year or later this year, at the very earliest. By then, we may or may not be in the midst of a second wave of the pandemic. More than 160 million stimulus checks have been sent. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a breakdown, per the House Committee on Ways and Means: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 13 to 18 million taxpayers who file returns below the $2.2 trillion CARES Act income thresholds. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 7.5 million Social Security and Railroad Retirement beneficiaries who do not file tax returns. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 10.7 million taxpayers who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t file tax returns and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t receive federal government benefits. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Millions of Social Security Insurance-only or Veteran Affairs recipients who do not file tax returns. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe IRS also has an estimated 10 million pieces of mail to open and process, including 4.7 million tax returns. Some of these returns may be from first-time filers who would qualify for economic impact payments,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to the House Committee report. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTreasury and the IRS initially estimated that there would be 171 million economic impact payments under the CARES Act, which seems low given the following populations.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss:\u00e2\u0080\u0098We will not have a vaccine by next winter.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Like the 1918 Spanish flu, CDC says second wave of coronavirus could be worse. So what happens now? Having your bank details on file will help speed the plow for a payment next year. If the IRS does not have your bank-account information on file, it will likely take longer. Approximately 14 million Americans, or 6.5% of U.S. households, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have bank accounts. You can submit your bank-account and address information through the IRS tracking tool, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGet My Payment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It should also tell you if the IRS needs more bank-account information.
