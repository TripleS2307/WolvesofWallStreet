(AP) \u2014 Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis extended the state\u2019s voter registration deadline Tuesday after unexpected and unexplained heavy traffic crashed the state\u2019s online system and potentially prevented thousands of enrolling to cast ballots in next month\u2019s presidential election. DeSantis extended the deadline that expired Monday until 7 p.m. Eastern time Tuesday. In addition to online registration, DeSantis ordered elections, motor vehicle and tax collectors offices to stay open until 7 p.m. local time for anyone who wants to register in person. Florida Secretary of State Laurel Lee, who oversees the voting system, said the online registration system \u201cwas accessed by an unprecedented 1.1 million requests per hour\u201d during the last few hours of Monday. Lee said in a statement Tuesday that the state \u201cwill work with our state and federal law-enforcement partners to ensure this was not a deliberate act against the voting process.\u201d The FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency warned elections officials nationwide last week that cyberattacks could disrupt their systems during the run-up to the election. They particularly noted \u201cdistributed denial-of-service\u201d attacks, which inundate a computer system with requests, potentially clogging up servers until the system becomes inaccessible to legitimate users. The potential for outside meddling is an especially sensitive issue in Florida, a key battleground state in November\u2019s election between President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger, former Vice President Joe Biden. The state has lingering questions about Russian hacking during the election four years ago. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019s state has faced lingering questions about Russian hacking during the election four years ago. Getty Images Last year, state officials confirmed that election-related servers of at least two Florida counties were breached by Russian meddlers. No votes or records were tampered with. Whatever caused the disruption, it threw up a roadblock for those trying to register. Sarah Dinkins, a Florida State University student, tried to help her younger sister register Monday night. They began trying about 9 p.m. and by 10:30 p.m. had not been successful. \u201cI feel very frustrated,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the voting website doesn\u2019t work, fewer people potentially Democratic voters will be able to vote.\u201d This is not the first major computer shutdown to affect the state government this year. For weeks in the spring, tens of thousands of Floridians who lost their jobs because of the coronavirus pandemic couldn\u2019t file for unemployment benefits because of repeated crashes by that overwhelmed computer system, delaying their payments. DeSantis replaced the director overseeing that system but blamed the problems on his predecessor, fellow Republican Rick Scott, who is now a U.S. senator. Democrats jumped on the latest issue, saying it and the unemployment fiasco show that the DeSantis administration is inept and accused it of trying to stop people from voting. \u201cThe utter incompetence of Gov. Ron DeSantis in allowing the state\u2019s voter registration website to crash on the very last day to register for the upcoming November election is, sadly, completely believable,\u201d U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz said. \u201cHis administrative buffoonery in operating the state\u2019s unemployment system telegraphed today\u2019s executive ineptitude. However, this particular blunder intimates a continuing pattern of voter suppression that the governor has become notorious for.\u201d A civil rights group had threatened to sue if the governor did not extend the deadline. The Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law said the breakdown would unjustly deprive thousands of casting ballots for president and other offices. Kristen Clarke, the group\u2019s president, said the group sued Virginia in 2016 after its computer system crashed just before the deadline, winning an extension that allowed thousands of additional voters to register. __ Spencer reported from Fort Lauderdale.
