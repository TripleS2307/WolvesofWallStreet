CRM, +2.21% \u00c2 , but the swap also says a lot about the energy sector. Exxon XOM, -1.47% \u00c2 stock traded as low as $41.27, on pace for its largest percent decrease in a week. The stock is down six of the past seven sessions, and down 41% year-to-date, which compares with losses around 1.3% for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. DJIA, +0.56% \u00c2 Exxon shares were the second worst performer in the Dow on Tuesday. Exxon has been on the 30-component, price-weighted index since 1928, as then the Standard Oil of New Jersey before its various iterations and the 1999 Exxon and Mobil merger. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMinor\u00e2\u0080\u009d selling was to be expected from the change, as the Dow is not commonly used as a benchmark for actively managed funds, analyst Jennifer Rowland with Edward Jones said. Removing the company from the index, however, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis symbolic of just how far the energy sector has fallen over the past several years.\u00e2\u0080\u009d See also:Opinion: Exxon getting booted from the Dow Jones Industrial Average may be a blessing in disguise for its investors \u00e2\u0080\u009cGoing forward, (Chevron Corp. CVX, -1.62% ) will be the only energy stock on the DJIA. In the S&P 500, there are 5 stocks (Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.74%, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +2.48%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +3.01%, Alphabet Inc. GOOG, +1.97% \u00c2 GOOGL, +1.82%, \u00c2 and Facebook Inc. FB, +0.26% ) that are individually larger than the entire U.S. energy sector \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty sobering,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. S&P Dow Jones Indices announced the changes, effective Aug. 31, late Monday. Exxon as well as Pfizer Inc. PFE, -0.27% \u00c2 and Raytheon Technologies Corp. RTX, -1.46% \u00c2 will be out, the latter two replaced by biotech drugmaker Amgen Inc. AMGN, -1.41% \u00c2 and industrial conglomerate Honeywell International Inc. HON, +0.34% \u00c2 S&P Dow Jones said the changes were prompted by Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to carry out a 4-for-1 stock split, reducing the index\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tech-sector weighting.

The analysts rate Exxon stock a hold, reflecting the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going further into debt to finance its dividend and pressure in key segments like refining, they said. The energy sector was the worst-hit sector on the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% \u00c2 on Tuesday, down nearly 2%. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt a time when energy is a mere 2.5% of the S&P 500\u00e2\u0080\u0099s market cap, it seems incongruous that two oil and gas supermajors have been part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said in a note Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, the powers that be at S&P Dow Jones Indices have finally addressed this anomaly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Energy companies have battled twin shocks of years of oversupply and wrecked demand from the coronavirus pandemic. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s alongside ongoing concerns about an eventual peak in oil demand, which has emerged before the pandemic, and ESG-related objections to fossil fuels, Molchanov said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor the record, our view on the oil market is more upbeat, and as such as we envision room for, on the whole, a healthy recovery in oil-levered equities into 2021, especially the latter half of the year,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. As to why Exxon and not Chevron is being removed, it may stem from the fact that Chevron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s share price is twice as high, since the DJIA incorporates share price in its weightings. But that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unlikely to be the only reason, he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFundamentally, Chevron is positioned much more straightforwardly as an oil producer: a high degree of operating leverage to commodity prices, and by contrast limited exposure to refining and almost none to chemicals,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe index committee probably wanted to maintain some oil exposure, making Chevron the better choice to do so, especially given that chemical giant Dow Inc. DOW, -0.04% \u00c2 ... already represents the chemical industry in the index.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}]}
