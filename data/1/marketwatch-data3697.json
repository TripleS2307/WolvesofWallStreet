Associated Press President Donald Trump confirmed on Tuesday that the administration was using the Defense Production Act to provide a $765 million loan to support Eastman Kodak\u2019s efforts to produce active ingredients needed to make generic drugs in the U.S. \u201cToday\u2019s action is our latest step to build the greatest medical arsenal in history,\u201d Trump said. Eastman Kodak KODK, +12.98% stock popped 203% Tuesday after the Wall Street Journal first reported the loan. Eastman Kodak shares rose another 63% in after-hours trading. The president appeared for about 30 minutes during Tuesday\u2019s coronavirus task force briefing at the White House. He spent much of his time touting the administration\u2019s efforts to deliver supplies, improve coronavirus testing and replenish the national stockpile of personal protective equipment. He said that the combined efforts of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the private sector have procured 20 billion surgical gloves, 34 million face shields, 1 billion N95 and surgical masks, and 354 million surgical gowns. When asked if he supports Senate Republicans\u2019 proposed $1 trillion stimulus bill, Trump pointed to the need to have further discussions with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Trump asked all Americans to practice social distancing, remain vigilant about hygiene, and avoid indoor and large gatherings. He also said to wear a mask wherever appropriate. But when asked about a video he shared on Twitter, which has since been removed from social media sites for promoting COVID-19 misinformation, Trump questioned why the video was removed. \u201cI think they\u2019re very respected doctors,\u201d he said, referring to doctors in the video that touted the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 patients. \u201cThere was a woman who was spectacular in her statements about it.\u201d When a reporter noted the woman he referred to, Dr. Stella Immanuel, has reportedly made outlandish comments, including that alien DNA is used in medicine, Trump said, \u201cI thought her voice was an important voice, but I know nothing about her.\u201d When asked if he\u2019ll be speaking in Charlotte, N.C., for the Republican National Convention, Trump said his speech will take place on Aug. 27, but did not divulge the location. Last week he canceled the Jacksonville, Fla., leg of the convention, which would have hosted party festivities, including his speech. Trump said delegates will still meet in Charlotte on Aug. 24, but said the White House will announce plans for his speech soon. Trump also defended his reportedly tense relationship with Dr. Anthony Fauci, pointing out that the doctor works for the administration. He also referenced Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx\u2019s high approval ratings, jokingly contrasting them to his. \u201cThey\u2019re highly thought of, but nobody likes me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can only be my personality.\u201d"}]}
