Speaking on national news radio station LBC, Hancock said the government has already started production of the U.K. government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s initial order of 30 million doses of its coronavirus vaccine, which is being developed by pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca AZN, +1.16% \u00c2 in collaboration with the University of Oxford. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have got 30 million doses already contracted with AstraZeneca, in fact they are starting to manufacture those doses already, ahead of approval, so that should approval come through \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still not certain but it is looking up \u00e2\u0080\u0094 should that approval come through, then we are ready to roll out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hancock told LBC. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe best-case scenario is that happens this year. I think more likely is the early part of next year \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in the first few months of next year is the most likely,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. U.S. President Donald Trump is reportedly considering plans to fast-track approval of AstraZeneca\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vaccine in a bid to make it available to Americans before November\u00e2\u0080\u0099s election. The vaccine hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been approved for use and is still undergoing late-stage clinical trials in the U.K., Brazil and South Africa. Read:AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine heads to late-stage study Hancock\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments come after the U.K. recorded a surge in the number of people testing positive for coronavirus. On Sunday, a further 2,988 cases of coronavirus were reported in the country, the highest number reported on a single day since May 22, and a rise of 1,175 on Saturday, according to the U.K. government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coronavirus dashboard. Two deaths were recorded within 28 days of a positive COVID-19 test in the previous 24 hours, taking the total to 41,551, the government said. The rise in cases prompted Professor Gabriel Scally, a former National Health Service regional director of public health for the south west, to tell the Guardian that the government had \u00e2\u0080\u009clost control of the virus.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hancock on Monday denied the government was losing control, but said that this weekend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rise in cases was \u00e2\u0080\u009cconcerning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He urged younger people to adhere to social distancing measures, saying that under-25s, particularly those aged 17 to 21, accounted for a large number of positive cases. The spike in cases comes as people are returning to work and school, and as universities prepare to reopen. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is concerning because we have seen a rise in cases in France, in Spain, in some other countries across Europe \u00e2\u0080\u0094 nobody wants to see a second wave here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hancock told LBC. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt just reinforces the point that people must follow the social distancing rules, they are so important,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, adding, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also bought vaccine ahead of it getting approved from a whole different series of international vaccines as well.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Read:U.K. strikes two COVID-19 vaccine deals for 90 million doses In August, the U.K. announced that it will buy 90 million doses of potential COVID-19 vaccines from Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +1.39% \u00c2 and U.S. drug developer Novavax NVAX, +0.18%. Some people with coronavirus are being asked to travel hundreds of miles to get tested, according to the BBC. Labour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, on Sunday tweeted that the increase in COVID cases is \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeeply worrying\u00e2\u0080\u009d and demanded Hancock give a statement to the House of Commons to explain the increase in cases and why some people are still being told to drive hundreds of miles to have a test."}]}
