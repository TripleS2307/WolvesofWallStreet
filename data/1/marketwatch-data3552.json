Have stay-at-home orders changed U.S. shopping habits? \u201cWith the increased financial pressure and job insecurity, many consumers will redistribute their spending or saving in certain areas,\u201d a new analysis by Nielsen found. \u201cOn the basis of observations in previous crisis situations and consumer surveys, we believe that changes in spending patterns will particularly affect the areas of fashion, take-away, travel/holidays and replacement purchases.\u201d \u201c The hoarding at grocery stores appears to have eased, for now at least. \u201d For starters, consumers may be planning more road trips this summer instead of air travel. U.S. retail sales jumped by 17.7% in May, the government said this week. Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast an 8.5% increase. Sales at auto dealers soared 44%; excluding cars, overall retail sales increased by 12.4%; the auto sector generally accounts for one-fifth of all retail spending. The hoarding at grocery stores appears to have eased, for now at least. Grocery sales rose 1.3% in sales after a record 14.4% spike in April. Due to the lockdown of businesses in most states, health and personal care \u2014 including pharmacies, salons and barbers \u2014 ticked up just 0.4%. It remains to be seen whether people will be rushing back to salons, or if they will stick to social-distancing rules.

Sales soared 188% at clothing stores, 90% at home-furnishing stores and 88% at stores that sell books, music and sporting goods, a significant rebound from April and March. Target, among other big-box stores in the U.S., saw \u201ca rapid increase in traffic and sales\u201d for discretionary goods driven by the distribution of stimulus checks, CEO Brian Cornell said in a conference last month. \u201cWe certainly saw an uptick as we reported starting on April 15, as those checks arrived across America,\u201d he added.
