UBER, -0.18% ran up 9.4% in premarket trading Monday, after the ride-hailing giant confirmed a deal to buy food-delivery service Postmates Inc. for $2.65 billion in stock. Uber estimates that it will issue about 84 million shares of its common stock, representing about 4.8% of the shares outstanding, for 100% of Postmates's equity. After the deal's closing, which is expected in the first quarter of 2021, Uber plans to keep Postmates's app running separately from its own food-delivery service app Uber Eats. \"Uber and Postmates have long shared a belief that platforms like ours can power much more than just food delivery-they can be a hugely important part of local commerce and communities, all the more important during crises like COVID-19,\" said Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi. Bloomberg and the New York Times reported over the weekend that a deal was expected to be announced as early as Monday. Uber's stock has gained 3.2% year to date through Thursday, while shares of rival Lyft Inc. LYFT, +2.16% has dropped 26.0% and the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% has lost 3.1%."}]}
