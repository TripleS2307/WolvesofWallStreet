The London-listed industrial turnaround specialist said that for the six months ended June 30 revenue fell by 27%, and that it expects to make a small adjusted operating profit in the period. Adjusted operating profit is a metric which strips out exceptional and other one-off items. The company said that aerospace sales for the period fell by about 18% and that they aren't expected to recover in the second half. Melrose said aerospace sales for 2020 are likely to fall by 25% to 30% year-on-year, and for the business to broadly break even. The company said a substantial reduction of the aerospace cost structure is under way. Sales in the company's automotive and powder metallurgy business for the second quarter fell 36%."}]}
