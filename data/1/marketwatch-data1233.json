But is he serious?", "body": "Negotiations between the European Union and the U.K. about their future trade relations enter the last chance saloon on Tuesday, as both sides meet for yet another round of talks one day after U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson threatened to walk out if a deal isn\u2019t struck by October 15. - The two sides failed to make any progress over the summer and remain stuck on the question of what type of \u201clevel playing field\u201d the U.K. should accept, to reassure Europe it won\u2019t undercut it on matters such as labor or environment regulations. The economically minor problem of fisheries, and who will be able to trawl in British waters, has also proven a serious bone of contention. - The U.K.\u2019s top government lawyer, Jonathan Jones, quit on Tuesday over Johnson\u2019s intention to renege on parts of the \u201cpolitical declaration\u201d the country signed with the EU last year along with a \u201cwithdrawal agreement\u201d in the run-up to Brexit. The deal, which has the legal strength of an international treaty, aimed at avoiding that a new border be erected between the U.K.\u2019s Northern Ireland region and the Republic of Ireland. - British industrial lobbies have warned in recent weeks that the U.K. government has failed to take the necessary steps to avoid a massive logistical problem at the border if the two sides failed to clinch a deal. Major disruptions are also expected in industrial supply chains or food imports. - The long-term cost of a no-deal Brexit for the U.K. economy would amount to some 5.7% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product, far higher than the coronavirus impact, which will cut gross domestic product by 2.1%, according to a recent London School of Economics paper. - The pound GBPUSD, +0.83% fell more than 1% against the dollar on Tuesday on fears about no-deal Brexit. The UK currencyis down by nearly 3% since the beginning of the month.

But both sides are ramping up their preparations for the worst-case, no-deal Brexit scenario. Meanwhile, Johnson is facing another political crisis within his own camp, more divided than ever between the far-right Brexiteers and the more moderate Tories.
