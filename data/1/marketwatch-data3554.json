Getty Images for Bustle Is the rotation for real? In recent trading sessions, investors have moved toward beaten-down stocks in sectors that only stand to gain if an economic recovery is truly underway, and away from the pricey tech names that have flown high all year. Many observers believe that shift \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a so-called value rotation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is finally at hand, signaling that markets have confidence in the durability of the recovery. Not J.P.Morgan equity analysts. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWithin our medium term preference for Growth and Defensives, we argued that any rebound in Value style, such as the one we called for on\u00c2 18th May\u00c2 due to the expected PMI rebound, will not be able to sustain beyond a few weeks\u00e2\u0080\u009d wrote the team, \u00c2 led by Mislav Matejka, in a Sunday research note. The rotation head fakes that characterize the recovery from the March market mayhem are familiar to many investors, but Matejka and his team note that the last rotation that lasted longer than just a few weeks was in 2016-2017, a very different economic and market backdrop than the current moment. At that time, they write, U.S. bond yields surged \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it was called the \u00e2\u0080\u009creflation trade\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093 taking the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.777% from 1.5% to 3.2%. The dollar was declining, China was stimulating its economy, the global economic landscape was brightening, and tax cuts \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not increases \u00e2\u0080\u0093 were on the horizon. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese catalysts, rather than the extreme positioning or cheap valuations, facilitated the rotation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the analysts write. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe latter are never enough.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It may go without saying that conditions could hardly be more different now. Tax increases seem more likely than cuts. Bond yields are \u00e2\u0080\u009cstuck in a range,\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the words of the J.P.Morgan analysts, and if anything seem more likely to deflate than rise. They also believe that the dollar may not weaken further, although some analysts disagree. China is being cautious with its stimulus \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and an added wrinkle that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exist back in 2016-2017 is the rising trade tensions between it and the U.S. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor these reasons, among other, we held a view that market leadership will be Growth and Defensives driven this year, both in the selloff and in the subsequent market recovery, beyond a few tactical Value snapbacks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they write. Time will tell if the current moment is such a \u00e2\u0080\u009csnapback,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or a more enduring transition. As of Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% had gained nearly 8% in the month to date, the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% was up nearly 6% \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39% index, which had seemed indestructible through most of 2020, was up only 2.6%. All were trounced by the Russell 2000 RUT, +0.55%, an index of smaller company stocks.
