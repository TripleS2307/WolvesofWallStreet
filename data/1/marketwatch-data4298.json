These subsidiaries of Wirecard\u2019s were the entities not only generating most of the profit, but they were the subsidiaries where the cash balances were mostly held.\u201d Wirecard\u2019s chief executive, Markus Braun, resigned on Friday. Norris hasn\u2019t let the Wirecard experience deter him from buying stocks more generally. He pointed out coronavirus is mostly impacting the elderly and not the general population. \u201cWhen we realize the nature of the virus wasn\u2019t another Spanish flu, then the rationale for the lockdown forever, or until we find a vaccine, has completely disappeared, and then we should get back to normal economic activity,\u201d he said. With his view of the virus, it\u2019s \u201calmost impossible\u201d to be bearish, he said. \u201cThe last time I\u2019ve felt this bullish was 2009, when you had similar once-in-a-decade opportunities,\u201d he said. Norris said he is now looking at recovery plays, after having invested in the likes of Amazon AMZN, +3.01%, Netflix NFLX, +1.43% and Zoom Video Communications ZM, +2.89% in the first quarter. \u201cI just look at them now and I think, if we\u2019re going to be locked down forever, maybe these are going to be good investments, but I just think that I struggle to see where the incremental buyer for those stocks is going to come from in the short term.\u201d He likes U.K. home builders, semiconductor makers \u2014 Micron Technology MU, -0.02% was his biggest long position in May \u2014 and recently bought plane maker Airbus AIR, -0.20% for the first time in four years. \u201cWhereas people don\u2019t really like commuting or going to the office, they do like going on a holiday,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that aerospace is an industry that is going to come roaring back when the truth about the virus comes out.\u201d He also likes reinsurance stocks, including Swiss Re SREN, -0.62% and Reinsurance Group of America RGA, +1.17%, on expectations they will increase prices after enduring a short-term earnings hit. \u201cHistorically, the one time when you buy reinsurance is when share prices are halved, because they\u2019re going to take a hit, but they always recover when pricing goes up.\u201d Exercise bike company Peloton PTON, +6.97% is one he was short before the lockdown, went long afterward, and now is back to being short. \u201cNearly every fitness trend has been a fad. Going back to the hula hoop, Jane Fonda videos, it has never lasted,\u201d he said. The lockdown was great for Peloton, but its business model relies on users to keep their subscriptions for 10 years, he said. \u201cThe market cap is now absurd relative to the long-term profit potential,\u201d he said.
