GM, -0.15% shares to buy from neutral.

For example, the electric car maker cut pricing by 5-6% on its Model 3, S and X's and delivery lead times for the Model Y have dropped, said the bank. As for GM, analysts said they see 36% upside to a revised 12-month price target of $36 (from $25 prior). And the automaker has met their \"rule of 3\" on when to buy cyclical stocks -- trough margins, management capitulation and signs of life on the horizon.
