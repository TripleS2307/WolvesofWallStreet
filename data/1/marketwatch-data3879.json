(AP Photo/Beth J. Harpaz, File) Published credit: Beth Harpaz/Associated Press Beth Harpaz/Associated Press The Department of Justice accused Yale University of discriminating against Asian-Americans and white applicants in its admissions process Thursday. The accusation is the latest flashpoint in a decades-long battle over the role of race in evaluating applicants for spots at top colleges, but it likely won\u2019t immediately impact colleges\u2019 approach to building their classes. It also comes amid years of pressure directed at top colleges to better serve Black, Hispanic and other students from underrepresented groups. The Department of Justice\u2019s findings come two years after the agency opened an investigation into Yale\u2019s admissions practices. In a four-page letter to the school, Eric Dreiband, an assistant attorney general in the Civil Rights Division, wrote that Yale \u201cgrants substantial, and often determinative, preferences based on race.\u201d \u201cYale\u2019s race discrimination imposes undue and unlawful penalties on racially-disfavored applicants, including in particular Asian American and White applicants,\u201d the letter reads. The letter comes amid a slew of legal battles over the role of race in college admissions. Lawsuits against Harvard University and the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill over the schools\u2019 admissions practices are winding their way through the court system and could make their way to the Supreme Court. California legislators voted earlier this summer to put the question to voters of whether to repeal the state\u2019s ban on affirmative action in the hiring of public employees, awarding public contracts and admissions to public universities in the state. The DOJ\u2019s findings are based on interpretations of earlier Supreme Court precedent and so they don\u2019t change the landscape, at least not immediately, for how Yale or any other school will vet applicants, experts say. The letter is also in line with the Trump administration\u2019s approach to the use of race in admissions; the DOJ filed a friend of the court brief earlier this year in support of the groups challenging Harvard\u2019s admissions policies. If Yale and the agency can\u2019t come to some sort of agreement in two weeks, the DOJ is prepared to file a lawsuit, the letter reads. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot here that suggests this is a very thinly veiled political lob at a moment in time,\u201d said Art Coleman, managing partner at Education Counsel, an education consulting firm. There\u2019s not much evidence in the letter underlying the agency\u2019s conclusion, Coleman, who worked in the Department of Education\u2019s office of Civil Rights, said. Yale officials echoed that sentiment. The school\u2019s President, Peter Salovey, called the agency\u2019s allegation \u201cbaseless,\u201d in a statement. He said that the school has been cooperating with DOJ, but that the agency \u201cconcluded its investigation before reviewing and receiving all the information it has requested.\u201d \u201cGiven our university\u2019s commitment to complying with federal law, I am dismayed that the DOJ inexplicably rushed to conclude its investigation without conducting a fully informed analysis, which would have shown that Yale\u2019s practices absolutely comply with decades of Supreme Court precedent,\u201d he said.Supreme Court set a precedent on the role of race in admissions That precedent allows colleges to consider race only as part of a broader goal of achieving educational diversity. In addition, schools can only weigh race as part of a holistic evaluation process that considers many factors \u2014 strategies such as quota systems are effectively banned. One result of that approach is that the college admissions process, particularly at top schools, is \u201cvery opaque,\u201d said Richard Ralph Banks, a professor at Stanford Law School. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to tell why people got in or didn\u2019t get in,\u201d he said. Typically, we expect transparency from public or public facing institutions, he said, \u201cbut here the Supreme Court flips that.\u201d Instead of allowing schools to assign points or other clear value to particular criteria, the law requires that schools evaluate candidates holistically and share little about the weight they place on various factors, he said. \u201cIt tells the people who are doing the thing that\u2019s transparent you can\u2019t do that and it tells the people who are doing the thing that\u2019s opaque, that\u2019s what you must do,\u201d said Banks \u201cIt\u2019s kind of odd, but that\u2019s the law.\u201d He said it\u2019s possible that colleges\u2019 general counsels may be going over their admissions\u2019 practices in the wake of Thursday\u2019s letter and documenting clearly that \u201cwhat we\u2019re doing is consistent with what the Court said we can do.\u201d That way, \u201cif the Justice Department as we have right now is hostile to affirmative action and would try to initiate some enforcement action, the university is in a pretty good space.\u201dLetter offers a signal to legal strategy The agency\u2019s letter does offer a signal that DOJ is using a legal strategy similar to other litigants who have challenged affirmative action, Coleman said. He points to this statement from the letter as an indication: \u201cThe likelihood of admission for Asian American and White applicants who have similar academic credentials is significantly lower than for African American and Hispanic applicants to Yale College.\u201d That framing, Coleman said, concludes \u201cas a premise for the litigation that test scores and grades equal merit and we know definitively that\u2019s not true. The whole notion of holistic review is about contextualization and the intersection of factors to make judgement.\u201d And indeed, the role of test scores and other more \u201ctraditional\u201d admissions criteria, which often correspond with wealth and whiteness, has come under fire over the past several years as elite colleges face pressure to better serve Black, Hispanic and other students from groups that have historically been largely absent from these campuses. In Yale\u2019s class of 2023, 20% of students receive a Pell grant, the money the government provides to low-income students to attend college. In that class, 11.8% of students are African-American, 25.9% are Asian-American and 49.3% are white. Roughly 12% of the class of 2023 \u2014 which had a 6.2% admissions rate \u2014 have a legacy affiliation. The college admissions scandal last year highlighted the advantages white, wealthy and well-connected students often have in the admissions process. Inequities in kindergarten through 12th grade schooling as well as a dearth of access to expensive test preparation courses and extracurricular activities have meant that well-resourced schools, like Yale, tend to serve a relatively small percentage of the nation\u2019s poorest students. At the same time, schools that serve a wider swath of Black, Hispanic and low-income students, often have less money at their disposal to get these students to and through college. The DOJ\u2019s findings are a \u201cshallow attempt\u201d at undermining access to higher education and the \u201cstrides that we have made,\u201d in increasing access to college for groups that have historically been underrepresented on campuses, said Anthony Abraham Jack, an assistant professor at Harvard Graduate School of Education. \u201cIt\u2019s despicable,\u201d in the broader context of what the college admissions scandal revealed about the role of money in higher education, that the government would target the inclusion of race in the admissions process instead of addressing the impact of policies borne out of systemic racism, like redlining, on educational equity, Jack said. \u201cYou are going after really the one policy aimed at attempting to level the playing field, to give individuals whose SAT scores are not inflated by social class and other privileges that being rich and being white provide in America,\u201d said Jack, the author of \u201cThe Privileged Poor: How Elite Colleges are Failing Disadvantaged Students.\u201d The inequity among students and between colleges could be exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic, as students without a safe home to study in, or with family members who have lost their jobs or health are at risk of having their progress towards a degree disrupted, while colleges worry about a drop off in enrollment \u2014 a metric that is key to their financial health. The debate over Yale\u2019s admissions policy presents a sort of \u201ccounterpoint of that,\u201d Banks said. The case \u201cjust kind of shows how sought after they are.\u201d"}]}
