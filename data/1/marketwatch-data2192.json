(AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Federal law-enforcement officers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 actions at protests in Oregon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest city, undertaken without local authorities\u00e2\u0080\u0099 consent, are raising the prospect of a constitutional crisis \u00e2\u0080\u0094 one that could escalate as weeks of demonstrations find renewed focus in clashes with camouflaged, unidentified agents outside Portland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s U.S. courthouse. State and local authorities, who did not ask for federal help, are awaiting a ruling in a federal lawsuit filed late last week by Oregon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attorney general, Ellen Rosenblum. She said in court papers that masked federal officers have arrested people off the street, far from the courthouse, with no probable cause \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and whisked them away in unmarked cars.

The Chicago Tribune, citing anonymous sources, reported Monday that Trump planned to deploy 150 federal agents to Chicago. The ACLU of Oregon has sued in federal court over the agents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 presence in Portland, and the organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Chicago branch said it would similarly oppose a federal presence. Zolan Kanno-Youngs, a homeland-security reporter at the New York Times, said he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d confirmed the Tribune report, tweeting that the Trump administration was set to deploy 150 Homeland Security investigations agents to Chicago for 60 days to combat \u00e2\u0080\u009cgang violence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d with other federal agents also expected to be deployed. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to have more federal law enforcement, that I can tell you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump had said earlier Monday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn Portland, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done a fantastic job. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been there three days and they really have done a fantastic job in a very short period of time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d An official White House communication, via Twitter, said that \u00e2\u0080\u009cDemocrat mayors of Portland, Chicago, and New York are letting their cities fall to violence and chaos\u00e2\u0080\u009d: iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Top leaders in the U.S. House said Sunday they were \u00e2\u0080\u009calarmed\u00e2\u0080\u009d by the Trump administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tactics in Portland and beyond. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve called on federal inspectors general to investigate. See:Top House Democrats \u00e2\u0080\u0098alarmed\u00e2\u0080\u0099 by federal tactics against Portland protesters Trump, who called the protesters \u00e2\u0080\u009canarchists and agitators\u00e2\u0080\u009d in a Sunday tweet, said the agents, with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department, are on hand to help Portland and restore order at the Mark O. Hatfield Federal Courthouse. The actions run counter to the usual philosophies of American conservatives, who typically treat state and local rights with great sanctity and have long been deeply wary of the federal government \u00e2\u0080\u0094 particularly its armed agents \u00e2\u0080\u0094 interceding in most situations. But Trump, a Republican, has shown during his time in office that his actions do not always reflect traditional conservatism \u00e2\u0080\u0094 particularly when politics, and in this case an impending election, are in play. Militarized federal agents deployed by the president to Portland, Ore., fired tear gas against protesters overnight Friday as the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mayor demanded that the agents be removed and as the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attorney general vowed to seek a restraining order against them. The Oregonian via AP One prominent Republican, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who is from the libertarian-leaning flank of the party, came out publicly against the federal agents. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe cannot give up liberty for security. Local law enforcement can and should be handling these situations in our cities but there is no place for federal troops or unidentified federal agents rounding people up at will,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Paul said in a tweet Monday. The protests now gaining nationwide attention have roiled Portland for 52 nights, ever since George Floyd died after being pinned by the neck for nearly eight minutes by a white Minneapolis police officer. Many rallies have attracted thousands and been largely peaceful. But smaller groups of up to several hundred people have focused on federal property and local law enforcement buildings, at times setting fires to police precincts, smashing windows and clashing violently with local police. The Portland Police Bureau used tear gas on multiple occasions until a federal court order banned its officers from doing so without declaring a riot. Now, concern is growing that the tear gas is being used against demonstrators by federal officers instead. Anger at the federal presence escalated on July 11, when a protester who was hospitalized with critical injuries after a U.S. Marshals Service officer struck him in the head with a non-lethal round. Video of the incident shows the man, identified as Donavan LaBella, standing across the street from the officers holding a speaker over his head with both hands when he was struck. Affidavits filed in federal court in cases against recently arrested protesters also show that federal officers have posted lookouts on the upper stories of the courthouse and have plainclothes officers circulating in the crowd. Court papers in one case \u00e2\u0080\u0094 against a man arrested on federal charges for shining a green laser in the eyes of Federal Protective Service agents \u00e2\u0080\u0094 show that Portland police turned him over to federal authorities after federal officers identified him, in part with the testimony of their undercover officers. Mayor Ted Wheeler, who himself has been under fire locally for his handling of the protests, said Sunday on national TV talk shows that the demonstrations that dominated Portland headlines for more than seven weeks were dwindling before federal officers engaged. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are sharply escalating the situation. Their presence here is actually leading to more violence and more vandalism. And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not helping the situation at all,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wheeler said Sunday on CNN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cState of the Union.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not wanted here. We haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t asked them here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wheeler said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn fact, we want them to leave.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Indeed, crowds of demonstrators had begun to dwindle a week ago, and some people in notoriously liberal Portland \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including Black community leaders \u00e2\u0080\u0094 had begun to call for the nightly demonstrations to end. But by the weekend, the presence of federal troops and Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s repeated references to Portland as a hotbed of \u00e2\u0080\u009canarchists\u00e2\u0080\u009d seemed to give a new life and renewed focus to the nightly demonstrations \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and to attract a broader base. On Sunday night, a crowd estimated at more than 500 people gathered outside the courthouse and included dozens of self-described \u00e2\u0080\u009cmoms\u00e2\u0080\u009d who linked arms in a line in front of a chain link fence in front of the courthouse. The demonstration continued into Monday morning. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt seems clear that there were at least some federal crimes committed here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Steve Vladeck, a constitutional-law professor at the University of Texas. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the notion that a handful of federal crimes justifies a substantial deployment of federal law enforcement officers \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 to show force on the streets is, to my mind, unprecedented.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cFederal law enforcement,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Vladeck said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis not a political prop.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}]}
