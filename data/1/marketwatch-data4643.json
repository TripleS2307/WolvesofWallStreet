MMM, +0.94% dropped 2.2% in premarket trading Tuesday, after the diversified maker of health care, consumer and industrial products reported second-quarter profit and sales that missed expectations, as results were \"significantly impacted\" by the COVID-19 pandemic. Net income rose to $1.29 billion, or $2.22 a share, from $1.13 billion, or $1.92 a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share fell 16% to $1.78, below the FactSet consensus of $1.81. Sales dropped 12% to $7.18 billion, missing the FactSet consensus $7.32 billion. Safety and industrial sales declined 9.2% to $2.7 billion, above the FactSet consensus of $2.62 billion; health care sales slipped 0.4% to $1.8 billion to miss expectations of $1.95 billion; transportation and electronics sales dropped 20.9% to $1.9 billion to miss expectations of $1.97 billion; and consumer sales fell 6.2% to $1.2 billion, in line with expectations of $1.22 billion. The company said it is still not able to provide financial guidance given uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic. For July to date, 3M said sales are tracking up in the low-single digit percentage range from last year. The stock has lost 7.5% year to date through Monday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% has slipped 6.9%. (This replaces an earlier item that incorrectly reported the relationship between reported safety and industrial sales and analyst expectations)."}]}
