Driftwell will roll out online first and then head to select retail shelves in the first quarter of 2021, a strategy chosen to drive interest in the product before it hits stores, the company said. Developed through an internal pitch competition in 2019 and launched in less than a year, Driftwell contains L-theanine. Theanine is also found in tea and is used to ease anxiety and improve mental function. Driftwell also has a \u201cspa-water inspired flavor\u201d of BlackBerry and lavender. Driftwell isn\u2019t carbonated and doesn\u2019t contain sugar or calories.

PepsiCo PEP, +0.42% says Driftwell was in development before COVID-19, though recognizes the need during the pandemic. \u201cRelaxation and dealing with stress is a lifestyle shift,\u201d according to a statement from PepsiCo. Over-the-counter sleep aids are a $1 billion market with a more than 9.5% four-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR), according to data provided by PepsiCo. Driftwell falls into what PepsiCo calls an \u201cemergent\u201d category, which means it could be placed in a variety of places throughout the grocery store, including health and beauty. \u201cWhile PepsiCo ultimately envisions relaxation beverages owning a space similar to the energy category today, how that grows will largely depend on how consumers look for them and the brands\u2019 ability to react to that shopping behavior,\u201d the company said. Beverage companies are exploring a broader set of categories and ingredients for their drinks to grow. This year, Coca-Cola Co.

Other coming launches from Molson-Coors include MadVine, a plant-based diet soda with ingredients like bourbon vanilla and yuzu lemon; and Golden Wing, a grain-based milk alternative with proteins and nutrients. \u201cWe\u2019re following through on our promise to seek out new opportunities beyond beer, and we\u2019ll continue to innovate and move into new spaces as it\u2019s an important part of our long-term strategy,\u201d said Pete Marino, president of emerging growth for Molson Coors, in a statement.
