The actress best known for \u00e2\u0080\u009cBasic Instinct\u00e2\u0080\u009d revealed on Instagram FB, +0.26% \u00c2 over the weekend that her sister and brother-in-law are fighting for their lives in Montana after being diagnosed with COVID-19. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more, her grandmother and godmother have both died from the coronavirus. So in a followup video posted to her Instagram page on Sunday, Stone, 62, called on her followers to vote for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his vice presidential pick, Kamala Harris, which is \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe only thing that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gonna change\u00e2\u0080\u009d the coronavirus health crisis in the U.S. And while she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t name President Donald Trump by name, she laid the more than 170,000 Americans who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve died from COVID-19 since March (or more than 200,000 already, by the New York Times\u00e2\u0080\u0099 count) at his feet. \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u009cPlease vote. And please, whatever you do, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t vote for a killer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u201d Stone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s emotional 3\u00c2\u00bd-minute video described how her sister Kelly had lupus before being diagnosed with COVID-19, meaning she was immunocompromised and vulnerable to the coronavirus. Kelly and her husband had quarantined at home, supposedly only venturing out to go to the pharmacy. But they still got sick, which Stone blamed on \u00e2\u0080\u009cone of you non-mask wearers\u00e2\u0080\u009d in her previous Instagram post. She called out the people \u00e2\u0080\u009ccarrying guns\u00e2\u0080\u009d while protesting their \u00e2\u0080\u009cfreedom\u00e2\u0080\u009d not to wear masks. She also blamed Montana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s testing policy, noting one must show symptoms of the virus in order to get tested, and test results can take five days to return \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop asymptomatic spread.

People are dying and fighting for their lives, because there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing but lies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Her post drew support from entertainers including Alyssa Milano, Katie Couric, Chelsea Handler and Janella Monae in the comments. It also drew plenty of flak from Trump supporters accusing her of using her family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health to push a political agenda. It had racked up more than 1.17 million views as of Monday afternoon, ahead of the Democratic National Convention, and was being shared on Twitter TWTR, -0.23% \u00c2 as well. Stone wrapped her video by calling on viewers to vote for Biden and Harris. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith women in power, we will fight for our families. We will fight for people to live. And we will fight for people to get tested,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause the only countries that are doing well with COVID are the ones that have women in leadership.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Stone is not the first to claim that the countries most affected by the coronavirus are run by men, and those with the best COVID-19 response are run by women. USA Today analyzed the Our World in Data database and found that the average number of deaths per million people by the end of July was, indeed, higher among male-led countries than women-led countries. And indeed, some female leaders have had success in flattening the curve in their countries, including New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, and Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen.

But USA Today also noted that \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s misleading and lacking context to say those successes and failures are solely due to gender,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and politics may have more to do with the success of a country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s response."}]}
