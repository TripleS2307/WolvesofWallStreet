Papa John\u00e2\u0080\u0099s PZZA, -1.18% \u00c2 reported second-quarter revenue that reached a record $460.6 million on Thursday, and North American same-store sales soared 28%. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPizza has always been really resilient in the face of economic challenges,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lynch told MarketWatch after the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s earnings call. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRecession can be a time of prosperity for pizza.\u00e2\u0080\u009d One reason is value. Lynch notes that for $15, a family of four can enjoy a pizza dinner. With the unemployment rate at 10.2%, more diners will be thinking about the cost of everyday items.

Noting the need to make food more affordable, Wendy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Co. WEN, +2.20% \u00c2 announced this week that it would be launching a Spicy Chicken Value Sandwich next week, and putting it on the \u00e2\u0080\u009c4 for $4\u00e2\u0080\u009d menu. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe also believe that value is going to play a key role for customers during this challenging time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Wendy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Chief Executive Todd Penegor on the earnings call, according to FactSet. Papa John\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Lynch says there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room on his company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s menu for items other than pizza. The company launched Papadia flatbreads with exceptional sales. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPapadias opened our eyes to the potential\u00e2\u0080\u009d of other items, Lynch said.

UBS rates Papa John\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stock neutral with a $100 price target, up from $78. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe strength of the pizza segment remains largely unmatched by Papa John\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and its direct peers (although a limited number of other concepts have also been beneficiaries of a convenience and contactless trend),\u00e2\u0080\u009d wrote MKM Partners\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Brett Levy. MKM also judges the health of the business by its growth plans. On the earnings call, Lynch said North American franchises closed the lowest number of locations in 10 years, thanks to strong sales and profitability. New store development has been paused due to the coronavirus, but Papa John\u00e2\u0080\u0099s looks forward to \u00e2\u0080\u009cattractive real estate opportunities in the months ahead,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lynch said on the call, according to a FactSet transcript. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. CMG, +0.01% \u00c2 , which beat its most recent earnings expectations, is also anticipating the choice real estate opportunities available in the near future. MKM rates Papa John\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stock neutral with an $84 price target, up from $82. Papa John\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shares have rallied 55% for the year to date.
