Furloughed from his job unloading inventory at Saks Fifth Avenue, it was Yi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first day volunteering at the food bank, loading groceries into car trunks. He saw the drivers waiting for groceries were in a mix of older cars and some newer models, including a Tesla TSLA, +1.89% \u00c2 Model X, which start at around $80,000. That moment permanently changed the way he thinks about money, he told MarketWatch. \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098I see the true power of an emergency fund and cash on hand.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Jacob Yi \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust seeing that people can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford necessities in a time like this, and the demand for groceries, is so hard. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I see the true power of an emergency fund and cash on hand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stopped his Starbucks SBUX, +0.53% \u00c2 habit and now orders food once a week, instead of four times. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doubled his savings account to $2,000. Jacob Yi says the economic downturn has permanently changed the way he thinks about money. Courtesy Jacob Yi In Orlando, Florida, Krista Thompson, an in-house lawyer for a satellite maker and single mother of three, has never spent more money on groceries and less on gas since the pandemic upended her work-life routine. The 35-year-old has taken a 20% pay cut and will be spending less on Christmas presents this year, and putting more towards her rainy day fund. Before the pandemic, Thompson had savings to cover six months of expenses. Now she wants to save enough cash to get her through a year. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s focused on saving \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but not as intensely as her grandfather, a man who grew up during the Great Depression and stashed his money under the floorboards years after the economic collapse. Krista Thompson had a six-month emergency savings fund before the pandemic. Now her goal is to save enough for a year. courtesy Krista Thompson \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to permanently change how I act financially. I think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be more cautious for an extended period of time, in my behavior at least,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. Those two personal-finance tales in the COVID-19 era touch on a broader question: will America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spending and savings habits permanently change because of the pandemic-related downturn? Economic slumps can inflict permanent \u00e2\u0080\u009cscars\u00e2\u0080\u009d on a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s views about spending and saving, researchers say. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss:Now I totally get why my father was so frugal \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098Consumers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 past lifetime experiences of economic conditions have a long-lasting effect on beliefs and consumption, which is not explained by income, wealth [and] liquidity.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 The study \u00e2\u0080\u0098Scarred Consumption,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 by Ulrike Malmendier and Leslie Sheng Shen Before the outbreak, economists at the University of California, Berkeley and the Federal Reserve wrote in a 2019 paper on \u00e2\u0080\u009cScarred Consumers\u00e2\u0080\u009d that people who live through periods of high unemployment show \u00e2\u0080\u009cpersistent pessimism about their future financial situation and spend significantly less.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Using information from decades-old ongoing surveys, the authors wrote that people who have lived through periods of high unemployment in their lifetimes \u00e2\u0080\u009chave more pessimistic beliefs about their financial situation in the future, and are more likely to believe that it is not a good time to purchase major household items in general.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The effect was seen across age, income levels, and other demographic factors. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been 100 days since the World Health Organization labeled the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. Since then, unemployment rates swung from a decades-low rates to double digits, reaching at post-World War II peak in April. Congress spent $2.2 trillion in a stimulus bill that included $290 billion for direct checks to Americans and $260 billion in supplemental unemployment benefits. The economy entered a recession in February, following a record-breaking expansion that lasted more than 10 years. After the \u00e2\u0080\u009csecond great catastrophe in a decade,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Richard Curtin, director of the University of Michigan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Survey Research Center, says he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009csure people will save more.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The center has been producing monthly indices on consumer sentiment for decades. \u201c The pandemic \u00e2\u0080\u0098only reinforces these views that you have to prepare and you have to save yourself.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Richard Curtin, director of the University of Michigan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Survey Research Center \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne of the lasting things that consumers learned from the Great Recession was that while large financial institutions could be saved by government policy, even corporations\u00e2\u0080\u00a6they were too small to save and they were left to face the problems on their own,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. The pandemic \u00e2\u0080\u009conly reinforces these views that you have to prepare and you have to save yourself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d (After the Great Recession, Americans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 savings rates had been edging upward.) The outbreak will alter many people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cmoney scripts\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a term for their emotional relationship with money \u00e2\u0080\u0094 said Angie O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Leary, who heads wealth planning at RBC Wealth Management-U.S. For younger consumers, the downturn could lead to a \u00e2\u0080\u009cscarcity of goods\u00e2\u0080\u009d mindset, she wrote. Evidence suggests that, for now at least, Americans are saving more money. Americans in April tucked away one-third of their after-tax disposable income in April, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a record high, up from a roughly 13% savings rate in March and an 8% rate in February. Americans had an aggregate balance of $6.4 billion in all deposit accounts under $250,000 during this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first quarter, according to the American Bankers Association. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s up from $6.1 billion in 2019\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fourth quarter, the trade association said. In that same time, accounts above $250,000 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which exclude retirement accounts \u00e2\u0080\u0094 rose from $7 billion to $7.7 billion. Other data challenges the idea we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all fast becoming more frugal. For example, retail sales soared 17.7% month-over-month in May, according to the Commerce Department. Meanwhile, general merchandise sales in the first week of June were up 3% compared to the same point last year, according to the NPD Group, a consumer research company. See also:The stunning retail-sales surge in May is great news, but don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect a repeat April marked the first time since 2010 that a majority of Americans (51%) told Gallup they were spending less than they were in recent months. This time, 53% of people who said they were spending less viewed it as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cnew, normal pattern for years ahead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ten years earlier, two-thirds of people spending less said this was the permanent pattern.What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening to money habits now? \u00e2\u0080\u009c100 days is certainly long enough to form a habit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Wendy Wood, author of \u00e2\u0080\u0098Good Habits, Bad Habits: The Science of Making Positive Changes That Stick.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Habits are behaviors that develop with repetition until they become an act that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performed without consciously thinking about it, explained Wood, a business and psychology professor at the University of Southern California. It can take two months for a simple task to become a habit, like having fruit at lunch, said Wood. It can take three or four months to establish an exercise routine, which involves more steps. \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098It will be surprising to many people, I think, that once we get back to some semblance of normalcy, that our habits will come back quite quickly because we are back in the context that is cueing old behavior.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Wendy Wood, professor of psychology and business at the University of Southern California \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will be surprising to many people, I think, that once we get back to some semblance of normalcy, that our habits will come back quite quickly because we are back in the context that is cueing old behavior,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. Some financial advisors say clients are re-thinking their investing behavior as a result of the pandemic. Ryan Bayonnet, principal of Hyland Financial Planning, a firm in Akron, Ohio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suburbs with $15 million in assets under management, has been telling his clients for years they need to boost their emergency savings. Some only had emergency cash for a month or two when Bayonnet advised between three and six. His clients are predominantly medical professionals, including doctors, pharmacists and dentists. They made it through the 2000 and 2009-2019 downturns without much impact on their own bottom line. This time, some had hours cut or salary reductions and took his advice to heart. \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098There was almost this illusion you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never be touched, and now that illusion is gone.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Ryan Bayonnet, principal of Hyland Financial Planning \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere was almost this illusion you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never be touched, and now that illusion is gone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Clients, on average, put an extra 25% to 50% in those emergency funds. He thinks they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll keep those accounts well-funded for good, knowing a recession \u00e2\u0080\u009ccould happen again and they could do something about it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yi was furloughed from Saks Fifth Avenue in late March. If he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s called back, it will be July at the earliest. The accounting major has developed a new routine in the meantime. He starts the day reading a chapter or two in a book, and he gets a workout in. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been trading for 18 months and invests in stocks and index funds \u00e2\u0080\u0094 another part of his plans to build up his own money. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be someone in need of cash ever in my life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want to be able to help others.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}]}
