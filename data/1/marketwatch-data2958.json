It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unlikely. The decisions in both the New York case and a separate case involving House Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 demands mean that the issue will again be in lower courts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 hands, with the November election on the horizon. At least one court watcher says that the New York case could be decided before then, but there doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t appear to be consensus on a speedy decision. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Read: Supreme Court rules Trump tax, financial records can be turned over to New York prosecutor, but rejects House Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 bid The ruling in the case involving Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance was a blow to Trump, who has long sought to keep his financial and tax records private. But since the records are being demanded as part of a confidential grand-jury investigation, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll stay under wraps unless exceptions are made. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn most jurisdictions, including New York, information collected for use in grand jury must by law be kept secret from the public and the press,\u00e2\u0080\u009d wrote Richard Lempert, an emeritus law professor at the University of Michigan. Lempert noted, however, that there are ways in which grand-jury information may be legally revealed, such as if a judge believes it is in the public interest. In sending the congressional case back to lower courts, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that they had not taken \u00e2\u0080\u009cadequate account of the significant separation of powers concerns implicated by congressional subpoenas for the President\u00e2\u0080\u0099s information.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyer, Jay Sekulow, said in a tweet that he would raise \u00e2\u0080\u009cadditional Constitutional and legal issues in the lower courts\u00e2\u0080\u009d: iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Vance in his own statement put no time frame on the New York investigation, saying only that it would resume. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a tremendous victory for our nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s system of justice and its founding principle that no one \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not even a president \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is above the law. Our investigation, which was delayed for almost a year by this lawsuit, will resume, guided as always by the grand jury\u00e2\u0080\u0099s solemn obligation to follow the law and the facts, wherever they may lead,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Democrats \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill continue to press our case in the lower courts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Also see:Chief Justice Roberts recently fell and hit his head, spent a night in a hospital"}]}
