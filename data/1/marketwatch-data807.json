Economists polled by MarketWatch has forecast a $66.7 billion trade gap. What happened: Imports of foreign goods and services rose 3.2% in August to $239 billion, the U.S. Census Bureau said Tuesday. Exports increased a smaller 2.2% to $171.9 billion. Imports have rebounded faster than exports, largely reflecting a stronger recovery in the U.S. economy compared to many of its trading partners. Imports are just 3% below prepandemic levels. Exports, on the other hand, are about 18% lower compared to the last month before the pandemic.

President Trump entered office almost four years ago vowing to slash chronically high U.S. trade deficits, but his effort has fallen short mostly due to longstanding patterns in imports and exports that are hard to shift. Americans buy so many imports, for instance, because a number of products are no longer made in the America.

Economists predict exports will begin to pick up more rapidly soon as the global economy recovers and supply chains are repair, driving U.S. trade deficits back down to precrisis levels. What they are saying? \u201cAs [U.S.] production continues to ramp up, there is plenty of scope for exports to catch up over the coming months,\u201d said senior U.S. economist Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics.
