To get this column each market day, click here. Broadly speaking, the major U.S. benchmarks are off to a constructive October start, reclaiming key technical levels. Against this backdrop, the S&P 500 has asserted a bullish-leaning intermediate-term bias, rising to three-week highs from a successful test of major support (3,328). Before detailing the U.S. markets\u2019 wider view, the S&P 500\u2019s SPX, +0.87% hourly chart highlights the past two weeks. As illustrated, the S&P has extended its rally attempt, reaching three-week highs. The prevailing upturn punctuates last week\u2019s range, underpinned by major support (3,328). From current levels, the breakout point (3,393) marks a near-term floor, a level matching the February peak. Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% has cleared its range top. Here again, the breakout punctuates a successful test of major support (27,447) a level that underpinned last week\u2019s price action on a closing basis. More immediately, the 28,000 mark remains an inflection point. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39% is challenging its range top. The prevailing upturn punctuates a jagged, but successful, test of the 50-day moving average, an area better illustrated on the daily chart below. Tactically, a notable floor matches the mid-September range top (11,245). Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has extended its rally attempt, notching a \u201chigher high\u201d versus the mid-September peak (11,245). The prevailing upturn punctuates a successful test of the 50-day moving average, currently 11,113, a recent bull-bear inflection point. Tactically, the sustained break atop the 50-day moving average \u2014 combined with a \u201chigher high\u201d to start October \u2014 signals a bullish-leaning intermediate-term bias. Looking elsewhere, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has extended a rally atop key resistance. The specific area matches the breakdown point (27,580) and the 50-day moving average, currently 27,684. The Dow\u2019s sustained rally atop resistance signals a bullish-leaning intermediate-term bias. Recall that the 50-day moving average defined the May, June and late-July lows. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has also extended its rally attempt, edging atop next resistance (3,393). In the process, the S&P has reclaimed its 50-day moving average, currently 3,369. Slightly more broadly, the upturn punctuates a successful test of major support (3,328), a bull-bear inflection point detailed repeatedly. The bigger picture Collectively, the major U.S. benchmarks are acting well technically to start October, and the fourth quarter. On a headline basis, the S&P 500 and Dow industrials have extended their rally attempts, rising from successful tests of major support \u2014 S&P 3,328 and Dow 27,447. (See the hourly charts.) Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF has extended a rally from the September low. In the process, the small-cap benchmark has reclaimed its 50-day moving average and the breakdown point (153.39). The breakout neutralizes the September downdraft. Tactically, additional overhead matches the August peak (159.82). Meanwhile, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 ETF has also reclaimed its 50-day moving average. The prevailing follow-through punctuates an October upturn initially fueled by increased volume. Looking elsewhere, the SPDR Trust S&P 500 SPY, +0.89% has also rallied atop major resistance. The specific area matches its former breakout point (338.35) and the 50-day moving average, currently 336.35. Recall that the prevailing upturn originates from major support matching the June peak. Placing a finer point on the S&P 500, its near-term backdrop is increasingly straightforward. To start, the S&P has rallied from major support (3,328), a bull-bear inflection point detailed repeatedly. This area effectively underpinned last week\u2019s range. Within the range, the 50-day moving average, currently 3,369, remains an inflection point. Slightly more broadly, the S&P has edged atop the February peak (3,393), a level defining its former breakout point. This area pivots to near-term support. On further strength, follow-through above the mid-September range top, circa 3,425, would mark a \u201chigher high\u201d incrementally strengthening the bull case. Conversely, the S&P 500\u2019s 50-day moving average \u2014 and major support (3,328) \u2014 remain useful bull-bear inflection points. A sustained posture higher signals a bullish-leaning intermediate-term bias.

These are radar screen names \u2014 sectors or stocks poised to move in the near term. For the original comments on the stocks below, see The Technical Indicator Library. Drilling down further, the 10-year Treasury note yield TNX, +1.30% has knifed to its best levels since June, rising amid a risk-on trade. (Treasury yields and bond prices are inversely correlated. Lower bond prices signal increased investor risk appetite.) The October upturn punctuates a tight seven-week range, underpinned by the 50-day moving average. Tactically, the upturn places the yield\u2019s range top (0.79) \u2014 a level closely matching the April peak \u2014 firmly under siege. Tuesday\u2019s early session high (0.792) has matched resistance. As detailed repeatedly, follow-through above the range top would open the path to a less-charted patch amid a developing double bottom. Such a move could be punctuated by swift upside follow-through. (See the mid-June spike.) Conversely, a downside inflection point matches the yield\u2019s former range top (0.75). The prevailing breakout attempt is intact barring a violation. (Also see the Aug. 28 review and Sept. 23 review.) Moving to U.S. sectors, the iShares Transportation Average IYT, +0.81% is acting well technically. The group initially spiked two months ago, staging a steep early-August breakout. The upturn marked a two standard deviation breakout, encompassing four straight closes atop the 20-day Bollinger bands. More immediately, the group has asserted an orderly six-week range \u2014 a bullish continuation pattern \u2014 positioning it to build on the steep August rally. Tactically, trendline support closely tracks the 50-day moving average, and is followed by the former breakout point (190.00). A posture higher signals a bullish intermediate-term bias. Moving to specific names, Motorola Solutions, Inc. MSI, +2.46% is a well positioned large-cap name. Technically, the shares are challenging seven-month highs, rising from a double bottom defined by the May and July lows. The prevailing tight one-week range signals muted selling pressure near resistance, improving the chances of eventual follow-through. Tactically, a breakout attempt is in play barring a violation of the October low (153.70). Also notice the pending golden cross \u2014 or bullish 50-day/200-day moving average crossover \u2014 signaling that the intermediate-term uptrend has overtaken the longer-term trend. Gap, Inc. GPS, -0.10% is a large-cap retailer coming to life. As illustrated, the shares have knifed to 52-week highs, clearing resistance matching the September peak. The upturn originates from trendline support closely tracking the 50-day moving average. Though near-term extended, and due to consolidate, a pullback toward the breakout point (18.40) would offer an attractive entry. More broadly, the shares are well positioned on the three-year chart, edging atop major resistance matching the late-2019 range top. Finally, Sunnova Energy International, Inc. NOVA, +4.78% \u2014 public since July 2019 \u2014 is a mid-cap developer of residential-solar and energy-storage solutions. Late last month, the shares knifed to record highs, clearing the August peak amid a volume spike. The subsequent pullback has been underpinned by the breakout point (28.60), placing the shares 14.9% under the October peak. Tactically, deeper support matches the August and September gaps, circa 27.20. A sustained posture higher signals a bullish bias.
