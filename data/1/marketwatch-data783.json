U.S. officials also believe that China does not want Trump to win a second term and that Beijing has accelerated its criticism of the president and its efforts to shape American opinion and public policy. Opinion:No, China is rooting for Trump to win, and here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why The statement from William Evanina comes amid criticism from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other congressional Democrats that the intelligence community has been withholding from the public specific intelligence information about the threat of foreign interference in the upcoming election.

He said that would track Moscow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s criticism of Biden when he was vice president for his role in Ukraine policies and his support of opposition to President Vladimir Putin inside Russia. The latest intelligence assessment reflects concerns to varying degrees about China, Russia and Iran, warning that hostile foreign actors may seek to compromise election infrastructure and interfere with the voting process. \u201c House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and fellow congressional Democrats have expressed frustration that the intelligence community has been withholding from the public specific intelligence information about the threat of foreign interference in the upcoming election. \u201d Those concerns are especially acute following a wide-ranging effort by Russia to interfere in the 2016 election on Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behalf through both the hacking of Democratic emails and a covert social-media campaign aimed at sowing discord among U.S. voters.

China has been expanding its influence efforts ahead of the November election in an effort to shape U.S. policy and pressure political figures it sees as against Beijing, he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlthough China will continue to weigh the risks and benefits of aggressive action, its public rhetoric over the past few months has grown increasingly critical of the current administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s COVID-19 response, closure of China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Houston consulate and actions on other issues,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote. On Iran, the assessment said Tehran seeks to undermine U.S. democratic institutions as well as Trump and divide America before the election. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIran\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts along these lines probably will focus on online influence, such as spreading disinformation on social media and recirculating anti-U.S. content,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Evanina wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTehran\u00e2\u0080\u0099s motivation to conduct such activities is, in part, driven by a perception that President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s re-election would result in a continuation of U.S. pressure on Iran in an effort to foment regime change.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Read on:Biden eyes major foreign-policy shifts if he wins"}]}
