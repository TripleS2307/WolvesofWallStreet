Kamala Harris accepted the Democratic Party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vice-presidential nomination in a deeply personal speech on Wednesday, stressing her upbringing by immigrant parents and outlining a vision to join Joe Biden in defeating President Donald Trump in November\u00e2\u0080\u0099s election. Speaking live from the Chase Center in Wilmington, Del., Harris wove between her own biography, her partnership with Biden and searing criticism of Trump, who she said was guilty of a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfailure of leadership.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are a nation that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grieving. Grieving the loss of life, the loss of jobs, the loss of opportunities, the loss of normalcy. And yes, the loss of certainty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, invoking the coronavirus pandemic. Harris, a California senator who ran against Biden in the Democratic primaries, is the first Black woman and first person of Indian descent on a major party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ticket. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn this election, we have a chance to change the course of history,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Harris said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all in this fight. You, me and Joe \u00e2\u0080\u0094 together.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Read: The full text of Kamala Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0099s speech to the Democratic convention Biden will speak from the same venue on Thursday night during the final evening of the convention. Biden announced Harris as his running mate on Aug. 11, choosing her over other contenders including Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former national-security adviser Susan Rice. Some on Wall Street DJIA, +0.56% \u00c2 were relieved Harris was chosen over more liberal candidates like Warren, who has called for tighter rules on banks. Now read:Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what Kamala Harris means and doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean for financial markets. Still, some see Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pick of Harris as \u00e2\u0080\u009cmodestly negative\u00e2\u0080\u009d for financials XLF, +0.11%, since she opposed a bank-deregulation law, but positive for other industries including cannabis MJ, +0.26%. Harris is a sponsor of legislation to decriminalize marijuana at the federal level. During the primaries, Harris said there was \u00e2\u0080\u009cno question\u00e2\u0080\u009d she was in favor of banning fracking XLE, -1.59%, and also supported the Green New Deal. She backed Sen. Bernie Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Medicare for All bill, but during her campaign said she wanted a role for private health plans. Biden hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t endorsed the Green New Deal or Medicare for All. Also see:Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where Joe Biden has moved to the left \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and where he hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. In a Biden-Harris White House, the senator could work on issues including police reform, a central political topic in the wake of the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, in police custody in May. Harris invoked Floyd\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name in her speech and noted that the coronavirus has disproportionately killed people of color. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is not a coincidence. It is the effect of structural racism,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. Trump has tried to paint the Biden-Harris ticket as far to the left of center, with his campaign dubbing this week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s events the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cSocialist Convention.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump has accused Harris as being \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery big into raising taxes\u00e2\u0080\u009d and said she was \u00e2\u0080\u009cextraordinarily nasty\u00e2\u0080\u009d to Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh while questioning him during his 2018 confirmation hearings. At 55, Harris may one day be poised to succeed Biden, who is 77, if he wins the White House in the fall. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s age prompted questions about whether he would serve two terms as president and put extra focus on his choice of a running mate. Biden in late April said he viewed himself \u00e2\u0080\u009cas a transition candidate\u00e2\u0080\u009d who would have young leaders in his administration.
