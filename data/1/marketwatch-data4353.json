The latest jobs data show that the recovery is faltering, they say, but they do expect the economy to gradually regain its footing, with gross domestic product rising 5% in 2021. The unemployment rate will probably still be around 10% at the end of this year, they say, with a strong jobs recovery next year once the coronavirus is beaten back. Led by U.S. chief economist Seth Carpenter, the winning team at UBS includes Sam Coffin, Alan Detmeister, Andrew Dubinsky and Laura Desplans. It\u2019s the 11th time that UBS has won our monthly contest. Seth Carpenter, chief U.S. economist at UBS. UBS \u201cThe risks are deep,\u201d Coffin said in a phone interview. Job growth is faltering, incomes are falling, and both households and businesses remain leery of making too many long-term plans. The key driver of the outlook for the economy is what assumptions you make about the path of the virus, said Detmeister. It\u2019s less about the number of cases than the level of restrictions in place, he said. UBS is assuming no further large spikes in infections, Coffin said. So that\u2019s a risk to their forecast. They\u2019re more focused on the economic risks, such as \u201clabor-market scarring,\u201d sluggish capital spending and businesses reluctant to act. The next six to 12 months will likely exhibit the effects of a \u201cprolonged dislocation in the labor market,\u201d Coffin said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to drive this is how fast people get their jobs back.\u201d The latest data show that most of the job gains since the depths of April have come in the heavily beaten-down food services, accommodation and retail sectors. But there\u2019s been almost none in sectors that were able to shift workers to home offices. More troubling trends: Growth in manufacturing jobs stalled in July outside the automotive sector. The labor-force participation rate dipped in July after gains in May and June. \u201cAnd within the employed, a large share remained either part time for economic reasons or employed but not at work,\u201d they wrote in a note to clients. The retail sector is under strain, and bankruptcies are looming in many sectors of the economy. The biggest headwind in the next few months will be a large drop in income, due to the expiration of massive federal relief. Even if Congress does agree to another round of extended employment benefits or direct payments, it won\u2019t replace all the income support that was \u201cthe lifeblood to prevent the economy from tanking\u201d from March through July. They figure household incomes will drop 10% at an annual rate. Regardless of what Washington does, consumption will slow in September and October, Coffin said. In the July contest, the UBS team had the most accurate forecasts among 45 teams on three of the 11 indicators we track: consumer confidence, the consumer price index and the trade deficit. Their forecasts on four other indicators \u2014 the ISM manufacturing index, durable-goods orders, GDP and housing starts \u2014 were among the 10 most accurate.
