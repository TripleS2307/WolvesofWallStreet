Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio don\u2019t agree on much these days, but they are singing one verse of harmony: It sure would be nice if some of New York\u2019s wealthiest COVID-19 refugees would come back home. Leave their Hamptons hideaways. Exit their Hudson Valley quarantines. Depart their Connecticut weekend manses, return to New York City, and start paying their full share of taxes again. But that, right there, is where the sweet song ends. When it comes to making the Great Return actually happen or deciding what it even means, New York\u2019s two top leaders are at each other\u2019s throats again. Cuomo is sounding like a frustrated ma\u00eetre d\u2019, not quite able to usher the big tippers back to what had been their usual tables. \u201cI literally talk to people all day long who are now in their Hamptons house and also lived here,\u201d the governor bemoaned to reporters in the city. \u201cAnd I say, \u2018You gotta come back. When are you coming back? We\u2019ll go to dinner. I\u2019ll buy you a drink. Come over. I\u2019ll cook.\u201d He must have a lot of rich friends! See: \u2018I can\u2019t believe this is America.\u2019 Confronted with unprecedented need, New York food pantries try to fill in the gaps But even the promise of chicken cacciatore alla Andrew hasn\u2019t been enough to drag these well ensconced refugees back to New York City. \u201cThey\u2019re not coming back right now,\u201d Cuomo insisted. \u201cAnd you know what else they\u2019re thinking? \u2018If I stay there,\u2019 they pay a lower income tax because they don\u2019t pay the New York City surcharge.\u201d So the last thing the city and the state should be thinking about right now is raising rich folks\u2019 taxes. Or so Cuomo argues. That could convince some of the Richie Riches to stay away for good. But to the city\u2019s progressive mayor, those are fighting words. \u201cFair-weather friends,\u201d de Blasio grumbled about selfish city dwellers who are hiding out of town until a vaccine is found and the recent crime wave blows over. \u201cThis city is for New Yorkers who live here, who work here and fight to stay here,\u201d the mayor sniffed. \u201cWe must build our policy around all New Yorkers\u2026We don\u2019t make decisions based on the wealthy few. I was troubled to hear that concept.\u201d If people with money want a voice in the city\u2019s future, de Blasio suggested, they should get their butts back to the boroughs right now.

People rich enough to have two or three homes\u2014should they really be ducking the city income-tax surcharge by temporarily shifting their residences? If they were spending money like they used to, at least the city would be getting its share of the sales taxes. \u201cThe rich are getting richer,\u201d de Blasio said, summing up his argument. \u201cWealthy New Yorkers can afford to pay a little bit more so all of us can get through this crisis.\u201d This is much more than a stylistic debate, Cuomo\u2019s tough love versus de Blasio\u2019s no love at all. It\u2019s more than philosophical, a mainstream progressive versus an uber one. What\u2019s at stake here really is the economic engine of New York. It\u2019s a fact of urban living: Cities are expensive to operate. You have to pay the bills somehow. The money only comes from people who have it. But unless that money gets here soon, the state will face budget cuts in the 20% range, enough to devastate school aid, subway subsidies and all kinds of other vital services. The city cuts could be even sharper. Cuomo estimated that the health crisis \u2014 the extra cost and lower revenue \u2014 has blown a $30-billion hole in the next two state budgets. And every indication is the Great Return is still a good ways off. There is no other way to read the real estate sales data released late Thursday by the Manhattan broker Douglas Elliman and appraiser Miller Samuel. Signed contracts for co-ops and condos were down 57%, July to July, and the upper end of the market got especially slammed. In the $4 million to $10 million category, sales agreements were off 75%. Meanwhile, things were really humming in the \u2019burbs, the beaches and the country.

When do prices begin to tumble? The one thing the real estate people didn\u2019t mention were any three-bedroom units on Park Avenue being offered at half price. No mention of that at all.
