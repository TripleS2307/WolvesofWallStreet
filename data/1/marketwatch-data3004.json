SBUX, +0.53% said Thursday that starting July 15, the coffee seller will require customers to wear a face covering at company-owned U.S. stores. \u201cAt select locations where a local government mandate is not in place, customers that may not be wearing a facial covering will have various options to order their Starbucks, including ordering at the drive-thru, curbside pickup through the Starbucks app or placing an order for delivery through Starbucks Delivers,\u201d the company said on its website. Retailers and other businesses across the country have faced the angry customers for mandating face coverings. Starbucks has been at the center of controversy in the past, for instance, prompting calls for boycotts, including recently for asking workers not to wear Black Lives Matter gear. Starbucks stock has tumbled 16.7% for the year to date while the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% is down 2.7% for the period."}]}
