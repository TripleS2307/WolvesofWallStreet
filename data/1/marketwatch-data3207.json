A drop in the U.S. unemployment rate and a better-than-expected job growth in June only briefly managed to pull prices lower during Thursday\u2019s session. \u201cInvestors do not largely believe that the unemployment rate is going to fall as rapidly as we have seen in the past two months,\u201d Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at AvaTrade told MarketWatch. The U.S. added 4.8 million jobs in June and the unemployment rate fell for the second straight month to 11.1%. The increase in new jobs easily exceeded the 3.7 million forecast of economists polled by MarketWatch. However, the economy\u2019s recuperation from the coronavirus might already be suffering a setback from a renewed surge in COVID-19 cases. \u201cThe employment numbers are spectacular but an 11% unemployment rate is still elevated,\u201d said Jeff Wright, executive vice president of GoldMining Inc. \u201cCOVID cases are back on the rise and numerous states have slowed down reopen plans.\u201d New U.S. coronavirus cases hit a single-day record on Wednesday of more than 52,000 while the global total reached 2.64 million and death toll of 127,681. Against that backdrop, August gold US:GCQ20 picked up $10.10, or 0.6%, to settle at $1,790 an ounce, following a 1.1% decline on Wednesday. For the holiday-shorted week, prices based on the most-active contract finished around 0.5% higher than last Friday\u2019s settlement, according to FactSet data.
