Vice President Pence acknowledged that the U.S. has \u201cgone through a very challenging time this year\u201d while also saying that Trump has put Americans\u2019 health first. Harris attacked such assertions, with the U.S. COVID-19 death toll topping 211,000. The senator from California charged that Americans have witnessed what she called \u201cthe greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country.\u201d Coronavirus update:U.S. death toll tops 211,000 as doctors caution that Trump is entering a key phase in his diagnosis Harris said she\u2019d take a coronavirus vaccine if the government\u2019s top doctors say it\u2019s safe. \u201cIf Donald Trump tells us that we should take it, I\u2019m not taking it,\u201d she said. Pence asked her to \u201cstop playing politics with people\u2019s lives.\u201d Despite occasional barbs, the Pence-Harris face-off was civil compared with the first debate between Trump and Biden, at which the presidential contenders frequently talked over each other and the moderator. Pence and Harris sat 12 feet apart, separated by plexiglass, while on stage at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, in a visual reminder of how the virus has spread throughout the country, and even to the White House. See MarketWatch live blog of Pence-Harris debate. The two also sparred over the Republican tax overhaul of 2017, which sharply increased the federal deficit while lowering corporate taxes and some personal taxes and doing away with some popular deductions, with Pence charging that a Biden-Harris administration would raise Americans\u2019 taxes. Harris countered by saying Biden wouldn\u2019t raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 a year.
