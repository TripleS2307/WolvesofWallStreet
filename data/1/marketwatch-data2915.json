SPI Energy SPI, -8.51%, which is described as offering photovoltaic solutions for business, residential, government and utility customers and investors, saw its shares trade at $33.53 a share after closing on Tuesday at $1.05, according to FactSet data. The surge in the company's shares, has pushed its market value from roughly $15 million to around $460 million, the data show. The company on Wednesday said it launched its wholly owned subsidiary, EdisonFuture, which is intended to design and develop electric-vehicles and EV charging solutions. That would pit the company against the likes of Tesla Inc. TSLA, +1.89%, which is one of the most popular EV makers on the planet and a manufacturer of its own EV batteries. Xiaofeng Peng, CEO of SPI Energy, in a statement said: \"As Tesla has demonstrated, an end-to-end business model in the renewable energy space can generate significant value.
