Bernie Sanders ripped President Donald Trump and delivered a forceful speech in favor of Joe Biden during the Democratic National Convention on Monday, urging those who voted for other candidates in the party's primary to get behind the former vice president's White House bid. \"We need Joe Biden as our next president,\" Sanders, a Vermont independent, said via video to the convention, an almost entirely virtual event due to the coronavirus pandemic. The prime speaking spot for Sanders - who ran against Biden in the Democratic presidential primary - was a significant nod to the progressive wing of the party. And it's not the only one: On Tuesday, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, another progressive standard-bearer, is scheduled to speak.

After Sanders' exit from the primaries, backers of both the Vermont senator and Biden bridged some of their policy divides in recommendations of joint task forces. But gaps remained on key issues, with progressive ideas like the \"Green New Deal\" and \"Medicare for All\" not making it into the recommendations. Sanders in his speech acknowledged that he and Biden disagree on issues including health care. But he lauded Biden's support of raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, making it easier for workers to join unions, and fighting the threat of climate change. Trump is attacking Biden as a \"Trojan Horse for socialism,\" who is beholden to progressives like Sanders. Trump has charged that markets SPX, +0.87%  and the economy would sink under Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris - even as some analysts say a Democratic sweep would be best for Wall Street. Opinion:The stock market would love a Democratic sweep in November."}]}
