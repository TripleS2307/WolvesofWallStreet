It has been updated to reflect the positive COVID-19 diagnosis for President Bolsonaro on July 7 and includes the latest coronavirus confirmed case and death data for Brazil.) Brazilian doctors are fuming, joining growing ranks of furious compatriots, about President Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s widely criticized mishandling of the country\u2019s coronavirus crisis and suppression of case data as businesses have reopened despite rising deaths. \u201cYes, it\u2019s Bolsonaro\u2019s fault,\u201d said Thais Couto, a 32-year-old lung surgeon in Sao Paulo, who like many doctors around the nation is exhausted and overwhelmed as Brazil sees roughly 1,200 deaths per day or one a minute. \u201cFrom the beginning, he hasn\u2019t taken this seriously, laughing about the disease and saying it\u2019s just a flu and not a big deal.\u201d Bolsonaro confirmed on Tuesday that he has tested positive for COVID-19. He told reporters in the capital Brasilia that he is already taking hydroxychloroquine \u2014 an anti-malarial unproven by several studies to effectively treat COVID-19, the Associated Press said. In June, a Brazilian supreme court judge ordered Bolsonaro\u2019s administration to resume publishing complete COVID-19 statistics after leadership purged the health ministry website of historical data relating to the pandemic and announced it would stop publishing the cumulative death toll or number of infections. The death toll in Latin America\u2019s largest economy stands at 65,487 through July 7, according to the Johns Hopkins University & Medicine dashboard. Total infections have reached just more than 1.6 million reported cases. Brazil is on track to surpass the U.S. as the country with the world\u2019s deadliest outbreak, probably by late July, according to the University of Washington\u2019s Institution for Health Metrics and Evaluation. By comparison, the U.S. has reported 130,430 deaths and 2.9 million infections. Globally, the pandemic has killed 539,058.

Dr. Thais Couto, in green, shown with nursing colleagues, believes the statistics that put Brazil on track to surpass the U.S. in COVID-19 deaths. Thais Couto \u201cIf you think Trump is stupid, you don\u2019t know Bolsonaro,\u201d said Couto, who had to cancel her first U.S. trip to Orlando after the U.S. president banned Brazilians from entering the country. Couto, who works in four facilities including state-run Hospital de Brasil\u00e2ndia and private facility Alvorada, said she believes that the right-wing populist Bolsonaro\u2019s virus dismissal has split Brazilians into two camps: those that support his view and value businesses reopening for economic growth and those appalled by his cavalier attitude (recent videos showed him eating a hot dog in public in Brasilia, despite angry protesters calling him an \u201cassassin\u201d and \u201cbum\u201d) and worried that major cities are not ready to return to normal, potentially triggering a second wave of illnesses that could spin out of control. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } June polls, before his diagnosis, suggested Bolsonaro still enjoys the backing of a third of Brazilians. \u201cThe problem in Brazil is that COVID-19 has become a highly politicized public emergency,\u201d said Adele Benzaken, a doctor and public health expert in Manaus, the country\u2019s virus epicenter and home to disturbing mass-grave images shocking the world. \u201cEveryone is blaming the population because they don\u2019t care for themselves or use masks or do this or that. But the message from the federal government, the president, ministers and municipalities is always very contradictory [with Bolsonaro clashing with governors over the extent of the lockdowns to protect the economy, for instance]. So people ask, who do I follow, the government or the president or the mayor?\u201d Don\u2019t miss:100 days of the COVID-19 pandemic: 5 critical mistakes that created the biggest public health crisis in a generation \u201c \u2018In the Amazon and in Manaus we have cultural barriers because our indigenous cultures have a lot of difficulties to understand a new disease and the preventions for it.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Dr. Adele Benzaken Those clashing messages made things particularly hard in the Amazonian city of Manaus, where cases involving vulnerable indigenous communities quadrupled from May 3 to May 30 reaching 33,200 just before they began to decline, as many people failed to follow social distancing measures. \u201cIn the Amazon and in Manaus we have cultural barriers because our indigenous cultures have a lot of difficulties to understand a new disease and the preventions for it,\u201d said Benzaken. Bolsonaro and Manaus Mayor Arthur Virgilio Neto\u2019s bitter dispute over how the city of 2 million should contain the pandemic, coupled with similar skirmishes around the country, has not helped provide a clear message to help people survive COVID-19, she added. Benzaken, who leads efforts to fight HIV in Brazil, said Brasilia\u2019s response was inadequate and came too late to stave off a major crisis. \u201cWe did not have a lockdown and the population is suffering because of that, because of a president that does not believe the disease is serious and is always against the lockdowns,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery weekend, he goes out and eats hot dogs on the street and leads demonstrations to tell people they don\u2019t have to stay home.\u201d Compared to Europe or the U.S., Brazil did not impose national curfews or strict quarantines. Instead, Brasilia let states and local governments decide how to handle the pandemic. This resulted in partial quarantines that were too relaxed, critics claim, urging citizens to follow social distancing recommendations that were not fully enforced. Non-essential businesses such as retailers and restaurants were forced to shutter for three months, however. In mid-June, Sao Paulo and Rio began to reopen, with stores and malls hoping to recover from three months of losses, just as Brazil celebrated Valentine\u2019s Day or Dia dos Namorados on June 12. Couto said the move was a bad idea and could boost infections amid Sao Paulo\u2019s overwhelmed hospitals. \u201cThings are going to get worse,\u201d she said, adding that the city\u2019s ICUs will have a hard time coping with a spike in cases amid a critical shortage of doctors who often treat many more patients than they can handle. Couto agreed with a University of Washington Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)\u2019s survey that said Brazil could surpass U.S. deaths by July 29 when it\u2019s on track to record 137,500 against the U.S.\u2019s 137,000, based on current infection trends. \u201c \u2018People are not taking this seriously. They think that it\u2019s going to be solved by the Universe. Of course, we have people who are taking care of themselves but others don\u2019t believe in this thing. They think it\u2019s political, that the virus doesn\u2019t exist.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Dr. Thais Couto Given Brazilians\u2019 relaxed attitude to life \u2014 and the fact that many refuse to wear masks (despite now being now mandatory in most cities) \u2014 it would not surprise her if that forecast came true. \u201cPeople are crazy here in Brazil,\u201d Couto said, adding that many Paulistas (as Sao Paulo natives are called) have ignored social distancing recommendations, going to parties or barber shops. \u201cPeople are not taking this seriously. They think that it\u2019s going to be solved by the Universe. Of course, we have people who are taking care of themselves but others don\u2019t believe in this thing. They think it\u2019s political, that the virus doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d Mariana Gimaraes, who works as a fashion PR executive in Sao Paulo, said the reopening is necessary to avert an economic meltdown after retailers and restaurants were shuttered for nearly three months. \u201cPeople need to make money so they have to reopen businesses,\u201d she said. \u201cAlso, in the city of Sao Paulo, the cases are more stable, unlike Rio where Mayor Marcelo Crivella has said stores will remain closed until cases come down.\u201d Gimaraes doesn\u2019t think Brazil\u2019s pandemic will become as severe as America\u2019s. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be like the U.S. In Sao Paulo state, the state is pursuing very strong policies to ensure everything goes well,\u201d she noted, adding that cities are becoming very strict to ensure businesses follow WHO regulations. \u201c \u2018People need to make money so they have to reopen businesses. Also, in the city of Sao Paulo, the cases are more stable.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Mariana Gimaraes, fashion PR executive Meanwhile in the Amazon Jungle, cases are soaring along the Amazon River, with indigenous advocacy groups pleading for the government to send more personal protective equipment (PPE) for doctors to treat patients in isolated communities where the sickest must be flown to Manaus for treatment. \u201cWe are hoping the help will be more robust,\u201d Benzaken said. \u201cYou have 63 municipalities in the Amazon and 60 don\u2019t have PPEs or ICUs.\u201d"}]}
