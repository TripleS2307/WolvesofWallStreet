Germany\u2019s federal minister for economic affairs and energy, Peter Altmaier, and Dietmar Hopp, co-founder of software group SAP SE and of the investment company dievini Hopp BioTech holding GmbH & Co. KG, jointly announced the government would invest \u20ac300 million ($337 million) in CureVac, according to the company website. The investment will be made by the state-owned development bank Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW). Funds will partly be used to further develop the company\u2019s drug pipeline, including its COVID-vaccine. Under the agreement, KfW will end up with a 23% stake in CureVac. In mid-March, a political storm broke out over a report in German newspaper Welt am Sonntag, which claimed the administration of President Donald Trump was trying to secure CureVac\u2019s vaccine exclusively for the U.S. via a large financial donation. German officials said at the time the government was entering talks with CureVac to fed off any U.S. move, the Wall Street Journal reported. The company, however, denied at the time the U.S. had made any overture, while the U.S.\u2019s then\u2013ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, also said the German newspaper report had been incorrect, Reuters reported. Relocating CureVac to the U.S. would have put the company outside Germany\u2019s jurisdiction. In the statement, Altmaier said the government was investing in CureVac to help accelerate development programs and gain more independence when it comes to vaccines, something many countries have been aiming for as the outbreak of a new coronavirus developed into a global pandemic. \u201cThis is also of high importance for industrial policy as we in Germany and Europe need these essential research results and technologies. At the same time, today\u2019s move is a first and important implementation of the comprehensive Corona Economic Stimulus and Future Technologies Package,\u201d enacted by the government on June 3, said Altmaier. A handful of vaccine candidates developed by companies including Sinovac Biotech Ltd., Moderna Inc. MRNA, +0.09% and BioNTech BNTX, +1.23% and Pfizer Inc. have moved into clinical trials, and many of the world\u2019s leading vaccine makers, including AstraZeneca AZN, +1.16%, AZN, +0.63%, Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +1.39% and Sanofi SNY, +0.89% SAN, +1.20%, are planning to develop and test COVID-19 vaccines in clinical studies. In the U.S., the government is funding studies for some experimental vaccines. In the U.K., human trials of one potential COVID-19 vaccine, which, it\u2019s hoped, could protect the population from the disease for \u00a33 per person, are reportedly due to begin this week."}]}
