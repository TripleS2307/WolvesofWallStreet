The concerns come amid recent reports that the U.K. is considering a second nationwide lockdown, and as data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University showed that new coronavirus cases have increased in about two-thirds of the states in the U.S. Worries about the new surge in cases helped weigh on the stock market, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% sank 664 points, or 2.4%, in afternoon trading, and the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% slid 1.9%.

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump last week contradicted comments made by his administration\u2019s health experts regarding the timing of when a vaccine might be available, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had to reverse course on new testing guidelines after the New York Times reported that the new guidelines were actually written by the Trump administration and not CDC scientists. An ABC/News/Ipsos poll released Sunday showed that 69% of Americans surveyed don\u2019t have confidence in the president\u2019s claims regarding a virus, with 53% saying they have no confidence at all, and only 9% saying they have a great deal of confidence in Trump\u2019s claims. Admiral Brett Giroir, the White House coronavirus testing czar, went on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday to try to assure the public that the U.S. response to the coronavirus won\u2019t be politicized, that when a vaccine is made available that it will be safe and to pound home the point the Americans should wear masks. \u201cBiology is independent of politics,\u201d Giroir told host Jake Tapper. \u201c[A]ll of the docs, all the public health experts, all of us are really unanimous that it\u2019s important to wear a mask when you cannot physically distance.\u201d When pressed by Tapper about how effective that message might be, when the indoor political rallies held by President Trump don\u2019t require people to wear masks, despite state mandates, Giroir said, \u201cI just want to repeat what I said, we always encourage the wearing of a mask.\u201d He said that wearing a mask was \u201ccritical\u201d to preventing the spread of the coronavirus. \u201cThis needs to be echoed from the local, from the state, from the public, and certainly all of us on the task force want to make sure people understand that.\u201d Regarding the contradictions in the timing of when a vaccine will be available, Giroir didn\u2019t quite use the phase \u201calternative facts,\u201d but he did say: \u201cEverybody is right, but they\u2019re talking about different aspects.\u201d He said the availability of a vaccine depends only on the evidence and the science. And until the science says there is a vaccine that is safe and efficacious, the process of making it available can\u2019t get started. \u201cSo right now, we do not have a safe and effective vaccine,\u201d Giroir said. \u201cI just want to assure the American people that when a vaccine is authorized by the [Food and Drug Administration], it will be based on science and data.\u201d In other news: \u2022 The \u201cHealthy Sail Panel\u201d formed by Royal Caribbean Group and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. submitted its recommendations to the CDC, in response to a request for public comment that will be used to inform health guidance and preventive measures related to travel on cruise ships. The panel\u2019s report, which is more than 65 pages, includes 74 detailed \u201cbest practices\u201d to protect the health and safety of guests, crew and the communities where cruise ships sail. Recommendations include testing, the use of face coverings and enhanced sanitation procedures, on board the cruise ships and in the terminals \u201cThe Healthy Sail Panel spent the last four months studying how to better protect the health and safety of guests and crew aboard cruise ships,\u201d said Dr. Scott Gottlieb, co-chair of the panel and former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. \u201cTaken as a comprehensive approach, we believe the panel\u2019s robust public health recommendations will help inform strategies for a safe resumption of sailing.\u201d Meanwhile, on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday, Gottlieb said he thinks there will be \u201cone more cycle\u201d with the virus heading into the fall and winter. \u2022 Iowa\u2019s largest school system faces crippling bills because of a dispute with Republican Governor Kim Reynolds, who issued an order requiring the state\u2019s school districts to hold at least half their classes in-person rather than online, the Associated Press reported. That\u2019s because the Des Moines school board voted again last week to violate the order. If the district is out of compliance, the state could require the district to keep students in classes until the end of June, nearly a month later than usual; a district official said each additional day would cost about $1.5 million, which would drain reserves within days. New York City schools reopen Monday for pre-K students and children with advanced disabilities. The rest of the students will start online, and have the option to return to classrooms over the next few weeks. Iowa is a state in which new cases are rising, with 606 new cases in a day at last count, JHU data show. In addition, Iowa has among the highest ratios of tests that have positive results at 14.9% this week, compared with the World Health Organization\u2019s guidelines that positivity rates should stay below 5%. New York\u2019s daily cases rose in the past week, with 862 in the past day, but the percent of positive tests was among the lowest at 0.9%. \u2022 There is some renewed hope that rheumatoid arthritis drugs, like Eli Lilly & Co.\u2019s LLY, +2.20% and Incyte Corp.\u2019s INCY, +3.19% Olumiant and Roche Holding AG\u2019s ROG, +1.80% Actemra, can be possible COVID-19 treatments, after a series of clinical setbacks this summer had seemed to close the door on the possibility, as MarketWatch\u2019s Jaimy Lee reports.Latest tallies There are now 31.17 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 globally, the Johns Hopkins data show, and 962,046 people have died.
