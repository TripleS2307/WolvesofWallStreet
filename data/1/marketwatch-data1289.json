Technically the Ford Escape Plug-in Hybrid earns 100 MPGe, with the last letter signaling \"equivalent\" by the EPA. That's the rating the government agency gives vehicles such as this when they use an electrified powertrain. Related: How to choose trim levels and options when buying a new car The Ford Escape is all new for 2020, and it already offers a hybrid model along with standard gasoline-only powertrains. The regular 2020 Ford Escape Hybrid earns an impressive 41 mpg combined. But thanks to its larger battery pack, the Ford Escape Plug-in Hybrid trounces that number for a class-leading 100 MPGe.Power and efficiency Like the standard Escape Hybrid, this plug-in model pairs a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine with an electric motor good for a total of 200 horsepower. But the larger battery pack means the plug-in model can travel a sizable distance on electricity alone - up to 37 miles. Between the electrification and gasoline engine, the Ford Escape PHEV's total range is EPA-rated at 530 miles. Ford says recharge times are 10-11 hours on a standard 110-volt outlet or under 3.5 hours on a Level 2, 240-volt line.Choice of three trims The 2020 Ford Escape Plug-in Hybrid is on sale now and available in three trims: SE (starting at $33,040, plus destination fee), SEL ($35,620), and Titanium ($36,435). These prices are several thousand dollars higher than the standard hybrid, but the PHEV also has potential cost savings beyond its enhanced efficiency.

All models include standard safety features such as forward-collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping assist and blind-spot monitoring. Apple AAPL, +1.74%  CarPlay and Android Auto integration is also included. Top-tier Titanium models boast amenities like adaptive cruise control, Bang & Olufsen premium audio, leather interior and 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster.New territory for SUVs While hybrid SUVs have been around a while - in fact, the original first-gen Escape Hybrid was the world's first hybrid sport-utility vehicle when it made its debut 15 years ago - plug-in hybrid SUVs relatively new. The Ford Escape PHEV recently went on sale, and what looks to be a formidable competitor is just around the corner.
