Barry, professor at the Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, and author of \u201cThe Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History,\u201d wrote in a New York Times op-ed Wednesday that the U.S. needs to follow the example of the dozens of countries that have managed to tame the spread and reopen their economies safely. \u201cAt this writing, Italy, once the poster child of coronavirus devastation and with a population twice that of Texas, has recently averaged about 200 new cases a day when Texas has had over 9,000,\u201d Barry wrote. \u201cGermany, with a population four times that of Florida, has had fewer than 400 new cases a day. On Sunday, Florida reported over 15,300, the highest single-day total of any state.\u201d The crucial difference is that those countries all took the virus seriously from the get-go, acted swiftly and decisively and continue to do so. Australia just issued $18,000 of fines because too many people attended a birthday party in a home, he wrote. U.S. health experts were clear that to replicate Europe\u2019s success, the U.S. would need to shut down for as long as needed to achieve a steep downward trend in cases. Equally, the government needed to get Americans on board with public health advice, such as frequent hand washing, social distancing and wearing face masks.

Other states fell far short but reopened anyway. We now see the results,\u201d Barry wrote. Adding to the gloom, states are now reporting some of the shortages that dogged hospitals back in March, such as testing kits and personal protective equipment. Post-testing support \u2014 making sure those who test positive self-isolate and following up their contacts \u2014 has fallen short of the needed effort. \u201cMany states now have so many cases that contact tracing has become impossible anyway,\u201d Barry wrote. To reopen the economy safely, and to reopen schools safely, requires getting the case count down to manageable levels, mimicking those in Europe, which is now ready to bring children back into its schools. That will require limits on gatherings and temporary shutdowns of places where people tend to congregate in large numbers. That means not just bars, but also churches, which are a well-documented source of spread. In some instances, a full shutdown may be required, said Barry, as half measures will do little to stop hospital systems from being overwhelmed. See:Florida suffers record single-day COVID-19 death toll, but CDC\u2019s Redfield won\u2019t blame DeSantis\u2019s brisk reopening of state \u201cDuring the 1918 influenza pandemic, almost every city closed down much of its activity. Fear and caring for sick family members did the rest; absenteeism even in war industries exceeded 50 percent and eviscerated the economy. Many cities reopened too soon and had to close a second time \u2014 sometimes a third time \u2014 and faced intense resistance. But lives were saved,\u201d said Barry. The U.S. has a second chance to attack the virus, but may not have a third, he concluded. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get the growth of this pandemic under control now, in a few months, when the weather turns cold and forces people to spend more time indoors, we could face a disaster that dwarfs the situation today,\u201d he said.
