BioNTech and Pfizer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s candidates, BN1162b2 and BNT162b2, need to be stored in negative 94 degrees Fahrenheit. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese storage conditions would make traditional office or pharmacy administration very difficult,\u00e2\u0080\u009d SVB Leerink analysts wrote in a note to investors on Thursday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese conditions could be met at tertiary hospitals and laboratories and could be accommodated in intensive one-day vaccination events at such sites, but this would still only cover a fraction of the healthy population.\u00e2\u0080\u009d See also:Moderna\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stock rises after it says COVID-19 vaccine candidate produced antibodies in older patients Officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said they are aware of the issue. Dr. Kathleen Dooling, a medical officer for the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s division of viral diseases, said Wednesday that storage, distribution, and handling requirements of these vaccines \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill make it very difficult for community clinics and local pharmacies to store and administer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She also noted that most vaccines will have to be \u00e2\u0080\u009cadministered at centralized sites with adequate equipment and high throughput.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pfizer will need to use ultralow temperature freezers and thermal shipper storage for its COVID-19 vaccine candidates, according to comments made by Dr. Nicholas Kitchin, senior director of Pfizer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vaccine clinical research and development group. The vaccines being developed by Moderna, BioNTech, and Pfizer are mRNA vaccines; however, other types of vaccines require less intense rules around storage. Concern about the difficulties of storing and shipping mMRNA COVID-19 vaccines to hundreds of millions of people could put the makers of these candidates at a competitive disadvantage, analysts say. It may also separate Moderna\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vaccine from the ones being developed by BioNTech and Pfizer.
