Greg Abbott said Thursday he is pausing the reopening of the state as it responds to a spike in cases of COVID-19 and hospitalizations. Businesses that were allowed reopen under previous phases of reopening can still operate at the designated capacity levels and under health protocols provided by the Texas Department of State Health Services. \"As we experience an increase in both positive COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations, we are focused on strategies that slow the spread of this virus while also allowing Texans to continue earning a paycheck to support their families,\" the governor said in a statement. He called on Texans to wear face masks, wash their hands frequently and socially distance."}]}
