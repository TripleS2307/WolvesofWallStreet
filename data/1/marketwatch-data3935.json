Phil Murphy joined his New York and Connecticut peers, Andrew Cuomo and Ned Lamont, in imposing a 14-day quarantine on travelers from states with rising COVID-19 cases. Trump traveled this week to coronavirus hot spot Arizona for an event with young supporters at a Phoenix megachurch and a brief southern-border visit, during which he and other officials inked signatures on a section of wall. Cases have also been on the rise in Oklahoma, where Trump traveled last weekend for a rally in Tulsa that drew 6,200 supporters, who were to some extent able to socially distance because the arena\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capacity is 19,000 and a larger outdoor appearance was canceled when the expected audience failed to materialize. At least eight staffers who traveled to Tulsa for the event have tested positive for having contracted the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 disease. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnyone who is in close proximity to [Trump], including staff, guests, and press are tested for COVID-19 and confirmed to be negative,\u00e2\u0080\u009d explained Deere of the Bedminster decision. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe president takes the health and safety of everyone traveling in support of himself and all White House operations very seriously.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Murphy appeared to sign off on Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s planned visit to his state during a CNN interview, characterizing the president as, by definition, an excepted essential worker."}]}
