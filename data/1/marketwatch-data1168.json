The WHO has been conducting a multi-pronged clinical trial testing a handful of potential treatments in hospitalized COVID-19 patients since late March. \"These interim trial results show that hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir produce little or no reduction in the mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients when compared to standard of care,\" the organization said in a news release. The WHO had previously halted the hydroxychloroquine arm over safety concerns, restarted it, and then stopped it again; however, there is mounting clinical evidence that hydroxychloroquine, a decades-old antimalarial, is not effective treatment for severely ill COVID-19 patients. The Food and Drug Administration on June 15 withdrew its emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, and the National Institutes of Health also stopped its own study of the drug."}]}
