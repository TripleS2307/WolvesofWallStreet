That\u2019s important because September\u2019s reputation as a poor month for equities is well-known. Since the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% was created in the late 1800s, the Dow has fallen an average of 1% in September. The Dow\u2019s gain in all other months averages 0.7%. There are nevertheless two reasons not to give any weight to this history: \u2022 There is no plausible theory for why September should be awful for the stock market, and without such an explanation, data mining becomes far more likely. \u2022 In any case, the stock market has not, on average, lost ground in September of presidential election years. Read:The biggest problem in the stock market: Bullishness is clouding investors\u2019 thinking The lack of a plausible explanation for September\u2019s record is not for want of trying. For many years I have challenged readers to propose one. None that I have received can withstand historical scrutiny. One of the most widely proposed ideas is that September\u2019s record is caused by tax-loss selling from mutual funds, especially since 1990, because of a new tax law that took effect then. But if that were a plausible explanation, we\u2019d expect September\u2019s record since 1990 to be worse than it was before. But that\u2019s not the case. The Dow\u2019s average September loss prior to 1990 was four times worse than it\u2019s been since then \u2014 minus 1.2% versus minus 0.3%. Other explanations that have been proposed don\u2019t even meet a simple smell test. One of my favorites is that the stock market in September suffers from pent-up selling from investors who are just returning from their summer vacations. But that explanation could just as easily be turned on its head; why doesn\u2019t the market soar in September from pent-up buying demand? That could especially be the case this year, given the Federal Reserve\u2019s announcement Thursday suggesting its monetary policy will be even easier than previously thought, for a lot longer than previously thought. The so-called Fed Put is alive and well. In any case, according to Lawrence Tint, it\u2019s a waste of time trying to find a plausible explanation for September\u2019s dismal record. Tint is the former U.S. CEO of BGI, the organization that created iShares (now part of BlackRock BLK, +1.18% ). \u201cUnless you or I are able to discover something nobody else knows about, by the time we know why a pattern exists, it\u2019s too late to profit from it,\u201d he said in an interview. That\u2019s because, once this discovery is made, \u201csavvy investors would immediately begin jumping the gun by selling in August, others in turn would try to beat them, and the historical pattern would quickly disappear.\u201dElection-year September If the discussion up to this point isn\u2019t sufficient to convince you not to fear September, consider this: In September of the average presidential-election year, the stock market actually has risen. This is illustrated in the accompanying chart at the top of this column, which plots the Dow\u2019s average monthly gains back to 1896. Notice that, in presidential-election years, not only does the Dow on average rise in September, but there are also five months that have the worst average returns. So there you have it. There is no sound theoretical or statistical reason to bet that September is bad for the stock market. But even if there were, you\u2019d still have reason in this election year not to bet on equities suffering in September. None of this is a guarantee the stock market won\u2019t fall. With five straight months of gains under its belt, the stock market has every right to take a breather \u2014 especially in a crazy year like 2020 that has already broken so many historical precedents. My point is that, should the stock market decline, it won\u2019t be because it\u2019s the ninth month of the calendar. Mark Hulbert is a columnist for MarketWatch.
