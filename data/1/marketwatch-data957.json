Or should the doors swing open as if all the danger has disappeared? As the politicians and pundits leap one way or the other, people on the front lines of America\u2019s largest public-school system are speaking out from hard experience: Only a politician or a pundit would choose either of those simple-minded extremes. \u201c \u201cEvery parent I know is freaking out.\u201d \u201d \u2014 Sarah Garland, executive editor of the Hechinger Report and a Brooklyn mom The only reasonable plan for September, the people who really know say, is a \u201chybrid\u201d system where students return to the classroom two or three days a week. \u201cParents are eager to send the kiddos back to school\u2014of course, they are,\u201d said Ricardo Colon, an instructional coach (a teacher of teachers) at PS/IS 30, a large and diverse K-8 school in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. \u201cBut safety first and foremost. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important we get these details right.\u201d \u201cThere is no plan for opening with all the kids coming back in together,\u201d said Michael Mulgrew, president of the United Federation of Teachers, the union representing 75,000 New York teachers, 19,000 classroom paraprofessionals and assorted other school personnel. \u201cThat would mean we couldn\u2019t do the safety procedures that are the minimum we need to keep the school community safe.\u201d By school community, Mulgrew means the children, the teachers and also the families they all go home to. That\u2019s a lot of people\u20141.1 million students alone. It\u2019s one big, interconnected web. \u201cIt\u2019s a series of bad choices we are facing,\u201d said Brooklyn mom Sarah Garland, still frazzled from three months of \u201cdistance learning\u201d with a 5- and 6-year-old. \u201cEvery parent I know is freaking out.\u201d They are keenly aware of the health risks of packing school buildings as a deadly infection still rages. But after the abrupt suspension of classroom teaching on March 15, \u201cas a parent, it\u2019s hard not to feel, \u2018Please, take my kid for five days a week.\u2019 I had no idea how hard it was to teach a child to write\u2014and I\u2019m a writer!\u201d Along with her recent conscription as a home-school instructor, Garland is also executive editor of the Hechinger Report, a nonprofit newsroom based at Teachers College, Columbia University, that has won praise for its savvy coverage of education issues across the U.S. \u201cThis is tough for everyone,\u201d she said. \u201cBut for needier populations, not having schools open is devastating. So the question is, \u2018How do we do it safely?\u2019\u201d Like mask-wearing, large gatherings and so much else about the coronavirus crisis, the debate over school reopening has been sharply politicized. President Donald Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and some others are demanding a full return to classes after the summer break, saying the economy requires it. Washington Democrats, state and local officials from both parties and most public-health experts, including the top leaders at the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have been urging greater caution. Infection rates are still shooting up in many states, they note. See: Trump threatens federal funding for schools, says he disagrees with CDC over reopening guidelines But the people closest to the schools\u2014parents, teachers and the local officials who run them\u2014are tuning out the divisive rhetoric and tackling the thousands of crucial details that must be resolved. \u201cI\u2019m talking to teachers all the time,\u201d said Colon, whose school has the city\u2019s only English-Arabic bilingual curriculum. \u201cWe knew we couldn\u2019t wait for City Hall to solve this. We\u2019ve been working on it since April 1. We have the rudimentary outlines of what it will be. If we get the resources and support we need, we can make it work in September.\u201d Get ready for fewer kids in a classroom, he said. Desks and other furnishings that can keep everyone separated (after years of team learning and enhanced collaboration). Sanitizer and cleaning supplies everywhere. Lunch is still a question mark. And masks. Lots of masks. See: Under proposed plan, NYC students to attend in-person classes two or three times a week in September \u201cWe\u2019re talking about kids,\u201d Colon said. \u201cYou know some of those masks are ending up on the floor. We need extra supplies of everything.\u201d So will this really happen? Will the New York schools be ready? Doesn\u2019t the virus get a vote? \u201cIf we remain on our current trajectory on the virus,\u201d said the union\u2019s Mulgrew, \u201cyes, this is realistic.\u201d But whatever plan\u2019s in place for the first day of school in September, it will almost certainly need to be adjusted in the days and weeks after that. \u201cWe have to take advantage of new information on the science side,\u201d Mulgrew said. \u201cThere\u2019s testing. And contact tracing. We\u2019ll be ready, but we\u2019ll still be filling in the pieces as we go along.\u201d Ellis Henican is an author based in New York City and a former newspaper columnist."}]}
