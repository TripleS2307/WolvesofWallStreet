The work they do is just absolutely amazing, and I want to thank them all.\" Trump, 74, was moved from the White House to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center late Friday, the same day that he and First Lady Melania Trump announced they had tested positive for coronavirus. His medical regimen highlighted how the president is in a high-risk group for more serious illness from COVID-19. \u201c 'Every single person in the vehicle during that completely unnecessary Presidential \"drive-by\" just now has to be quarantined for 14 days.' \u201d - James Phillips, a doctor of emergency medicine at George Washington University and attending physician at Walter Reed Fox News journalist Lou Dobbs tweeted his support for the president, if not for his decision to leave the hospital. \"Gotta love our President! A bad patient, but a great leader,\" Dobbs wrote. James Clapper, a former director of national intelligence, speculated to CNN that Trump is likely concerned about optics, particularly given that he's in the middle of an election campaign. \"Let's hope this comports with his rate of improvement,\" he said. However, James Phillips, a doctor of emergency medicine at George Washington University who is also an attending physician at Walter Reed, tweeted his dismay at the president leaving his hospital room to greet supporters from his motorcade. \"Every single person in the vehicle during that completely unnecessary Presidential 'drive-by' just now has to be quarantined for 14 days,\" he said. \"They might get sick. They may die. For political theater. Commanded by Trump to put their lives at risk for theater. This is insanity.\" Phillips added in a subsequent tweet: \"That Presidential SUV is not only bulletproof, but hermetically sealed against chemical attack. The risk of COVID19 transmission inside is as high as it gets outside of medical procedures. The irresponsibility is astounding. My thoughts are with the Secret Service forced to play.\" iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Jonathan Reiner, the director of the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory at the George Washington University Hospital and a professor of medicine at GWU Medical Center, also expressed concern at the president leaving the hospital in light of his condition. \"In the hospital when we go into close contact with a Covid patient we dress in full PPE: Gown, gloves, N95, eye protection, hat. This is the height of irresponsibility,\" he said. Trump was given a dose of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s REGN, +0.36%  experimental neutralizing antibody cocktail, in addition to Gilead Sciences Inc.'s GILD, +0.82%  remdesivir. The president also received supplemental oxygen at least once, and dexamethasone, Dr. Sean Conley, Trump's physician, said Sunday. Dexamethasone is a common steroid that has demonstrated in clinical trials in the U.K. that it can reduce mortality in severely ill COVID-19 patients. \u201c 'Gotta love our President! A bad patient, but a great leader.' \u201d - Fox News journalist Lou Dobbs Asked by a reporter at a news conference outside Walter Reed on Sunday why he appeared to underplay certain aspects of the president's condition, Conley replied, \"That's a good question. So I was trying to reflect the upbeat attitude that the team, the president, that his course of illness has had. I didn't want to give any information that might steer the course of illness in another direction and, in doing so, it came off that we're trying to hide something, which wasn't necessarily true.\" He added, \"The fact of the matter is that he's doing really well. ... He is responding, and as the team said, if everything continues to go well, we're going to start discharge planning back to the White House.\" Dexamethasone is a type of corticosteroid that has been considered a treatment only for severely ill COVID-19 patients. \"Corticosteroids also appear to be associated with benefit among critically ill patients with COVID-19 whether they are receiving mechanical ventilation or oxygen without mechanical ventilation,\" researchers wrote in September in a JAMA editorial. Still, Trump appeared upbeat in his Twitter video address Sunday evening. Observers said it could indeed be an indication of his improved condition, or a temporary boost of energy from steroids he has received. Health professionals caution of the perniciousness of COVID-19, which they say is unpredictable and can leave the patient feeling up one day, but much worse the next.

Also Sunday, Trump said he was learning a lot about COVID-19 during his stay at Walter Reed. \"It's been a very interesting journey. I've learned a lot about COVID. I learned it by really going to school,\" he said. \"This is the real school. This isn't the 'Let's read the book' school, and I get it and I understand it, and it's a very interesting thing and I'm going to be letting you know about it.\" Related: Here's how Trump's positive coronavirus test has shaken up the campaign - plus what could happen next Dr. Sean Conley, physician to President Donald Trump, briefs reporters at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., Oct. 3.
