How did major indexes fare? The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% fell 86.11 points, or 0.3%, to end at 27,844.91, or 5.8% away from its all-time record close. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% rose 9.14 points, or 0.3%, closing at 3,381.99, only 0.1% away from its record closing peak at 3,386.15. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.39% added 110.42 points, or 1%, finishing at 11,129.73, while booking its 33rd record close of the year. Read:If history repeats, the stock market will set a new high by the end of August On Friday, the Dow gained 1.8% for the week, the S&P 500 booked a weekly advance of 0.6%. Friday\u2019s gain turned the Nasdaq barely positive for the week, up 0.1%. What drove the market? The tech-heavy Nasdaq set a fresh record close Monday, even as strategists say a broader market rally outside of high-flying technology stocks likely will be needed for the S&P 500 to make a sustained push above its prior record. \u201cToday we\u2019re still looking at this headwind around another fiscal package being passed, and some skepticism about that getting done,\u201d said Joe Quinlan, head of chief investment office market strategy at Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank, in an interview. \u201cBut the key is breadth,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to see that improve.\u201d Moves for the equity market come against the backdrop of failed negotiations between Democrats and Republicans centered on advancing a new package of aid to help laborers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic after $600 a week in unemployment assistance were halted at the end of last month. \u201cWhile aid for state and local governments and enhanced unemployment aid remain the most contentious issues, funding for the USPS ahead of mail-in voting has emerged as a new issue,\u201d Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide, wrote in a note. With the U.S. Postal Service now in the spotlight, House Democrats on Monday said they would vote Saturday on a bill to bar operational changes at the agency that could slow mail service ahead of the Nov. 3 election, while injecting it with $25 billion in additional funding. Despite tensions in Washington, some on Wall Street remain hopeful that a V-shaped, or quick and powerful, recovery still can be achieved, particularly if the coronavirus can be contained across the U.S. \u201cThere\u2019s enough fiscal stimulus in the pipeline that we think the economy continues to heal in the third and fourth quarters,\u201d Quinlan said. The U.S. reported just over 42,000 new COVID-19 cases for Sunday, down from a one-week average of 51,523 daily cases, according to New York Times data. The nation\u2019s total number of cases surpassed 5.4 million, about a quarter of the worldwide total. Elsewhere on Monday, New Zealand, where the outbreak has been under control for much of the pandemic, delayed its elections by about a month after an outbreak in Auckland put a third of voters into lockdown. Much of Wall Street also plans to tune into the Democratic National Convention, which begins Monday mostly as a virtual event, for more clues about what policy initiatives could be in play for markets if a Biden administration were to prevail and take over the White House. \u201cThe market is telling you it\u2019s expecting the current administration to stay in place,\u201d Jason Ader, chief executive officer at SpringOwl Asset Management, told MarketWatch. But he also thinks that if the probability of a Democratic administration gains momentum, \u201cthe lower the stock market will go.\u201d In economic reports, a reading on business conditions in the New York area, the Empire State index, fell 13.5 points to 3.7 in August, signaling a slower pace of growth, the regional Fed bank said Monday. Economists had expected a reading of 17, according to a survey by Econoday. The index had surged in July after being in negative territory since the pandemic began. Separately, a report on home-builder confidence was much stronger than expected. Builder confidence in the newly built, single-family home market jumped six points to 78 in August on the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index, with the reading hitting the highest level on record for the report. Builder sentiment plunged to 30 in April. A reading above 50 is considered upbeat. Which stocks were in focus?
