Oregon\u2019s governor, Portland\u2019s mayor and a raft of Democratic senators have launched stinging attacks on the operations. But the use of heavily armed law-enforcement task forces, such as have been drafted into Portland, has for years been supported by U.S. mayors and other politicians, both Democratic and Republican, despite allegations of police overreach and a lack of evidence they lead to improvements in public safety. \u201cThey come in with tanks. They come in dressed for combat. The methods themselves look so much like what you\u2019re seeing in Portland,\u201d said Judith Green, director of Justice Strategies, a research organization in New York. \u201cIf you were standing outside a housing project in the middle of one, you wouldn\u2019t know the difference.\u201d The Justice Department has acknowledged some task-force failures in studies and reports, but it posits these as management problems rather than the failure of a strategy that, when it works, can bring federal and state funding, information sharing, and other benefits to local policing. Critics, though, say agencies sometimes exaggerate problems to justify launching a multijurisdictional task force, and then overreach in their efforts to record a success. \u201cFor exchange of information and resources, I think they are great,\u201d said James Hernandez, a California State University at Sacramento criminal-justice professor specializing in gangs. But \u201csome are hokey as hell.\u201d Read:Legal experts call Portland force deployment a constitutional \u2018red flag,\u2019 while Trump eyes federal actions on Chicago streets In April 2012, Carlos Gamino had just arrived at his Sacramento park maintenance job when he had to rush back home because he learned his daughters had been harmed by a stun grenade thrown by police raiding his house. \u201cThey have an army vehicle. They have cops, and sheriff\u2019s deputies. My one daughter is sitting outside, and she\u2019s had a panic attack where she can\u2019t breathe. She\u2019s handcuffed. I\u2019m trying to get inside, and I\u2019m like, \u2018Show me the warrant.\u2019 They say, \u2018We don\u2019t have to show you anything,\u2019 \u201d said Gamino, describing the scene in a recent interview. Police arrested Gamino as a suspected gang member before releasing him from jail without charges that day, and sent his 16-year-old daughter to the hospital with burns on her legs from a stun grenade. Officers had mistakenly identified Gamino\u2019s home as the residence of his brother, who had left the country years earlier. This was part of the culmination of \u201cOperation Red Sash,\u201d focused on the largely Hispanic Broderick neighborhood of West Sacramento. It involved an anti-land-mine vehicle obtained from the military, SWAT snipers, more than 100 officers from a dozen agencies \u2014 including the Yolo Narcotic Enforcement Team; the Davis, Woodland and West Sacramento police departments; the Yolo County Sheriff\u2019s Department; and the Yolo Gang Task Force \u2014 who served 12 arrest warrants and 16 search warrants, according to a press release from the office of Kamala Harris, California\u2019s attorney general at the time. Harris, now Joe Biden\u2019s vice presidential pick, had been battling proposals from Gov. Jerry Brown to slash funding supporting regional law-enforcement task forces. And she billed Operation Red Sash as a success in her initiative to battle what her office called \u201ctransnational gangs.\u201d \u201cToday\u2019s operation will cripple these criminal street gangs and their criminal enterprise network,\u201d Harris said in a statement at that time. In the case of Operation Red Sash, the D.A. sought tough sentences based on the idea that the alleged crimes of those charged were gang-related. However, juries rejected the idea of gang involvement, and those convicted were mostly given lesser sentences for crimes such as drug dealing. Harris was hardly unique in putting gloss on a task-force operation. Politicians nationwide have claimed that task forces have routed, crippled or eliminated a particular type of misfeasor. \u201cIt\u2019s a political thing,\u201d said John Raphling, a criminal-justice researcher with Human Rights Watch. \u201cThey\u2019re using the shock value, the visceral reaction to \u2018gang\u2019 to justify funding these useless, and ultimately harmful, operations.\u201d For local officials, a multijurisdictional law-enforcement task force is often seen as all bonus, no onus. Typically, such an operation \u201cadds resources and removes accountability,\u201d said Raphling. Rick Gore, a former investigator with the district attorney\u2019s office in Yolo County, which had led Operation Red Sash, described task-force operations there as a way to grow budgets: \u201cGrant money is a huge incentive to grow departments. When you hire more detectives, more supervisors, more cases, [you] need more assistant district attorneys, you need more supervising district attorneys, your office grows, and you can put on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that you went from a 40-person office to 650.\u201d Patrick Jaicomo, an attorney with the Institute for Justice, said politicians \u201chave to justify the funding, and so they have to be active on this issue,\u201d he said. \u201cIf your task force is tasked with arresting a certain number of people, or finding a certain amount of drugs, you don\u2019t think twice about raiding someone\u2019s house at 3 a.m. Why not raid five houses? It leads to a mind-set where you do whatever it is you can think of to achieve the goal.\u201d Through a spokeswoman, Yolo County\u2019s sheriff declined to comment on Operation Red Sash. Yolo County\u2019s district attorney, through a spokeswoman, declined to comment, saying Kamala Harris was responsible for the operation. Sen. Harris\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to phone calls nor emailed questions.

The Drug Enforcement Administration, one of many federal and state organizations coordinating law-enforcement task forces, reports managing 271 task forces involving 5,000 federal and state officers. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, for its part, counts 160 gang task forces involved around the country. There is no official tally of spending on these types of operations. But a 2014 report by the Brennan Center for Justice said the federal government sends at least $3.8 billion in federal criminal-justice grants across the country, largely for task-force operations. Billions more are sent through national-security programs run by the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security, the report said. And this doesn\u2019t include state, local and regional agency budgets, which also contribute significant funds and resources to task-force operations. \u201cThese task forces are operating in every community in the country,\u201d said Jaicomo. Despite the vast expense, critics say there has been scant effort to evaluate whether the task forces actually reduce the problems they were set up to solve. The idea has been to pick a single crime topic of public concern \u2014 gangs, narcotics, terrorism and the like \u2014 and rather than have local agencies addressing crimes as they arise, attacking a single problem by assembling teams and equipment from various agencies to conduct surveillance, raids, arrests and trials. Read:John Oliver explains \u2018defund the police\u2019 \u2014 and why it doesn\u2019t mean \u2018no police\u2019 In 2007, a report for the Justice Department detailed how task forces could do a better job of figuring out whether their efforts reduced crime or other problems. Up to that point, the report\u2019s author said in an interview, they took stock largely of things such as the number of arrests or gun seizures made. The following year the Justice Department produced guidelines, again recommending \u201cperformance measurement\u201d gauging whether they\u2019d done any good. But there is little incentive to measure whether these operations reduce the problems they are set up to deal with, according to the 2014 Brennan Center report. Grants to local law-enforcement agencies base funding on activities such as arrests, seizures and prosecutions, rather than proof of increased public safety per dollar spent. This \u201cinadvertently creates incentives to increase arrests,\u201d the report said, adding that hundreds of federal grant programs \u201cprovide additional dollars while slipping the leash of accountability and clear direction.\u201d Subsequent studies analyzing law-enforcement task forces found a similar information vacuum. FBI analyst Laura Jamison found that \u201cthere is no system or requirement to measure performance, aside from criminal statistics, nor even a clear definition of success,\u201d according to her December 2019 paper \u201cMeasuring Performance Within Anti-Gang Task Forces in Texas.\u201d Experts who have immersed themselves in individual task-force operations have found problems similar to those of Operation Red Sash, where overwhelming use of force was followed by underwhelming outcomes. In February 2008, hundreds of officers from nine different agencies descended on the largely Black Oakwood neighborhood of Los Angeles to, according to a press release from Democratic City Attorney Rocky Delgadillo, stop narcotics gangs from terrorizing the community. The raid on two dozen homes left plenty of community members terrified, Raphling said. \u201cThey invaded the neighborhood. They had armored vehicles and 300 officers. They put hooks on window bars and broke windows, kicked down doors. In one instance, they kicked down a door, baby sleeping, just missed falling down on the baby. They rousted everybody and handcuffed people outside their houses. And they didn\u2019t come up with shit,\u201d he said. In a response to an inquiry, a spokesman for current City Attorney Michael Feuer said he \u201chas nothing to say about a previous City Attorney\u2019s actions or policies.\u201d In April 2016 the U.S. Justice Department issued a press release heralding the \u201clargest gang takedown in New York history,\u201d by a task force including the City of New York Police Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Nearly 700 officers conducted a dawn raid on the Eastchester Gardens apartments and the surrounding neighborhood in the Bronx with special weapons and tactics teams, tanks and helicopters. At a press conference, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said the U.S. had charged 120 defendants with racketeering, narcotics and firearm offenses. He also said there were allegations of murder, shootings and stabbings. In reality, less than half of the people picked up in the raids were gang members, and some people were actually recharged for crimes they had already been punished for, according to Babe Howell, a law professor at City University of New York who studied the aftermath. Most weren\u2019t charged with violent crimes but rather were dealers of marijuana, cocaine or other drugs. \u201cThey used a small set of homicides in the single digits, some of them already solved, to justify a massive takedown,\u201d Howell said. \u201cThey were prosecuting non\u2013gang members in a gang takedown, and admitting that they reprosecuted people for offenses they were already punished for.\u201d The Justice Department responded in a statement, highlighting violent criminals arrested in the raid and adding that it is possible to charge non\u2013gang members with gang racketeering because they sometimes help gangs. When locally applied sentences for the same crime are too short to deter gang activity, they can be revisited under federal anti-racketeering laws, the statement said. A federal officer pepper sprays a protester on July 20 in front of the Mark O. Hatfield United States Courthouse in Portland. Getty Images Read:Portland remains tense after mayor is among those tear-gassed by federal agents In Portland in May, much as in cities all over the country, several hundred protesters gathered along a six-block stretch of street emanating north from the Willamette River to denounce the police killing of George Floyd. On June 23 a group organized a march commemorating two men who had been killed defending Black teenage girls from racist epithets. Portland protesters surrounded a police station, and later the headquarters of the local police union. Some people set fire to a downtown sculpture of an elk. \u201cDaily protests have regularly been followed by nightly criminal activity in the form of vandalism, destruction of property, looting, arson, and assault,\u201d wrote a U.S. Federal Protective Service agent in a criminal affidavit accusing two protesters of interfering with officers\u2019 job of defending federal buildings. On July 4 dozens of federal agents in camouflage and riot gear formed around the building housing Portland\u2019s federal courts. And for the next three weeks, scenes of flash-bang grenades, fireworks, tear gas, injured protesters and agents spiriting away a protester in an unmarked van dominated America\u2019s national conversation. Agents arrested 60 protesters. Federal prosecutors charged 46 with crimes such as arson, property damage and assault. On July 31, \u201cOperation Diligent Valor\u201d withdrew from the downtown area. Experts studying less-noticed task-force operations say they have seen many of these elements before. \u201cThe aggressive manner in which these operations are carried out, with little concern for the actual impact on the community, strikes me as similar,\u201d said Raphling of Human Rights Watch. Added Howell, the CUNY law professor: \u201cThey\u2019re able to say, \u2018We are the white hat coming into the local jurisdiction and taking care of your street-crime problems.\u2019 \u201d Matt Smith reports for MarketWatch and Barron\u2019s Group from San Francisco."}]}
