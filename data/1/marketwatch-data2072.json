They are known as \u201csell-side analysts.\u201d They work independently of the firms\u2019 sales teams, but there\u2019s no question that Wall Street\u2019s job is to sell stocks. So when you see a high level of \u201csell\u201d ratings on a stock, take heed. Tesla Inc. TSLA, +1.89% is the poster child for high-flying stocks during this pandemic year. The electric-car company\u2019s shares are up 435% this year and 891% in the past 12 months. And as the shares have shot up, many analysts have continually increased their price targets. But not all of them have kept doing so. And now, among 37 sell-side analysts polled by FactSet, eight rate the shares the equivalent of a \u201cbuy,\u201d while 11 rate them the equivalent of a \u201csell.\u201d The shares closed at $447.37 on Sept. 2. The consensus price target among those analysts is $284.97, implying 36% downside for the shares. Tesla is not yet included in the benchmark S&P 500 Index SPX, +0.87%, although it is expected to be added soon. It is rare for any S&P 500 stock to have majority \u201csell\u201d ratings, and none do at this time. But a quick look shows 33 stocks with \u201csell\u201d ratings outweighing \u201cbuy\u201d ratings. Expanding to the Russell 1000 Index RUI, +0.88% of the largest 1,000 publicly traded companies listed in the U.S. by market capitalization (including Tesla and subject to changes when stocks plunge), there are four companies with majority \u201csell\u201d ratings. Among the Russell 1000, there are 63 companies with \u201csell\u201d ratings outweighing \u201cbuy\u201d ratings. Here they are, sorted by market capitalization: Company Ticker Share 'buy' ratings Share 'sell' ratings Market cap. ($ millions) Total return - 2020 through Sept. 2 Tesla Inc.
