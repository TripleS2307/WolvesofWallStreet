Tesla TSLA, +1.89% shares fell on Friday but garnered a weekly gain of 5.6%. The shares closed at a record $1,025.05 on Wednesday. Tesla\u2019s valuation has swollen to more than $170 billion, and at the height of the week\u2019s rally the company was briefly the world\u2019s most-valued car maker after Toyota Motor Corp. TM, -0.65% 7203, -0.95%. Toyota\u2019s valuation hovered at $208 billion on Friday. Wednesday\u2019s surge came after a leaked memo from Elon Musk showed the chief executive urging the company to go \u201call out\u201d on the Tesla Semi and bring the freight truck to volume production amid intense investor interest in competitor Nikola Corp. NKLA, -1.36%, an Arizona-based electric-truck startup that went public last week. The Goldman analysts said they continued to hold a \u201cpositive\u201d long-term view of Tesla, but the shares are trading above their 12-month price target of $950, upped on Friday. Recent data points on Tesla have been mixed, the analysts said. Negatives include Tesla recently cutting prices on several models, which was unexpected, and compressed lead times for Model Y deliveries. On the other hand, there has been new government financing assistance for electric-vehicles in Europe, and Tesla had \u201csolid\u201d May deliveries in China. \u201cWe\u2019d look to become more positive on Tesla stock again if we had more confidence in the near to intermediate term trajectory of fundamentals, or if valuation became more attractive,\u201d the Goldman analysts said. The analysts, led by Mark Delaney, downgraded Tesla to neutral. In the same report, they also upgraded General Motors Co. GM, -0.15% to buy, saying GM is in a \u201csolid position\u201d in the U.S. pickup truck market as well as the Chinese market. Analysts at Morgan Stanley marked down Tesla for risks to the trade between the U.S. and China, for concerns about near-term demand, and the company\u2019s ongoing capital needs. Those are \u201ckey bear vectors\u201d markets might be ignoring, the analysts, led my Adam Jonas, said. Morgan Stanley downgraded Tesla stock to their equivalent of sell, from neutral, and shaved its price target on the shares to $650 from $680. Tesla shares have gained 121% so far this year, contrasting with losses of 4.6% and 11% for the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% in the same period."}]}
