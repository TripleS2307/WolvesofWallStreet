(AP) \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence has canceled plans to attend a Trump campaign fundraiser in Montana following revelations that the event\u2019s hosts had expressed support for the QAnon conspiracy theory. President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign told the Associated Press on Saturday that Pence\u2019s schedule had been changed, but the campaign did not provide a reason or say whether the fundraiser might be held at a later time. The change comes after the AP reported Wednesday that hosts Cayrn and Michael Borland in Bozeman, Mont., had shared QAnon memes and retweeted posts from QAnon accounts. The baseless conspiracy theory alleges Trump is battling an entrenched bureaucracy and sex trafficking ring run by pedophiles.

Steve Daines, who faces a November challenge from Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock; U.S. Rep. Greg Gianforte, a Republican running for governor; and state auditor Matt Rosendale, a candidate for the U.S. House. Pence, Daines and the other Republican candidates are still scheduled to hold a campaign rally Monday afternoon in Belgrade, near Bozeman. Pence will host a rally earlier in the day in Wisconsin, an event that was added as a substitute for the fundraiser, the Trump campaign said. Daines campaign spokesperson Julia Doyle said the first-term senator does not know the Borlands nor \u201cdoes he know what QAnon even is.\u201d Mike Pence speaks during a campaign rally.

Mike Cooney in November, also does not know the Borlands or what QAnon is, spokesman Travis Hall said. A Rosendale spokesman said he was unaware of QAnon. Rosendale \u201cisn\u2019t focused on false conspiracy theories and the attempts of liberal extremists to smear the President,\u201d spokesman Andy Westberry said in an email. He declined to say if Rosendale knows the Borlands. \u201c President Donald Trump has refused to condemn QAnon, recently telling reporters that the conspiracy theory is \u2018gaining in popularity\u2019 and enthusing that its supporters \u2018like me very much.\u2019 \u201d The Borlands have donated over $220,000 to Trump\u2019s re-election bid, the bulk of which was made in Caryn Borland\u2019s name, and they were guests at the national GOP convention last month. The QAnon narrative has grown to include other long-standing conspiracy theories, gaining traction among some extreme Trump supporters. The movement is often likened to a right-wing cult. Some followers have run for office, primarily in the Republican Party, though some have been independent or run as third-party candidates. The president has refused to condemn QAnon, recently telling reporters that the conspiracy theory is \u201cgaining in popularity\u201d and that its supporters \u201clike me very much.\u201d Pence has said it\u2019s a conspiracy theory and last month told CBS, \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about QAnon, and I dismiss it out of hand.\u201d The Borlands have shared multiple QAnon social media posts, as well as other discredited conspiracies. Michael Borland prominently featured several QAnon \u201cQ\u201d logos on his Facebook FB, +0.26% page. Caryn Borland has retweeted or engaged with QAnon Twitter TWTR, -0.23% accounts. In April, she responded to a pro-Trump Tweet from a QAnon account by replying \u201cAlways\u201d with a praying-hands emoji. The Borlands did not return telephone messages Saturday seeking comment."}]}
