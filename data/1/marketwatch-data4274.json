VXRT, +0.97% said Friday its oral COVID-19 vaccine has been selected to take part in a non-human primate challenge study funded by the U.S. government's 'Operation Warp Speed' program, that aims to accelerate development of a vaccine. The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of the candidate. Chief Executive Andrei Floroiu said it's the only oral candidate in the program. \"SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, is primarily transmitted by viral particles that enter through the mucosa - nose, mouth or eyes - strongly suggesting that mucosal immunity could serve as the first line of defense,\" he said in a statement. \"In addition, our vaccine is a room temperature-stable tablet, an enormous logistical advantage in large vaccination campaigns.\" Vaxart shares soared 75% premarket on the news. The stock has skyrocketed since the start of the year and is up more than 1,600%."}]}
