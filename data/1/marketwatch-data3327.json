Economists surveyed by Econoday had expected a stronger rebound to 44.5 from 32.3 in May. Any reading below 50 indicates worsening conditions. In the details, production and new orders saw gains, while supplier delivery and employment declined. In a special question, more than half of the manufacturers plan a hiring freeze, while only 18% project expanding their workforce. The Chicago PMI is the last of the regional manufacturing indices before the national ISM data for June is released on Wednesday."}]}
