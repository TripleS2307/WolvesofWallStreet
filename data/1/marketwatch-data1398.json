On Wednesday, members of the House of Representatives will roll out evidence their staffs have found and put pressure directly on some of the most prominent executives in the world. Four of tech\u2019s most prominent chief executives \u2014 Sundar Pichai of Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, +1.82% GOOG, +1.97% , Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +3.01% , Tim Cook of Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.74% and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook Inc. FB, +0.26% \u2014 are scheduled to answer questions from lawmakers about their business practices and enormous influence over the economy and Americans\u2019 day-to-day life. (The hearing, originally scheduled for Monday, was delayed until Wednesday due to plans for the late Rep. John Lewis to lie in state at the U.S. Capitol.) Appearing via video links, the quartet \u2014 whose companies are collectively worth $5 trillion \u2014 should expect withering queries and statements from the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee as investigations into their business practices by the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission deepen. Senior subcommittee aides held a call with members of the media on Thursday and outlined their planned approach. Armed with 1.3 million documents collected from the companies and third-party sources, the subcommittee will be \u201claser focused\u201d on competition and whether current law can adequately keep their power in check, the aides said. One line of questioning they mentioned will deal with the mountains of personal data collected and used by the companies to build their formidable market share. A report based on the CEOs\u2019 testimony is due later this year \u2014 as early as late summer. \u201cSince last June, the Subcommittee has been investigating the dominance of a small number of digital platforms and the adequacy of existing antitrust laws and enforcement. Given the central role these corporations play in the lives of the American people, it is critical that their CEOs are forthcoming. As we have said from the start, their testimony is essential for us to complete this investigation,\u201d House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline, D-R.I., said in a joint statement on Saturday. Amazon declined comment. Facebook, Apple, and Alphabet did not reply to emails seeking comment. Bezos and his corporate brethren are under the regulatory microscope for the considerable sway they hold over multiple markets, ranging from shopping (via Amazon and Google), entertainment (Apple and Google\u2019s YouTube), news and how-to tutorials (Google search), and socializing (Facebook). The steep ascent of Big Tech, which is fueling a resurgent stock market despite a deepening pandemic, underscores the enduring power of the industry as consumption escalates in a work-from-home economy.

Last week, Apple issued third-party economic research showing fees it collects from developers are in line with those charged by other digital platforms \u2014 a possible preview of Cook\u2019s testimony. The company\u2019s App Store, which hauls in about $15 billion in annual revenue according to analysts, gets a 30% cut of sales and strongly influences how developers market and price apps. Because it is the only app store available on more than 900 million iPhones worldwide, it collects roughly twice the sales as its largest rival, Google Play Store. Apple says it collects a portion of sales from a small percentage of the nearly 2 million apps available in the store, which does not make it a monopolist.

TWTR, -0.23% , Snap Inc. SNAP, -0.18% and TikTok in social media. Facebook has consistently called for government regulation in areas where it has been criticized: election integrity, privacy, and harmful content. Bezos, meanwhile, is expected to explain how small sellers on its third-party marketplace platform continue to \u201cthrive despite competition from Amazon\u201d and online purchase options available for consumers. His argument, in essence, is the pandemic has boosted e-commerce overall, including that for large retail rivals like Walmart Inc. WMT, +1.00% , according to a report by Reuters. It remains unclear what Alphabet will say, though it arguably faces the most fierce reception. The company, which reportedly hopes to avert an EU antitrust investigation into its planned $2.1 billion acquisition of Fitbit Inc. FIT, -0.14% by promising not to use Fitbit\u2019s health data to help it target ads, could be sued in the coming months by the Justice Department for alleged abuse of power in the market for advertising technology and search products. The government is also examining allegations that Google abused its dominance in search, according to published reports. The \u201coverhang of regulatory scrutiny\u201d remains a constant source of anxiety for Wall Street with Amazon, Google, Apple, and Facebook expected to be targets of a \u201cpolitical football\u201d between now and the November election, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a research note on Thursday. Ultimately, what conclusions federal lawmakers take from Wednesday\u2019s hearing might come down to a simple question, monopoly expert Stoller said. \u201cIt really comes down to this: How do you become super powerful without answering to anyone?\u201d he said."}]}
