We are in a period of continuous change and uncertainty, making it increasingly important to look at retail activity over time, rather than just one point in time,\u201d said Marshal Cohen, NPD Group\u2019s chief retail industry adviser. \u201cJuly\u2019s loss of Prime Day will bring another layer of change to the 2020 holiday season, with retailers already preparing to compete with the event, effectively moving Black Friday up by more than a month.\u201d Last year, Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s AMZN, +3.01% two-day Prime Day event took place July 15 and July 16. This year, it has been moved to later in the year, though the date has yet to be announced. Analysts have already forecast a bust for this year\u2019s back-to-school shopping season, with many parents and school officials still working out plans See:The back-to-school shopping season will be a \u2018dud\u2019 one analyst says, but the NRF is forecasting a record breaker NPD notes a 3% year-over-year decline in dollar sales for general merchandise items for the week ending Aug. 1 after a surge in coronavirus cases and uncertainty over unemployment benefits leading up to the period. RetailNext hasn\u2019t ruled out the back-to-school shopping season. \u201cIt appears that back-to-school shopping will be popular even in these uncertain times, although it may be in a phased approach,\u201d wrote Susan Davidson, a retail consultant at RetailNext. Cowen analysts also think the back-to-school season will be a more \u201cprolonged\u201d one, but say it will be weakened by the current consumer condition. \u201cCowen anticipates a back-to-school season with fewer apparel purchases that\u2019s highly promotional. Consumers will value versatility, comfort, active apparel, and soft \u2018lock down\u2019 wear,\u201d analysts said. Cowen thinks Ulta Beauty Inc. ULTA, -1.63% will benefit from the shift away from clothing purchases during the season, and favors Target Corp. TGT, +1.14% thanks to its strength in categories away from apparel, like home and beauty. Target reports second-quarter earnings on Wednesday. More than half of the respondents (52%) to the First Insight poll that Cowen hosted said they weren\u2019t going to be buying for back-to-school this year. Also: Stein Mart files for bankruptcy as analysts forecast pressure on usually-robust off-price retail Looking ahead Target, Walmart Inc. WMT, +1.00% and other retailers have already announced store closures on Thanksgiving Day, which has become an important part of the Black Friday shopping weekend. As the calendar moves from back-to-school to holiday, Wells Fargo analysts see three headwinds facing the retail sector: a stalled recovery, the aforementioned uncertainty around unemployment and other government stimulus benefits and holiday season shipping price increases, like those United Parcel Service Inc. UPS, +0.27% announced. \u201cBoth UPS and FedEX have continued to increase pricing (some industry sources citing as much as a double-digit price hike for some retailers) and have announced incremental holiday surcharges,\u201d analysts said. \u201cWith the expectation for a significant channel shift online this holiday season, this could be a meaningful margin headwind in 2H.\u201d Before we get to the holidays, retailers will have to deal with a back-to-school shopping season that doesn\u2019t look like any before it. \u201cWith some families still undecided as to how their children will learn this fall, and many school districts still figuring out if and how to re-open their doors to students safely, the traditional back-to-school shopping timeline may be delayed and traditional back-to-school wallet share may shift,\u201d Wells Fargo said. The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF XLY, +1.04% has gained 16% for the year to date. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF XRT, +0.05% is up 14.6%. And the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% is up 4.7% for the period."}]}
