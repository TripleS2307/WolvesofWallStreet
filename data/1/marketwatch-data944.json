Top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway will leave the White House by the end of the month, the Washington Post first reported Sunday, in the interests of her family. Also Sunday night, her husband, George Conway, an outspoken critic of the president, said he is withdrawing from the anti-Trump Republican group The Lincoln Project and taking a Twitter timeout \"to devote more time to family matters.\" iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } All that came after the couple's 15-year-old daughter, Claudia, tweeted Saturday that she was seeking emancipation from her parents, with whom she has publicly feuded over their conservative politics. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } On Sunday, Claudia, too, said she was taking a Twitter break. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Kellyanne Conway has been one of President Donald Trump's longest-serving advisers and among his most loyal defenders, in stark contrast to her husband, who has been one of Trump's sharpest critics. The polar-opposite stances have been the source of friction for years, according to media reports. She told the Washington Post in 2018 that she thought some of George's anti-Trump tweets were \"disrespectful\" of her and \"a violation of basic decency, certainly, if not marital vows.\" \"We disagree about plenty,\" she said in a statement Sunday, \"but we are united on what matters most: the kids. ... This is completely my choice and my voice. In time, I will announce future plans. For now, and for my beloved children, it will be less drama, more mama.\" As a Twitter farewell, George Conway on Sunday retweeted a \"greatest hits\" list of his many thoughts on Trump, among which was that he's \"a narcissistic sociopath\" and \"a cancer on the presidency.\" iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; }"}]}
