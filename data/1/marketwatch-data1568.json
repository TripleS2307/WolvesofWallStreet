Those of us who remember when \u201980s music was new had better start bracing ourselves for those big-box-store greeter jobs earlier than we expected. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to see that the jobs market is probably heading for a massive, rolling shakeout. And that means plenty of employers may be using the cover of COVID-19 to get rid of lots of expensive older workers. 80% of older Americans can't afford to retire - COVID-19 isn't helping Age discrimination in the jobs market, which is supposedly illegal, goes up in recessions. Some employers take the opportunity to ax experienced workers who are paid a reasonable wage, and replace them with cheap, desperate kids who will put up with anything. This isn\u2019t just my opinion. New research from the National Bureau of Economic Research finds that, yes, age discrimination rises hand in hand with the unemployment rate. Older workers tend to be the last hired back and the first fired. And while the unemployment rate has been dropping back down for the last two months, after the initial COVID shock, you\u2019re a fool if you think it\u2019s over. (OK, that was the \u201970s.) Economists Gordon Dalh of the University of California, San Diego, and Matthew Knepper of the University of Georgia ran the numbers on age-discrimination complaints filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and compared them with the unemployment rates in the relevant industry and U.S. state at the time. Read: Mid-career? Your job is at risk. Here\u2019s what to know \u201cFor each 1 percentage point increase in a state-industry\u2019s monthly unemployment rate, the volume of age discrimination firing and hiring charges increases by 4.8% and 3.4%, respectively,\u201d they found. And that was even more true when they eliminated weaker or possibly frivolous complaints, and looked only at those that the EEOC deemed had merit and deserved further investigation. \u201cEven though the incentive to file weaker claims is stronger when unemployment is high, the fraction of meritorious claims also increases significantly when labor market conditions deteriorate,\u201d they write. Read: You\u2019re likely to be out of a job in your 50s \u2014 4 ways to prepare and minimize the pain Just for good measure, they also ran analyses of a study conducted in 2012 which sent out fake (female) r\u00e9sum\u00e9s across the country in response to job openings. Their findings? \u201cEach one percentage point increase in the local unemployment rate reduces the callback rate for older women by 1.7 percentage points (o\ufb00 a baseline 10.8% callback rate), relative to younger women,\u201d they conclude. That\u2019s about a 16% relative decline in callback rates for each percentage point added to the unemployment rate. (The younger \u201capplicants\u201d were allegedly aged 35 to 42, the older ones over 50, they say.) Bottom line: The higher the unemployment rate, the likelier employers are to favor younger women applicants over older women applicants. \u201cAll else equal, an older female is 6.8 percentage points less likely to receive a callback when she is competing against two additional younger female applicants, which translates to a 63% reduction relative to the mean.\u201d They conclude: \u201cTaken together, our two analyses provide compelling evidence that age discrimination rises as labor markets deteriorate. As far as we know, this is the \ufb01rst direct evidence for age discrimination varying with the business cycle, both for the \ufb01ring and hiring margins.\u201d Oh, great. Technically employers aren\u2019t allowed to discriminate against workers over 40 on the basis of age, thanks to the 1967 Age Discrimination in Employment Act. But it\u2019s honored more in the breach than in the observance. In 2005 the Supreme Court ruled that its protections were pretty narrow. \u201c[M]any employer decisions that are intended to cut costs or respond to market forces will likely have a disproportionate e\ufb00ect on older workers,\u201d and that is legal, wrote Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor for the majority. The stock market and some of the economic data may be pointing upward, but the bond market is telling a different tale and forecasting something in the region of catastrophe. The 10-year Treasury yield is back down to March panic levels. Gold is booming. Tensions are rising between China and the U.S. Also, it slowly seems to be dawning on the world that the virus didn\u2019t just \u201cgo away\u201d because we all hid for a couple of months. Cases have surged from here in the U.S. to China. Restarting the world was always going to lead to the virus\u2019s coming straight back, as the scientists at Imperial College, London, warned way back in March. This is causing some reopening plans to be put on pause, or even into reverse. Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker is reimposing a 14-day quarantine on anyone entering the state. Good times. Let\u2019s hope when this is all over there are actually some stores left hiring greeters."}]}
