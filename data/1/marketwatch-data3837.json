(Photo by Stefani Reynolds/Getty Images) With lawmakers eager to wrap up in Washington and hit the campaign trail, the bright prospects for a deal to keep the government open also mean the pressure for a separate deal on coronavirus aid will likely ease. The Senate may vote as soon as Wednesday or Thursday on the stopgap funding bill to keep the government open past Sept. 30, a so-called continuing resolution. The bill passed the House Tuesday night on an overwhelming 359-57 vote.

John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, told reporters Wednesday, referring to coronavirus aid or the looming Supreme Court nomination. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have given no public signs negotiations have been revived after stalling with the sides $900 billion apart on the size of a deal, much less what should be in it. The legislative calendar is dwindling for much more to be done ahead of the postelection lame duck session. The Senate is not scheduled to return until Wednesday next week and to work through Friday, though most workweeks end on Thursday. Rep. Steny Hoyer, the second-ranking Democrat in the House, told reporters on his weekly press call the House would be in session next week, regardless of whether the CR has been enacted. \u201cWe\u2019re still scheduled to be in next week. We have a lot of pieces of legislation which are not controversial and people don\u2019t know about them, but would be useful to pass, so it\u2019s not as if we have finished the session. We\u2019re not adjourning,\u201d Hoyer said. He said he hoped Democrats would pass a slimmed down version of the $3.4 trillion bill they passed in May to deal with the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has already said Democrats could accept a coronavirus bill at a lower $2.2 trillion level. \u201cThe sooner the better,\u201d said Sen. Richard Shelby, the Alabama Republican who heads the Senate Appropriations Committee, said Wednesday of voting on the stopgap funding bill. \u201cThe CR passed by a big vote yesterday. I think it\u2019s indicative of what we\u2019ll do in the Senate,\u201d he said. Shelby said the odds for a COVID-19 bill were \u201cvery slim,\u201d though he cautioned against completely writing it off. \u201cWe\u2019ve been hearing we\u2019d probably go home this week. And if we don\u2019t, if we\u2019ll come back Wednesday and be here next week, for a little while,\u201d he said, to deal with more presidential nominations."}]}
