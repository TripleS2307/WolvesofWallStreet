On Monday, it proved that is happening \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and then some. Zoom ZM, +2.89% \u00c2 reported another amazing quarter as consumers, schools and all types of businesses continue to use the service while sheltering in place, sending shares up 22% in after-hours trading. While most individuals are using Zoom for free, more companies are signing on for big-money deals. Zoom Chief Executive Eric Yuan touted some major new customers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, -1.47% \u00c2 and Activision Blizzard Inc. ATVI, +0.52% \u00e2\u0080\u0094 during a conference call Monday afternoon. Exxon is using Zoom as its communication platform for its teams, customers and partners around the world, while Activision plans to replace its legacy videoconference products with Zoom.\u00c2 Zoom said that it added 219 customers in the second quarter that spent more than $100,000 each in the trailing 12-month period, its best quarter ever for attracting big-revenue customers. Zoom is approaching 1,000 customers of that size, reaching 988 as of the quarter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s end on July 31. Zoom also said that it expanded on its deal with ServiceNow Inc. NOW, +2.43% \u00c2 , signing the cloud-software company to a deal for Zoom Phone, the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s system to replace legacy PBX systems; with more employees working at home, those PBX systems are often sitting idle while employees use their own phones for work. Zoom expanded that service internationally in the second quarter and launched a hardware-as-a-service offering, which will allow it to sell large corporate clients on more services, and thus drive more sales. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe continue to see growth in the period from both new customers as well as existing customers, and tremendous opportunity with webinar, especially, as well as Zoom Phone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Zoom Chief Financial Officer Kelly Steckelberg told analysts. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe actually signed our largest Zoom Phone deal to date in Q2. So exciting to see that continued momentum.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Smaller customers are growing fast at Zoom too, but they could have a more volatile effect on Zoom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financials. Zoom ended the quarter with about 370,000 customers that have 10 employees or more, adding 105,000 of those in the second quarter, and pushing the smaller companies to 36% of Zoom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revenue, up from 30%. But executives admitted that those customers are showing a greater propensity to \u00e2\u0080\u009cchurn\u00e2\u0080\u009d to other services, and they could more prone to price fluctuations by paying monthly instead of annually. They are also the most obvious targets for Zoom rivals \u00e2\u0080\u0094 like Alphabet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Google Meets GOOG, +1.97% \u00c2 GOOGL, +1.82% \u00c2 , Microsoft Corp.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s MSFT, +2.48% \u00c2 Teams and WebEx from Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO, +0.15% \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to poach. By locking down more big-money deals, expanding offerings beyond videoconferencing and increasing the base of smaller corporate clients, Zoom continues to prove it is built to be a force even after the pandemic has run its course. Yuan predicted that even though everyone will be working from home for the foreseeable future, the nature of work when people return to the office is going to change dramatically in ways that will still make Zoom an important part of the daily routine. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you look at a lot of companies they have a very big [open] space, I think that may not work anymore in the future,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. He also said that employees may shift to two or three days a week in the office, working at home the other days, and there won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be much need for a lot of small offices with few workers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very, very likely it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hybrid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Indeed, as the future of work is likely to be more of the same that many are experiencing now, Zoom is poised to continue to reap the benefits."}]}
