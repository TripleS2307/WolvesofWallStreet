The investment bank raised its 12-month forecast on gold to $2,000 an ounce, from $1,800. It also lifted its three-month view to $1,800 from $1,600 and its six-month forecast to $1,900 from $1,650. \u201cGold investment demand tends to grow into the early stage of the economic recovery, driven by continued debasement concerns and lower real rates,\u201d wrote analysts at Goldman Sachs. \u201cSimultaneously, we see a material comeback from [emerging market] consumer demand boosted by easing of lockdowns and a weaker dollar.\u201d The analysts estimated that \u201cfear\u201d driven investment demand lifted gold by 18% this year, but the negative shock to \u201cwealth\u201d produced an 8% \u201cdrag.\u201d They pegged the net effect at 10%, which coincides with gold\u2019s year to date rise of 13%. The most-active August gold contract US:GCQ20 settled at $1,753 an ounce, up $21.90, or 1.3%, on Friday and was nearly 14% higher for the year so far. The Goldman analysts expect strength in development market investment demand to \u201cpersist even as economies recover, supported by fears of debasement and the higher level of economic uncertainty of the crisis.\u201d Still, for gold prices to go materially above $2,000, inflation will need to move above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target and this move would need to be met with a muted policy response, they said. The analysts also raised their 12-month silver forecast by nearly 47% to $22 an ounce, from a previous forecast of $15. They said \u201ccoordinated global stimulus\u201d will help generate global industrial production growth and economic activity. \u201cAs the economy recover and \u2018fear\u2019 based demand for gold moderates, we expect silver industrial demand to increase, giving up prices,\u201d they said. In Friday dealings, July silver US:SIN20 rose 34 cents, or 1.9%, to $17.847 an ounce, though the contract was still down by more than 1% for the year so far."}]}
