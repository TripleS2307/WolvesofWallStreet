Through its lending facilities, the Fed is buying individual corporate bonds from the market in amounts in line with an index of its own construction, which would eventually see the central bank snap up a large cross-section of U.S. investment-grade and some sub-investment-grade debt. Bonds from these companies were the 10 biggest beneficiaries as of June 17. Issuer Purchase amount ($) AT&T 16,476,295.05 UnitedHealth Group 16,451,866.25 Comcast 13,315,346.67 Anthem 12,937,095.56 Walmart 8,758,531.52 Constellation Brands 8,465,435.00 Ford 8,051,573.33 CVS Health 7,762,008.33 Boeing 7,648,612.66 AbbVie 7,394,459.72 It\u2019s early days, so the Fed\u2019s biggest purchases don\u2019t line up neatly with the biggest constituents of the bond-market index. The six biggest constituents of the Fed\u2019s new debt index are Toyota, Volkswagen, Daimler, AT&T, Apple and Verizon Communications, yet only AT&T T, -1.01% made the top 10 list of purchases. These differences are expected to be ironed out over time as the central bank snaps up more debt. The Fed has purchased 119 bond issues in the two days of trading as of June 17, even as the index is made up of 794 issuers. The discrepancy between the Fed\u2019s purchases and the index underpinning the central bank\u2019s bond buying is also reflected in how the share of credit ratings of the bonds purchased differ with the proportion of ratings reflected by the Fed\u2019s debt benchmark. For example, around 54.8% of the bonds included in the Fed\u2019s broad market index carry a credit rating of triple-B, the biggest but lowest letter rating in the investment-grade bond market. But 48.3% of the bonds bought through the Fed\u2019s secondary credit facility, however, sport a rating of triple-B. For the week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% lost 3.3%, the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% notched a 2.9% decline, and the Nasdaq COMP, +1.39% fell 1.9% for the period."}]}
