China's producer price index dropped 2.4% in July from a year earlier, narrowing from a 3.0% decline in June, the National Bureau of Statistics said Monday. A poll of economists by The Wall Street Journal had predicted the gauge of industrial prices would drop 2.6%. China's consumer price index in July picked up 2.7% from a year earlier, compared with June's 2.5% rise, as recent pork price increases and floods in southern China drove up food prices. The economists' poll had forecast inflation at 2.7%. Demand for pork has been rising as the catering industry recovers, said Dong Lijuan, a senior statistician at the NBS in a separate statement. She added that floods in many parts of the country, which disrupted transportation, had curtailed pork supply. Food prices rose 13.2% last month, up from a 11.1% increase in June. Non-food prices stay flat compared with a year ago, after June's 0.3% increase. China's pork-price inflation accelerated slightly in July. Pork prices rose 85.7% compared with the same period a year earlier, up from a 81.6% increase in June. Pork prices boosted headline CPI by about 2.32 percentage points."}]}
