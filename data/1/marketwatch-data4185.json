Investors have been struggling to balance the reality of the rise in the daily rate of new coronavirus cases against a marginal improvement in economic data and a rollback of red tape by U.S. financial regulators. How are the benchmarks performing? The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% advanced 299.66 points, 1.2%, to close at 25,745.60, in turbulent trading, while the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% closed 33.43 points, or 1.1%, higher at 3,083,76. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.39% was 107.84 points, or 1.1%, at 10,017. What\u2019s driving the market? The stock market struggled to find its footing Thursday, after the biggest sell off in two weeks on Wednesday, but ultimately gained ground in the final half-hour of trade helped by financial sector stocks which have lagged in the rebound from the market lows seen in late March. Combined with a late-session resurgence in technology names, ten of the S&P 500\u2019s 11 sectors finished higher, with the exception of the utility sector, which closed down 1.2%.

They will also be able avoid setting aside cash for derivatives trades between different affiliates of the same firm, potentially freeing up billions of dollars in capital for the industry, according to the Wall Street Journal. Shares of major banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM, -0.57%, Citigroup C, +0.47% Goldman Sachs GS, -0.21% and Morgan Stanley MS, -0.34%, all finished sharply higher after the reports. The regulator update came ahead of the results of the Federal Reserve\u2019s annual \u201cstress test\u201d of the banking system is expected to be released after Thursday\u2019s close. The Federal Reserve earlier said banks entered the coronavirus crisis in a strong position, but analysts believe that the length of the pandemic could erode the balance sheets of some institutions as credit losses mount. The Fed will release the results of its bank stress tests later Thursday but has asked banks to refrain from disclosing the results publicly until after the market closes on June 29.

It always comes back to that, and the psyche out there is very much concerned about it.\u201d In an interview Thursday, O\u2019Keefe told MarketWatch, \u201cI do think the market got ahead of itself, for sure.\u201d In particular, O\u2019Keefe says he\u2019s watching \u201csome of the growthy names like Amazon AMZN, +3.01% and Facebook FB, +0.26%, \u201d that may be attracting some bubblelike speculation on the belief that they are pandemic-proof.
