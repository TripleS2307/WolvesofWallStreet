Lululemon said it earned $29 million, or 22 cents a share, in the quarter, compared with $97 million, or 74 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Sales fell 17% to $652 million, as a surge in online sales was not enough to make up for store closures due to the coronavirus pandemic. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected earnings of 20 cents a share on sales of $692 million. Lululemon said that it ended the quarter with $823 million in cash and equivalents, and a borrowing capacity of $398 million. Online sales were a highlight of the quarter, up 68% and making up half of the company's total sales in the three-month period. \"Our strong digital business demonstrates the strength of our guest connection,\" Chief Executive Calvin McDonald said in a statement. Lululemon didn't provide fiscal 2020 guidance thanks to \"rapid and continuous developments\" related to the pandemic's impact on its business, it said. It also did not provide same-store sales figures, saying they wouldn't represent true business trends due to the closures. Shares of Lululemon had ended the regular trading day down 4.7%."}]}
