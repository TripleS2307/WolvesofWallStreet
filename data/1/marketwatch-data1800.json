The former vice president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments appeared to be a thinly veiled criticism of President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stance on mask wearing and the commander-in-chief\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expressed reluctance in donning personal protective equipment amid the worst public health crisis in a more than a century.

Asked about Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s view on masks, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said it was the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s choice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe encourages people to make whatever decision is best for their safety, but he did say to me he has no problem with masks and to do whatever your local jurisdiction requests of you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she told reporters on Monday. In his comments, Biden said that a state-by-state approach to public health policy hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worked to sufficiently tamp down the outbreak thus far.
