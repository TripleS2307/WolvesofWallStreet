The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has committed more than $500 million to fight the coronavirus pandemic. Twitter TWTR, -0.23% CEO Jack Dorsey pledged $1 billion for coronavirus relief and later added racial justice organizations to his list of beneficiaries. MacKenzie Scott, ex-wife of Amazon AMZN, +3.01% CEO Jeff Bezos, has handed out $1.7 billion to address the pandemic, racial justice and other issues. The moment has also brought new momentum to a less popular style of philanthropy: Spend-down, or time-limited, philanthropy, in which charitable foundations spend their assets by a certain date, then close up shop. This is in contrast to a traditional foundation, in which a wealthy person puts money aside to address an issue of their choosing, such as cancer research or animal cruelty. These foundations are typically designed to last forever, and they tend to hand out money relatively slowly. In fact, they\u2019re required to give out only 5% of their assets each year in grants to nonprofits. The spend-down approach has its critics, and the debate goes to the heart of some thorny questions: What is the best way to use money to solve society\u2019s problems? Who benefits when a foundation exists in perpetuity? Meanwhile, growing wealth inequality and ever-louder critiques of philanthropy have added to a sense that it\u2019s time to rethink how to spend money for the greater good. Also see: He went from multibillionaire to relatively broke and living in a small apartment \u2014 just as he planned Foundations and funders that are tackling \u201cmassive, wicked problems\u201d like climate change, social justice and racial inequity have also come to realize that these issues \u201cwon\u2019t be solved by allocations of 5% every year,\u201d said Melissa Stevens, executive director of the Milken Institute Center for Strategic Philanthropy. \u201cThere\u2019s no longer really this choice of, \u2018Go big or go home.\u2019 It\u2019s rather an imperative to go big and be part of a better solution.\u201d Why spend-down philanthropy is becoming more popular now Spend-down philanthropy is not new, but it is still outside the norm. About 70% of foundations are designed to exist in perpetuity, and about 30% have put deadlines on their spending, according to a January 2020 report by Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors and Campden Wealth. The number of foundations pursuing a time-limited strategy has increased by nearly two-thirds since 2000. \u201cThe interest in time-limited philanthropy has been growing pretty steadily over the last 20 years, and the current crises seem to be accelerating that,\u201d said Melissa A. Berman, president and CEO of Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors. \u201c \u201cThere\u2019s no longer really this choice of, \u2018Go big or go home.\u2019 It\u2019s rather an imperative to go big and be part of a better solution.\u201d \u201d \u2014 Melissa Stevens, executive director of the Milken Institute Center for Strategic Philanthropy The heads of three spend-down foundations recently urged others to follow their lead, writing in July in the Chronicle of Philanthropy: \u201cThere is no better time than now for philanthropy to spend itself out of existence.\u201d Rather than fully embrace a spend-down model, some foundations are increasing their payout rate this year. The Wallace Global Fund, for example, said it would spend 20% of its assets on coronavirus relief. This year, the Atlantic Philanthropies, probably the best-known spend-down foundation, closed its doors \u2014 as it had planned to \u2014 after donating $8 billion over 38 years. Founder Chuck Feeney, who made his fortune as co-founder of Duty Free Shoppers, signed off with a message: \u201cTo those wondering about Giving While Living: Try it, you\u2019ll like it.\u201d Others appear to be following his lead. Every decade or so since the 1990s there have been predictions of a new wave of spend-down foundations on the horizon that have not materialized, said Ben Soskis, a research associate in the Center on Nonprofits and Philanthropy at the Urban Institute who studies the history of philanthropy. But this moment feels different, Soskis says, in part because today\u2019s billionaire philanthropists are making their money as young people. Gilded Age philanthropists such as Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller were in their 70s when they started their private foundations, both of which still exist today. Facebook FB, +0.26% CEO Mark Zuckerberg, for example, was 31 when he and his wife, Priscilla Chan, announced both the birth of their first child and their intention to give away 99% of their Facebook shares while they were still alive. \u201c \u201cWhen you start to make your wealth earlier in life and you take on a responsibility as a philanthropist as a vocation early in life, the idea of perpetuity itself loses its luster.\u201d \u201d \u2014 Ben Soskis, research associate in the Center on Nonprofits and Philanthropy at the Urban Institute \u201cWhen you start to make your wealth earlier in life and you take on a responsibility as a philanthropist as a vocation early in life, the idea of perpetuity itself loses its luster, because you have five decades as a philanthropist in front of you,\u201d Soskis said. Philanthropists are also becoming more comfortable throwing money at certain problems because it\u2019s now easier to measure the impact they\u2019re having, Berman said. \u201cPeople are more and more confident that they can have impact by giving at a much faster rate,\u201d she said. Organizations such as the nonprofit GiveDirectly have shown through randomized controlled trials that giving money directly to poor households with no conditions has immediate and lasting benefits, she said. Motivations behind spend-down philanthropy Motivations behind spend-down philanthropy have varied over the years, and sometimes reflect broader societal trends. Industrialist John M. Olin, for example, put his foundation\u2019s spending on the fast track because he feared future generations wouldn\u2019t carry out his conservative vision. He was \u201ctroubled by a growing anti-business atmosphere among college students and their professors on many campuses in the late 1960s.\u201d \u201c \u201cThe risk you\u2019re running is that the timeline of your giving doesn\u2019t match the timeline by which change can happen in the issue that you\u2019re tackling .\u201d \u201d \u2014 Melissa A. Berman, president and CEO of Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors He was also influenced by Henry Ford II\u2019s 1977 resignation from the board of the Ford Foundation, reportedly over frustration that its grantmaking had strayed to the left politically and \u201creflected little interest in or understanding of the system of private enterprise that had generated the foundation\u2019s wealth.\u201d (Ford, for instance, questioned the foundation\u2019s funding of the arts.) Olin\u2019s philanthropy went on to help create an influential network of think tanks and academic programs that helped shape the conservative movement. Today, some spend-down philanthropists are motivated by an urgency around the world\u2019s most pressing problems. \u201cThere is a sense around certain issues, particularly climate change, that there is a tipping point and that putting a lot of resources over a short period of time to keep the crisis from becoming uncontrollable is better than releasing money over a long slow period of time,\u201d Berman said. Pros and cons of spend-down philanthropy Sometimes making big bets gets big results. Philanthropist Irene Diamond, for example, spent down her and her husband\u2019s foundation of more than $200 million over 10 years in the 1980s and \u201990s and funded the development of the AIDS \u201ccocktail,\u201d a major breakthrough in AIDS treatment. But other problems are more incalcitrant, Berman noted. \u201cThe risk you\u2019re running is that the timeline of your giving doesn\u2019t match the timeline by which change can happen in the issue that you\u2019re tackling,\u201d she said. Funding the creation of a vaccine for COVID-19, for example, could happen on a relatively short timeline. Philanthropists have poured money into that effort, including the Gates Foundation, which is funding research into potential treatments and the manufacture and delivery of vaccine doses in India and other low-income countries. The Gates Foundation is a spend-down foundation, but its timeline isn\u2019t as tight as Irene Diamond\u2019s was. The Gates Foundation plans to spend all of its resources within 20 years after the deaths of Bill and Melinda Gates. Warren Buffett, who pledged most of his fortune to the Gates Foundation, \u201chas stipulated that the proceeds from the Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A, +0.06% shares he still owns upon his death are to be used for philanthropic purposes within 10 years after his estate has been settled.\u201d Jack Dorsey and MacKenzie Scott haven\u2019t publicly announced an intention to be spend-down philanthropists, but Scott has signed the Giving Pledge, a promise to give away at least half of her wealth either during her lifetime or in her will. She and Dorsey, who is one of the top funders of COVID-19 efforts, have won praise for the fast rate of their giving and their transparent approach. Dorsey publicly lists his grants on a Google GOOGL, +1.82% spreadsheet, for example. People who support perpetuity for foundations say it will take a long time to end problems like poverty, racism and bias against girls and women, Berman said, and contend that doing so will require a slow stream of funding over many years. \u201cThere is clear value both in acting with urgency and dealing with pain and suffering in the current moment, but there is also benefit in thinking about what is the generational long-term change,\u201d she said."}]}
