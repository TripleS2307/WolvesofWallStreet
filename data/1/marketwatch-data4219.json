The slight improvement from 1.19 million jobless claims at the end of July is somewhat of a bearish development for haven seekers. New applications for unemployment benefits, a rough gauge of layoffs, declined to 963,000, the Labor Department said Thursday. It was the second straight large decline and the first below one million in more than 20 weeks. Gold futures fell briefly below $1,930 an ounce immediately after the jobless claims data, then saw a bumpy ride higher. \u201c \u2018A pullback this week is not unexpected and even hoped for by some as profit taking, price retracement and consolidation potentially set the stage for further upside.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Will Cai, Wilshire Phoenix Funds \u201cIn these uncertain times, we expect gold prices to be volatile,\u201d said Will Cai, partner and head of Wilshire Phoenix Funds. \u201cA pullback this week is not unexpected and even hoped for by some as profit taking, price retracement and consolidation potentially set the stage for further upside,\u201d he told MarketWatch. December gold GCZ20, +2.17% GC00, +2.17% climbed $21.40, or 1.1%, to settle at $1,970.40 an ounce, after tapping an intraday low of $1,923. Prices for the contract remained lower for the week, down more than 3% from last Friday\u2019s settlement, according to FactSet data. Despite the reduction in jobless claims, some experts say that gold has managed to hold its ground because claims still remain elevated from the pre-pandemic levels. \u201cThe reason that we have not seen any substantial selloff in the gold price is because this U.S. initial jobless claims are still very high as compared to normal number,\u201d wrote Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at AvaTrade in a daily note. \u201cThe initial jobless claims number was much better than the market anticipation and this has pushed the equity futures higher,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe fact is that the U.S. economy has become more resilient to pandemic and it is trying its best to find its way out,\u201d he said. For now, Cai thinks investors should \u201clook to gold not as a short term bet, but a long term portfolio hedge and diversifier.\u201d Meanwhile, silver prices Thursday outperformed gold, with September silver US:SIU20 tacking on $1.74, or 6.7%, to end at $27.718 an ounce, after retreating 0.3% a day ago. The day\u2019s percentage rise was the largest since July 27, according to FactSet data. September copper US:HGU20 fell by 2.9% to $2.807 a pound. October platinum PLV20, +3.99% rose 2.5% to $983 an ounce and September palladium US:PAU20 settled at $2,216.80 an ounce, up 2.2%."}]}
