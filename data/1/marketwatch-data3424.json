Kevin and Susan Bryant, 55 and 48, spent most of their lives in Texas, recently in the retiree hot spot Austin. But \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen Austin became a mini\u00e2\u0080\u0093Silicon Valley, we were priced out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kevin, a now-retired history teacher and principal, tells MarketWatch. The history buff says he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d always wanted to live in Europe \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u009cin a castle, specifically, but I let that part go,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he jokes \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and began hunting for where the couple might retire on his educator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pension. They considered more than a dozen countries, finally settling on Spain for a variety of reasons, including its relative affordability, its good health care and that his teacher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pension could qualify as income to help him get residency there. \u201c Need help finding a place to retire? Contact the MarketWatch Retirement team at HelpMeRetire@marketwatch.com and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you with your search. \u201d To find the right spot, they toured Spain, rejecting Barcelona because it was too big; Tarragona because it was too far north (they wanted somewhere a little warmer); and Pe\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00adscola, because, though they liked it, Susan jokes, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI could never tell my mother I lived in a town with that name.\u00e2\u0080\u009d D\u00c3\u00a9nia, Spain iStock They found D\u00c3\u00a9nia, a coastal town where they now live, by accident: \u00e2\u0080\u009cLooking at the map one morning, I noticed that a ferry from Ibiza docks at a place called D\u00c3\u00a9nia. I immediately thought that very interesting people go to Ibiza, and many must go by that route, so we should check out this place,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kevin, who has one grown child, explains. They loved D\u00c3\u00a9nia for a number of reasons, including its historic architecture (there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even an ancient Moorish castle for Kevin, if only as a visitor), great food (Unesco named it a Creative City of Gastronomy), four-season climate and coastal location. Plus, Susan adds: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very family-oriented city with lots of celebrations.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They moved to D\u00c3\u00a9nia in 2016, as chronicled on Facebook. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what their lives are like now, from costs, to health care to residency and downsides. The cost: The Bryants say they live on Kevin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pension, and say they \u00e2\u0080\u009clive very well on $2,000 per month.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They spend about $665 on rent (they live in a two-bedroom apartment near the beach with a shared pool), $82 on electricity, $33 on water, $33 on internet, $44 on phone, $90 on a gym membership, $130 on health insurance and $490 on food each month, they tell MarketWatch. The Bryants. Kevin and Susan Bryant The Bryants save money by not owning a car. They live on a bus line and say they spend about $30 a month taking the bus to and from town. (They note that a taxi home from a dinner out might cost them $12.) \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098Health care is the thing that will keep us from going back to the U.S. We can afford to grow old gracefully and see doctors here. It will not break us.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Kevin Bryant They spend most of their extra money on travel, having recently hit up the Greek Isles and enjoyed many shorter trips through Spain. They point out that travel within Europe often isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that pricey because flights are short and low-cost via regional carriers. And mostly they take bus trips to nearby towns including Valencia (about a $13 fare) and Benidorm ($5). Health care: The Bryants say they spend roughly $130 for both of them for private health insurance each month \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been very pleased with the quality of their care. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI go to the freaking doctor here. I grew up male in Texas \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go to the doctor unless something is dangling off or broken,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he jokes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAny time we need something now we go to see the doctor, we get [an appointment] in a day or two,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he adds, noting that \u00e2\u0080\u009cour doctor is Dutch and speaks five languages \u00e2\u0080\u0094 cool guy, too.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Some expats may be able to qualify for the free state health-care system in Spain (here are the guidelines); expats who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t qualify for that \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or who want to forgo the sometimes long waits that come with the public system \u00e2\u0080\u0094 can buy private insurance to cover themselves. (You can read about the different health-care systems here). He credits his great relationship with the doctor, and excellent experience with the Spanish health system, with catching the cancer spots on his face and head early and offering a treatment that cost less than $100. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I was still in the U.S., the cancer spots would still be growing because I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know it was there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says. Kevin and Susan Bryant. Spain is recognized for quality health care: A study published in The Lancet on quality and access to health care places Spain among the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top 20 countries, above the United States, which was ranked 29th. The Bryants are so pleased with the low cost and quality of health care in Spain that they say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a major reason they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never leave. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHealth care is the thing that will keep us from going back to the U.S. We can afford to grow old gracefully and see doctors here. It will not break us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He adds: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs things stand, and as I see them standing into the future, health-care costs in the U.S. completely preclude our ever returning to live there. It would be wonderful to have the option, but we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Residency: The process of getting visas to move to \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and now stay in \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the country hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been smooth at all. When they initially went to the Spanish consulate in Houston in the hopes of moving, they came armed with all the paperwork they were told on the website that they needed \u00e2\u0080\u0094 only to be informed that those papers weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enough. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople from Spain were in there and heard the whole thing. I asked them, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Is this the way it always is?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And they all started laughing and saying yes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kevin recalls. It took them three trips to the consulate to get their visas. Now they must get their visas renewed to stay in Spain, and Kevin says it has been \u00e2\u0080\u009ca real hassle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d adding: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe eventually had to hire a lawyer, and our case is in progress. Given another chance, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d hire the lawyer straight off and let them do all the work.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Here is an overview on visas for residing in Spain. People eating and drinking at Els Magazinos market in D\u00c3\u00a9nia. iStock The cons: The hardest thing for both Kevin and Susan has been missing their family stateside. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter that, lack of instant taste gratification. In a major U.S. city, almost any food craving can be satisfied at any time of day or night,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kevin says, adding that there is an upside to the lack of options in D\u00c3\u00a9nia, though: It has \u00e2\u0080\u009cmade me a much better cook as I attempt to replicate some tastes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But he jokes: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have failed to replicate one of my favorite dishes, cheese enchiladas in chile gravy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Plus, the language has been \u00e2\u0080\u009can amusing challenge\u00e2\u0080\u009d for the Bryants. Kevin studied Spanish in school and \u00e2\u0080\u009ceven remembered some of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI expected to be fluent fairly quickly, but we moved to a place where many speak Valencian rather than Castilian, so my progress is slower than expected.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Susan didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any Spanish-language background, but she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s taking classes and now says that, while she can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t converse that well, she can understand and read things better. Bottom line: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot more laid back here. People look out for one another,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Susan says. But, she adds, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI love America and always will.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}]}
