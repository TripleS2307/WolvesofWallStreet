On Sept. 30, a coalition of trade union leaders representing over 12 million workers called on the European Commission to investigate Amazon\u2019s activities, including allegations that it surveilled its own employees. Previous reports, including a Guardian investigation from last year, have alleged that Amazon employees claim they have been subjected to poor working conditions and have been punished for getting injured on the job."}]}
