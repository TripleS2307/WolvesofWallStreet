What\u2019s driving Treasurys? U.S. economic data helped to ease demand for government paper later, erasing an earlier overnight rally.

The Markit purchasing managers\u2019 indexes for the U.S. services sector for August rose to a one and a half year high of 54.7 this month from 50.3 in July. In Europe, the overall eurozone composite PMI fell to a two-month low of 51.6 in August from 54.9 in July.
