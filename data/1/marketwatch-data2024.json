The Judicial Council of California had been given temporary authority over the issue during the COVID-19 crisis, but \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe judicial branch cannot usurp the responsibility of the other two branches on a long-term basis to deal with the myriad impacts of the pandemic,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Chief Justice Tani G. Cantil-Sakauye in a statement Thursday. She urged Gov. Gavin Newsom and state lawmakers to act quickly to \u00e2\u0080\u009cresolve this looming crisis.\u00e2\u0080\u009d One proposal that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s making its way through the Legislature, Assembly Bill 1436, seeks to ban evictions of tenants during the pandemic while providing mortgage forbearance to landlords. In Silicon Valley, more than 43,000 households could face eviction, Working Partnerships USA and Law Foundation of Silicon Valley estimate. In Los Angeles, UCLA researchers have said that number could be more than 365,000. Nationwide, housing researchers estimate that 30 million to 40 million people could be kicked out of their homes."}]}
