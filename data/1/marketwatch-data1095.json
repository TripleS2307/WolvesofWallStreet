The estimates by the experts are it\u2019ll save over 40,000 lives in the next three months.\u201d The former vice president in June had said the \u201cvery top\u201d of government should call for mask wearing, in a criticism of Trump\u2019s reluctance in donning personal protective equipment during the coronavirus crisis. But Biden took the matter a step further on Thursday, describing his proposal as a \u201csimple proposition\u201d that \u201cdoesn\u2019t have anything to do with Democrats, Republicans or independents.\u201d Related:Trump has change of heart on face masks: \u2018If you\u2019re close together, I would put on the mask\u2019 And see:This is the biggest mistake people make while wearing a face mask \u201cIt\u2019s not about your rights. It\u2019s about your responsibilities as an American,\u201d Biden also said, as he appeared with his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris of California. \u201cJoe Biden is about leadership in our country,\u201d she said."}]}
