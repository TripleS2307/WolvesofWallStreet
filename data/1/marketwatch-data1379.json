Priced \u00e2\u0080\u009caround $40,000\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to Nissan \u00e2\u0080\u009cHands-off\u00e2\u0080\u009d automated driving in some circumstances You might remember the IMx, the concept car that\u00c2 Nissan NSANY, -1.50% \u00c2 \u00c2 showed off\u00c2 back in 2017. At this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2 Tokyo Auto Show, Nissan introduced the all-new Nissan Ariya Concept, then followed that up with the production version in July of 2020.\u00c2 The Nissan Ariya is an\u00c2 electric crossover SUV\u00c2 that kicks off the next chapter in Nissan vehicles. The company even has a new logo. If Nissan can bring the Ariya to the market in a timely fashion, it could seriously compete with the\u00c2 \u00c2 Tesla TSLA, +1.89% \u00c2 \u00c2 Model Y,\u00c2 Toyota TM, -0.65% \u00c2 RAV4 Prime, and\u00c2 Ford\u00e2\u0080\u0099s F, -1.36% \u00c2 \u00c2 Mustang-inspired electric crossover. How fast, how far, how much? The Ariya will be available for sale as early as the fall of 2021. Nissan says the range of 300 miles is a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpreliminary Nissan estimate for the long-range 2WD model.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of a loaded statement because it tells us that there will be an all-wheel-drive version, which Nissan has confirmed. It also tells us that there will be varying models with different ranges, likely, costing more or less depending on how far you want to go on a single charge. That \u00e2\u0080\u009caround $40,000 price\u00e2\u0080\u009d will probably be for the base model. Based on Nissan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reinvention of itself, that base model will probably include some premium features with the option to add more. The 0-to-60 mph time should be under 5 seconds. Check out: A first look at Toyota\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new RAV4 plug-in hybridHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we know We know the physical dimensions of the Ariya \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the crossover will be pretty similar to the\u00c2 Nissan Rogue\u00c2 compact crossover, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be wider and lower to the ground, which gives it a decidedly more athletic stance. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a 2-row, 5-passenger crossover. Buyers will have the choice of front-wheel drive or \u00e2\u0080\u009ce-4FORCE\u00e2\u0080\u009d all-wheel drive. Nissan describes e-4FORCE like this: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe e-4FORCE balances the powerful performance with a smooth, comfortable ride and all-weather capability. The system\u00e2\u0080\u0099s twin electric motors provide balanced, assured handling with sports car-level power.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Over-the-air firmware, Amazon AMZN, +3.01% \u00c2 Alexa, Android Auto, and Apple AAPL, +1.74% \u00c2 Car Play are all on board as are Nissan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s excellent Zero-Gravity seats. Nissan says the Ariya is the beginning of a new look for the brand. The exterior is interesting and the front plays off of the V-Motion grille shared by most Nissan models, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re more interested in the interior. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very minimalist \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the 12.3-in screen has just one physical knob, and the rest of the controls appear to be via either touchscreen or haptic feedback. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a prominent digital driver information display rather than a traditional gauge cluster. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a sleek and clean look that we hope to see in future production Nissans.Safety In addition to the next generation ProPilot Assist 2.0, the Ariya gets a bunch of standard safety equipment. Nissan Safety Shield 360 is standard and that includes automatic emergency braking, forward collision warning, rear automatic braking, lane-departure warning, blind-spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, high-beam assist, and Nissan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s around-view monitor. Also see: The 10 best new car models of 2020 Nissan is also promising ProPilot 2.0, the next step in Nissan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s semiautonomous driver assistance technology suite, on the production-model Ariya. The suite will include hands-free highway driving, similar to what you can find with the\u00c2 Cadillac Super Cruise\u00c2 system. No production Nissan available in the U.S. is equipped with ProPilot 2.0 yet, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible that the Ariya will introduce that tech to American buyers.The Leaf needs a friend The\u00c2 Nissan Leaf\u00c2 was one of the first all-electric cars from a mainstream automaker. That was 10 years ago. When the Ariya hits the market, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be nice to see the Leaf finally get an SUV counterpart that hopefully delivers similarly strong value.\u00c2 Also see: These 3 EVs are the lowest cost to own over 5 years See the specs here.
