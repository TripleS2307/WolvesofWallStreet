As asymptomatic carriers are a key reason for the spread of the virus, the news was widely criticized on social media and elsewhere. \u201cYou do not necessarily need a test unless you are a vulnerable individual or your health-care provider or state or local public health officials recommend you take one,\u201d the CDC said. That marks a change from previous guidance that people who had spent more than 15 minutes with an individual who had tested positive for the virus should also get tested, regardless of the presentation of symptoms. The U.S. has conducted more than 73 million tests this year, and about 6 million of them have come back positive, according to the COVID Tracking Project. Coming just days after the head of the Food and Drug Administration, Stephen Hahn, was forced to acknowledge that a comment he made Sunday about the use of convalescent plasma as a treatment for hospitalized COVID-19 patients was inaccurate, the news is a second blow this week to the credibility of a leading U.S. public health agency. \u201cOur work on the \u2018silent\u2019 spread underscores the importance of testing people who have been exposed to COVID-19 regardless of symptoms,\u201d Alison Galvani, an epidemiologist and director of the Center for Infectious Disease Modeling and Analysis, tweeted. \u201cThis change in policy will kill.\u201d New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the move was political, \u201cnot science.\u201d iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } It is estimated that up to 40% of people who have COVID-19 are asymptomatic, meaning they do not demonstrate common symptoms of an infection like coughing or muscle aches, according to one research letter published in May in JAMA Network. The news also comes after the U.S. counted 38,200 new cases on Tuesday, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, up a few hundred from Monday though better than last week when cases were above 40,000 most days. In all, 5.79 million people in the U.S. have been infected, or roughly a quarter of the global total, according to the Johns Hopkins data. There have been more than 179,000 deaths in the U.S., by far the highest in the world. On a per capita basis, the U.S. currently ranks fifth in the world with 54.55 deaths per 100,000 people, after Peru, Spain, Chile and Brazil. Rural Illinois is emerging as something of a hot spot with cases up 14% from the average of two weeks ago, according to a New York Times tracker. Illinois counted 1,756 new cases on Tuesday and 32 new deaths. The state has had at least 225,812 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 8,155 deaths since the start of the outbreak. In other news: \u2022 The Trump administration has threatened to cut Medicare and Medicaid funding to hospitals if they do not report COVID-19 patient data and rest results to the Department of Health and Human Services, the Associated Press reported. The threat was included in new emergency rules announced by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The program has been voluntary until now. The new rules also apply to nursing homes. The American Hospital Association called the new rules a \u201cheavy-handed regulatory approach\u201d and complained that it was not consulted. \u201cThis disturbing move, announced in final form without consultation, or the opportunity to provide feedback through appropriate administrative procedures prior to it becoming effective, could jeopardize access to care and leave patients and communities without vital health services from their local hospital during a pandemic,\u201d Rick Pollack, president and CEO of the association, said in a statement. The rule \u201cshould be reversed immediately,\u201d he said.

BIIB, -0.13% in February led to about 20,000 cases in four counties in Massachusetts by early May, way more than the 99 previously identified, the Boston Globe reported, citing three scientists involved in a new study. The study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, was backed by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the CDC and private donors including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. \u201cOur results highlight the failure of measures to prevent importation into [Massachusetts] early in the outbreak, underscore the role of superspreading in amplifying an outbreak in a major urban area, and lay a foundation for contact tracing informed by genetic data,\u201d the authors wrote. \u2022 There are growing concern that Lebanon could lose control of the virus, after a spike in cases following the massive explosion in capital Beirut on Aug. 4, the Guardian reported. The country\u2019s interim prime minister, Hassan Diab, said the number of new infections is climbing fast, \u201cand if this continues, we will lose control of this epidemic,\u201d he said, according to a statement issued by the supreme defense council. Lebanon counted 525 new cases on Tuesday and 12 deaths, the paper said. Cases doubled in the two weeks after the explosion, which left many people homeless and damaged hospitals. \u2022 Germany recorded 1,576 new cases of COVID-19 on Tuesday, up from 1,278 on Monday, according to Der Spiegel, citing data from the Robert Koch Institute. That comes after more than 2,000 cases were reported on Saturday, the first time Germany has exceeded that number in a single day since late April. \u2022 U.S. universities are still seeing rising numbers of new cases as students return to dorm rooms and college bars, even though many have not yet returned to classes. At least seven universities, mostly in the South, have counted at least 500 cases, according to a New York Times survey, while another 30 have at least 200 confirmed cases. In all, there have been 26,000 confirmed cases at 750 colleges, the survey found. College Town Economies Brace for Covid Blow Latest tallies The global tally for confirmed cases of COVID-19 edged closer to 24 million on Wednesday, with the death toll rising to 819,945, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. At least 15.6 million people are confirmed to have recovered. Brazil is second to the U.S. with 3.7 million cases and 116,580 deaths.

China, where the illness was first reported late last year, has 89,752 cases, and 4,712 fatalities.What\u2019s the economy saying? Orders for durable goods lasting at least three years surged 11.2% in July, largely because of strong consumer demand for new cars and trucks, but business spending outside the automobile industry was softer, and investment grew more slowly, MarketWatch\u2019s Jeffry Bartash reported. The increase in orders last month \u2014 the third in a row \u2014 easily topped the 4.8% forecast of economists surveyed by MarketWatch. Demand for industrial goods was less robust if automobiles and airplanes are excluded. New orders rose a smaller 2.4% minus transportation.

Bookings in July were actually higher last month compared with July 2019. Orders are likely to moderate soon now that plants have reopened and automobile manufacturers are operating closer to normal capacity. Sales to corporate customers are still depressed, and demand usually wanes in the fall. Airline orders only declined half as much in July as they did in June, the government said, reflecting fewer cancellations. That also contributed to the better-than-expected increase in industrial orders last month. A key measure of business investment, known as core orders, edged up 1.9% last month and has returned close to pre-crisis levels. These exclude defense and transportation orders. Business investment was already weak before the pandemic, however, and is unlikely to regain full strength until the virus is brought under control at home and abroad. The disease has wreaked havoc on the global trading system and forced businesses to preserve cash in case the economy worsens. \u201cU.S. durable-goods orders made more progress toward recovering in July despite the resurgence in the virus,\u201d said economist Katherine Judge of CIBC Economics, but \u201cwe continue to see the recovery in business investment from here as occurring relatively slowly given the prevalence of spare capacity.\u201d See now: MarketWatch Coronavirus Recovery TrackerWhat are companies saying? \u2022 Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.\u2019s BBBY, -1.37% planned reorganization to focus on online sales will result in 2,800 job cuts from corporate headquarters and retail stores, effective immediately.

Through the first three weeks of the third quarter, same-store sales increased 11%. \u2022 Nordstrom Inc. JWN, -2.18% reported second-quarter sales that missed Wall Street expectations as losses have widened during the pandemic.

URBN, +0.53% swung to a surprise second-quarter profit, and sales beat Wall Street expectations thanks to online sales.
