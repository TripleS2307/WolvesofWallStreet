Fort Wayne, Indiana-based Vera Bradley said it had net income of $7.2 million, or 42 cents a share, in the quarter, up from income of $5.9 million, or 17 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. The number includes $3.8 million in after-tax charges, $1.1 million for a change in its income tax estimate, and a change in the numerator of the earnings per share calculation due to an accounting adjustment. It also includes income from Pura Vida, which the company acquired last year. Adjusted per-share earnings came to 32 cents, well ahead of the FactSet consensus for a loss per share of 7 cents. Revenue rose 10% to $131.8 million, including Pura Vida. Without that revenue, Vera Bradley had revenue of $99 million. The FactSet consensus was for revenue of $100 million. E-commerce sales doubled and partially offset a decline in store revenue as COVID-19 shuttered stores for part of the quarter. \"We significantly expanded our consolidated gross margin rate in the quarter through sales of cotton masks, product collaborations, careful inventory management, and tightly controlled promotional activity,\" Chief Executive Rob Wallstrom said in a statement. The company is not providing guidance, due to the uncertainty created by the pandemic. Shares have fallen 54% in the year through Tuesday, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% has gained 9%."}]}
