Trump said the following in a tweet on Thursday morning: \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098Bob Woodward had my quotes for many months. If he thought they were so bad or dangerous, why didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t he immediately report them in an effort to save lives? Didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t he have an obligation to do so? No, because he knew they were good and proper answers. Calm, no panic!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 President Donald Trump Woodward, for his part, told the Associated Press on Wednesday that he needed time to be sure that Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s private comments from a half-year ago were accurate. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe tells me this, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m thinking, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Wow, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interesting, but is it true?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Trump says things that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t check out, right?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Woodward said in an interview with the AP. Using a phrase from the Watergate era, the reporter and bestselling author added that his mission was to determine \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat did he know and when did he know it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Related:Trump responds to Woodward book saying he played down coronavirus: \u00e2\u0080\u0098We had to show calm\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And see:Trump knew the coronavirus was \u00e2\u0080\u0098deadly stuff\u00e2\u0080\u0099 but wanted to \u00e2\u0080\u0098play it down,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 according to Woodward book But Woodward\u00e2\u0080\u0099s critics accused him of being mostly interested in sales of his new book, titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cRage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cBob Woodward\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nonfeasance in the face of this disaster should stand with Walter Duranty\u00e2\u0080\u0099s covering for Stalin in the matter of the Ukrainian famine as eternal embarrassments to journalism and to simple humanity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d wrote Charles P. Pierce in an Esquire column. Pierce is among the commentators suggesting that Woodward\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behavior has been as bad as Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, while many others have said Trump deserves more blame."}]}
