Palantir filed Tuesday for a direct listing, which allows the company\u2019s shares to be sold on the open market but does not involve the sale of fresh shares like an initial public offering. The approach has grown popular for well-funded, mature startups, being used in recent years by another enterprise-software startup, Slack Technologies Inc. WORK, +3.36% , as well as Spotify Technology SA. SPOT, +0.08% . Palantir became infamous for selling big-data software that helped to surveil citizens and conduct warfare, the type of contracts that employees at Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOGL, +1.82% GOOG, +1.97% Google, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +3.01% , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +2.48% and Salesforce.com Inc. CRM, +2.21% have sought to end at their companies. Chief Executive and co-founder Alexander Karp led off the company\u2019s filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission with a letter that defended that business and excoriated Silicon Valley, as he moves the company to Denver from Palo Alto, Calif. Read: Palantir takes swings at Silicon Valley on its way to Wall Street Deeper in the filing, though, Palantir details how it has moved past just working for the government to push its software to sales of three-quarters-of-a-billion dollars last year. The company revealed that a little more than half \u2014 53% \u2014 of its customers come from the private sector instead of government, even as Palantir considers different divisions in the same government departments as separate customers. Palantir was co-founded by Karp, Facebook Inc. FB, +0.26% investor and board member Peter Thiel, and Stephen Cohen, who serves as president. The company originally received funding from the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s In-Q-Tel arm to develop Gotham, its first software platform that launched in 2008 and is built specifically for government uses. \u201cDefense agencies in the United States then began using Gotham to investigate potential threats and to help protect soldiers from improvised explosive devices,\u201d Palantir disclosed in its filing. \u201cToday, the platform is widely used by government agencies in the United States and its allies.\u201d In 2016, Palantir launched a second platform, Foundry, that it has sold to commercial entities; Airbus SE AIR, -0.20% EADSY, -0.25% was used as an example of a private-sector customer in the filing. The growth of Foundry is what moved Palantir\u2019s customer base toward the private sector, though governments can and do use the newer program as well. While the majority of Palantir customers may be commercial businesses, that doesn\u2019t mean the majority of its revenue comes from those contracts. Palantir had only 125 customers in the first half of this year that paid an average of $5.6 million each in 2019, but its largest customers \u2014 which Palantir does not name \u2014 have a much larger average. \u201cOur top 20 customers, based on our revenue in 2019, generated $495.2 million in revenue, or 67% of our total revenue in that period,\u201d Palantir disclosed in its filing. \u201cFrom those top 20 customers, we generated an average revenue per customer of $24.8 million during 2019.\u201d Opinion: A tale of two $2 billion Chinese IPOs headed in very different directions Palantir said that it had contracts with government entities for an additional $1.2 billion in business on its books, and an additional $2.6 billion in \u201cindefinite delivery, indefinite quantity\u201d contracts that are not counted because the funding has not yet been determined. \u201cOur partnerships with government agencies in the United States and abroad have had and will continue to have a significant impact on our business,\u201d the company stated. Palantir revealed in its SEC filing that revenue grew to $742.6 million in 2019 from $595.4 million in 2018, while losses stayed even at more than half a billion dollars a year \u2014 $579.6 million in 2019 and $580 million in 2018. In the first six months of this year, Palantir recorded a loss of $164.7 million on revenue of $481.2 million, after recording a loss of $280.5 million on sales of $322.7 million in the same period of 2019. While attacking Silicon Valley, Palantir still is retaining some of the DNA of the tech hub, especially in regards to retaining power with its founders after going public, just as Mark Zuckerberg maintains control of Facebook and Sergey Brin and Larry Page still rule over Google. The company created a three-tiered stock structure that gives one vote to publicly available shares, 10 votes to class B insider shares, and \u201cvariable\u201d votes to \u201cclass F\u201d shares owned by its three co-founders. The collective class F shares will hold up to 49.99% of votes, while other shares owned by the trio will allow them to effectively control the company. The company said that its business has not been materially impacted adversely by the COVID-19 pandemic, and that it may help Palantir\u2019s business.

Palantir listed a dozen banks that are acting as financial advisers on the deal, with Morgan Stanley as the main consultant with the designated market maker, which will determine the opening price of the shares. Palantir joins a parade of software companies filing this week to enter the public markets. At least five software companies filed with the SEC on Monday, including Asana Inc., which was co-founded by a Facebook co-founder and will also undergo a direct listing. Snowflake Inc., Unity Software Inc., Sumo Logic and Jfrog Ltd. also filed for IPOs on Monday."}]}
