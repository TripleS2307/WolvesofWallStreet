And\u00c2 to some, the image of thousands of Trump supporters crowding into polling places to monitor voters looks like voter intimidation, a practice long used in the U.S. by political parties to suppress one side\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vote and affect an election\u00e2\u0080\u0099s outcome. In the\u00c2 history of voter suppression\u00c2 in the U.S. \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including attempts to stop\u00c2 Black\u00c2 and\u00c2 Latino people\u00c2 from voting \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Republican tactics in the 1981 New Jersey gubernatorial race are worth highlighting. That incident sparked a court order \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a \u00e2\u0080\u009cconsent decree\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093 forbidding the GOP from using a variety of voter intimidation methods, including armed poll watchers. The 2020 presidential election will be the first in nearly 40 years conducted without the protections afforded by that decree.The National Ballot Security Task Force In November 1981, voters in several cities saw posters at polling places printed in bright red letters. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWARNING,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they read. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis area is being patrolled by\u00c2 the National Ballot Security Task Force.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And voters soon encountered the patrols themselves. About 200 were deployed statewide, many of them uniformed and carrying guns. In Trenton, patrol members asked a Black voter for her registration card and turned her away when she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t produce it. Latino voters were similarly prevented from voting in Vineland, while in Newark some voters were physically chased from the polls by patrolmen, one of whom warned a poll worker not to stay at her post after dark. Similar scenes played out in at least two other cities, Camden and Atlantic City. Weeks later, after a recount, Republican\u00c2 Thomas Kean\u00c2 won the election by fewer than 1,800 votes. Democrats, however, soon won a significant victory. With local civil rights activists, they discovered that the \u00e2\u0080\u009cballot security\u00e2\u0080\u009d operation was a joint project of the state and national Republican committees. They filed suit in December 1981,\u00c2 charging Republicans with \u00e2\u0080\u009cefforts to intimidate, threaten and coerce\u00c2 duly qualified black and Hispanic voters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In November 1982, the case was settled when the\u00c2 Republican committees signed a federal consent decree\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a court order applicable to activities anywhere in the U.S. \u00e2\u0080\u0093 agreeing not to use race in selecting targets for ballot security activities and to refrain from deploying armed poll watchers. That order\u00c2 expired in 2018\u00c2 after Democrats failed to convince a judge to renew it. As\u00c2 a professor\u00c2 who teaches and\u00c2 writes\u00c2 about New Jersey history, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m alarmed by the expiration because I know that Republicans in 1981 relied not only on armed poll watchers but also on a history of white vigilantism and intimidation in the Garden State. These issues\u00c2 resonate\u00c2 today in the midst of the Black Lives Matter movement and continued GOP attempts to\u00c2 suppress the 2020 vote\u00c2 in numerous states. U.S. Rep.

Getty Images The Republican \u00e2\u0080\u0098ballot security\u00e2\u0080\u0099 plan Considered an early referendum on Ronald Reagan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidency, New Jersey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 1981 gubernatorial race held special meaning for Republicans nationwide. Kean \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with\u00c2 campaign manager Roger Stone\u00c2 at the helm \u00e2\u0080\u0093 promised corporate tax cuts and relied heavily on Reagan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s endorsement. To secure victory, state and national Republican party officials devised a project they claimed would prevent Democratic cheating at the polls. In the summer of 1981, the Republican National Committee sent an operative named John A. Kelly to New Jersey to run the ballot security effort. Kelly had first been hired by the Republican National Committee in 1980 to work in the Reagan campaign, and he served as one of the\u00c2 RNC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s liaisons to the Reagan White House. Later, after he was revealed as the organizer of the National Ballot Security Task Force \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and after The New York Times discovered that he had\u00c2 lied about graduating from Notre Dame and had been arrested for impersonating a police officer\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Republicans distanced themselves from him. In August 1981, under the guise of the National Ballot Security Task Force, Kelly sent about 200,000 letters marked \u00e2\u0080\u009creturn to sender\u00e2\u0080\u009d to voters in heavily Black and Latino districts. Those whose letters were returned had their names added to a list of voters to be challenged at the polls on Election Day, a tactic known as\u00c2 voter caging. In the Newark area, Kelly produced a list of 20,000 voters whom he deemed potentially fraudulent. He then hired local operatives to organize patrols, ostensibly to keep such fraud at bay. To run the Newark operation, he hired Anthony Imperiale.Newark\u00e2\u0080\u0099s white vigilante Imperiale, in turn, hired off-duty police officers and employees of his private business, the Imperiale Security Police, to patrol voting sites in the city. The gun-toting, barrel-chested former Marine had first adopted the security role during\u00c2 Newark\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 1967 uprising\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 five days of protests and a deadly occupation of the city by police and the National Guard following the police beating of a Black cab driver. During the uprising, Imperiale organized patrols of his predominantly white neighborhood to keep \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe riots\u00e2\u0080\u009d out. Soon, Imperiale became a hero of white backlash politics. His\u00c2 opposition to police reform\u00c2 earned him widespread support from law enforcement. And his\u00c2 fight against Black housing development\u00c2 in Newark\u00e2\u0080\u0099s North Ward delighted many of his neighbors. By the end of the 1970s, Hollywood was\u00c2 making a movie\u00c2 based on his activities. After serving as an independent in both houses of the state legislature,\u00c2 Imperiale became a Republican in 1979. Two years later, he campaigned with Kean. Once in office, the new governor named Imperiale director of a new one-man state Office of Community Safety \u00e2\u0080\u0093 an appointment often interpreted as reward for Imperiale\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leadership of the ballot efforts in Newark, but stymied when\u00c2 Democrats refused to fund the position.Outcome and legacy Despite Kean\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slim margin of victory, Democrats at the time were careful not to claim that Republican voter suppression efforts had decided the election. (In 2016, the former\u00c2 Democratic candidate claimed they did indeed make the difference.) Rather, the state and national Democratic committees brought suit against the Republican National Committee to ensure it couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t again use such methods anywhere. For nearly 40 years \u00e2\u0080\u0093 through\u00c2 amendments\u00c2 and\u00c2 challenges\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the resulting consent decree\u00c2 helped curtail\u00c2 voter suppression tactics. Since the decree\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expiration in 2018, Republicans have ramped up their\u00c2 recruitment of poll watchers\u00c2 for the 2020 presidential election. Last November, Trump campaign lawyer Justin Clark \u00e2\u0080\u0093 calling the decree\u00e2\u0080\u0099s absence \u00e2\u0080\u009ca huge, huge, huge, huge deal\u00e2\u0080\u009d for the party \u00e2\u0080\u0093 promised a larger, better-funded and \u00e2\u0080\u009cmore aggressive\u00e2\u0080\u009d program of Election Day operations. The Trump campaign is claiming, as Republicans did in 1981, that Democrats \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill be up to their old dirty tricks\u00e2\u0080\u009d and has vowed to \u00e2\u0080\u009ccover every polling place in the country\u00e2\u0080\u009d with workers to ensure an honest election and reelect the president. This November, Republican tactics in 1981 are worth remembering. They demonstrate that the safeguarding of polling places from supposedly fraudulent voters and of public places from Black bodies share not only a logic. They also share a history.
