Pablo Blazquez Dominguez/Getty Images Madrid\u00e2\u0080\u0099s High Court ruled on Thursday that it wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t approve recent COVID-19 restrictions imposed on the region by the central government. The regional government has objected to the new rules, which include limits on capacity for businesses and limits on travel, without good reason, for individuals in affected regions such as Madrid. They were put in place as of Friday for any region that met criteria, such as Madrid, where cases have been soaring. The local government has appealed the restrictions and argued they will damage the economy further. According to El Pa\u00c3\u00ads, the high court must now rule on whether to suspend the Madrid restrictions, while considering the local government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s appeal against the measures."}]}
