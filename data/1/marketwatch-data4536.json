CMG, +0.01% said Monday that it will begin testing Cilantro-Lime Cauliflower Rice starting July 15 in 55 restaurants in Denver and around Wisconsin. The item will cost an additional $2. Cauliflower rice is one of the top requests the company has gotten as a new menu addition, said Chris Brandt, Chipotle's chief marketing officer in a statement. The item is compliant with Keto, vegan and other special diets, and is an alternative to brown or white rice that cuts carbs, the company said. The cauliflower rice dish is going through Chipotle's \"stage-gate\" testing process that ultimately led to the addition of carne asada, queso blanco, and other new menu items. Chipotle stock has rallied 33.6% for the year to date while the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% is down 1.4% for the period."}]}
