But several religious precepts might actually help investors if they paid them more mind, judging by the long-term returns of Amana Growth Fund AMIGX, +1.54%. The fund avoids companies in activities prohibited by Islamic law. That brings the expected ban on alcohol, \u00e2\u0080\u009csin\u00e2\u0080\u009d and pork-processing companies. But it also layers in core investing principles that help this fund\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long-term outperformance. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099d probably be wise to follow these concepts \u00e2\u0080\u0094 described below \u00e2\u0080\u0094 whatever your religion. I also take a look at other principles you should adopt because they help explain this fund\u00e2\u0080\u0099s record, according to Scott Klimo, now lead manager of the fund after co-managing it since 2012. The fund beats its Morningstar category (large-cap growth) by 1.3 to 1.8 percentage points annualized over the past three and five years, with less volatility to boot, according to Morningstar. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a look at investing concepts you can borrow from this fund to boost your returns and, who knows, get more peace of mind in the process.1. Avoid debt Islamic law prohibits paying or receiving interest, so banks are out. But this also contributes to the imposition of limits on company debt. Any businesses with a debt-to-market-cap ratio above 33% get the boot. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe believe that financial sustainability is integral to the success of a business,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Klimo told me in a recent interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done multiple studies, and it just works. It creates a nice tailwind, and this contributes to performance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A basic investing principle is at work here: The easiest way to make money is to not lose it. Heavily leveraged companies can blow up, so avoiding them reduces risk. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRisk reduction goes hand in hand with performance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Klimo. This rule keeps the fund out of notoriously volatile areas like basic materials, real estate, telecom and banks. This means the fund bounces around less than the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% \u00c2 and Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39%. The Amana Growth Fund is one of the least-volatile funds in its category, says Morningstar analyst David Kathman.2. Stop watching every tick and overtrading Spend any time on Twitter and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll notice how mesmerized people get watching the market and their stocks trade all day, commenting on every little move. This is pretty stupid, and a big waste of time. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make your stocks go up any faster. It drains energy by creating stress. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople just bang their heads against the wall sometimes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Klimo. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSturm and drang doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really add value.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This is valuable advice, both for reducing stress, and for freeing up time for activities that actually help \u00e2\u0080\u0094 like actual research. Because Islamic law discourages speculation, excessive portfolio trading is out at the Amana Growth fund. It has a decidedly long-term approach. The average holding period is greater than 10 years. It has held Apple AAPL, +1.74% \u00c2 since maybe before you were born \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the early 1990s. So when COVID-19 hit the headlines in March, Klimo didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t scour holdings for names to ditch because they might fall more. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe said we own good companies and they will come out strong on the other side. So it will be fine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Klimo. Part of this long-term doctrine means having the sense to stay in good names even if they look expensive. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will hold if the operational thesis is still intact,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says the fund manager. For example, Amana Growth has a 6% position in Intuit INTU, +2.03%. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a really big holding given that many mutual funds limit size of a single holding to 1%-2% of the overall portfolio. The tax and financial software company looks pricey with a forward P/E in the upper 30 range. Growth may get hit as COVID-19 puts customers out of business. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut they have a tremendous long-term double-digit earnings growth track record,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Klimo. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe still like the story long term.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Near-term, Intuit would get a boost if Joe Biden becomes president in January, which would bring lots changes to federal tax laws, in turn supporting demand for its products. When does Klimo sell? Triggers include a change in the original investment thesis, or signs of management malfeasance. 3. Invest in companies with a sustainable competitive advantage A favorite is companies with a clear technology edge. Klimo has a 4.7% position in ASML ASML, +2.12% \u00c2 ASML, +1.83%, which makes lithography machines that produce chips. ASML has a lock on the market with 75% share. As this business transitions to \u00e2\u0080\u009cextreme ultraviolet lithography,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which uses ultraviolet wavelengths in chip production, ASML will have 100% market share, predicts Klimo. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey will just own the market. They have a technological edge over everybody.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Another example: TJX TJX, -0.18%, a 2.8% position. Klimo thinks TJX, whose stores include T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods, is so good at discount retailing and setting up the lure of the \u00e2\u0080\u009ctreasure hunt,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it has its own niche \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and a protective moat that keeps competitors at bay. Now, with retailers going out of business because of the slowdown, TJX will be able to find even more bargains for shoppers, which will help results. 4. Invest in high quality of management You can spot them by looking at their track records. Klimo owns the home improvement retailer Lowe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s LOW, +1.38% in part because Marvin Ellison took over as CEO in 2018, after years of producing great results at Home Depot HD, +0.49%. Now he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s using many of the same tactics to boost profit margins at Lowe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0094 like fine-tuning inventory management and online operations. Klimo is also sticking with Apple because of the \u00e2\u0080\u009ctremendous\u00e2\u0080\u009d leadership of CEO Tim Cook. Klimo cites Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s success with services. Popular offerings like Apple Pay, iTunes and the App Store, have thrived under Cook. Unlike skeptics, Klimo isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry Apple will stumble in smartphone innovation. He expects new 5G-capable models coming out in the fall to be a hit. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe still have supreme confidence in the investment thesis.\u00e2\u0080\u009d5. Go with diversity at the top Klimo likes gender diversity in top management and boards because he says it improves company performance. Here, he cites holding Est\u00c3\u00a9e Lauder EL, +0.17%, \u00c2 which has five women on its executive team including the CFO, and seven women among its 16 board members. Klimo expects continued growth through expansion in China and other parts of Asia. He also rejects the theory that working from home stifles cosmetics demand. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople still want to look good on their Zoom calls.\u00e2\u0080\u009d What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ahead for the economy Klimo also likes Est\u00c3\u00a9e Lauder\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history of holding up in a weak economy. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll come in handy, because he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect a \u00e2\u0080\u009cV-shaped\u00e2\u0080\u009d recovery. He cites the continuing spread of COVID-19, which will worsen when flu season arrives. Even if governments don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t impose broad lockdowns, companies will shut facilities and stores. See the latest MarketWatch coronavirus coverage here. Another risk few people are talking about: State governments\u00e2\u0080\u0099 balanced-budget mandates. Shortfalls in tax revenue will bring large cuts in state services, a big part of the economy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a real big problem coming down the pike from the perspective of state budgets.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Not that any of this matters for Klimo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investment strategy. If history is any guide, his fund will just stick with its winners through any worsening of the economy.
