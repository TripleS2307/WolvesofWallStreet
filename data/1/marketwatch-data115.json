It\u2019s The Trump Show and we\u2019re just living in it. From the shocking news that the president tested positive for coronavirus and was checked into the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for three nights, to his proclamation that there would be no fiscal stimulus, to his next-day reversal, President Donald Trump dominated the talk in markets over the past week. We covered the ups, and the downs, for airline and travel-focused ETFs: a lot of turbulence, you might say. Also, the materials sector started to strengthen, and financials jumped as markets began to price in a Democratic sweep that could boost fiscal spending and reflate yields. That\u2019s reflected in weekly fund flows, shown at the bottom of this page. Bond funds sold off, but bank funds rallied. Thanks for reading. \u201cA fascinating time to be an active manager\u201d A fund that launched in 2019 is having a terrific 2020. The Hoya Capital Housing ETF HOMZ, +0.00% initially branded itself as the only ETF to cover the entire housing market ecosystem, from builders to realtors to REITs to Home Depot. But it was struggling to gather assets. So in August, the fund\u2019s founder, Alex Pettee, rebranded it to more directly compete with the two better-known \u201chomebuilder\u201d ETFs, the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF XHB, +0.54% and the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF ITB, +0.79%, both of which also are laden with stocks that aren\u2019t homebuilders. Among ETFs that picked up the most incoming money last month, there was only one actively managed fund in the top 20: ARK Invest\u2019s flagship fund, the Innovation ETF ARKK, +2.17%. For all the recent excitement about \u201csemitransparent\u201d ETFs and \u201cactive non-transparent\u201d ETFs, ARK\u2019s founder, Cathie Wood, an unabashed and active stock picker, just happens to prefer the transparency that good old-fashioned ETFs provide. MarketWatch sat down with Wood, virtually, in June, after her terrific run through the spring. In the disruption following the March market swoon, she was having a great time. \u201cIt\u2019s a fascinating time to be an active manager,\u201d she said at the time. Wood\u2019s career always has focused on innovative tech, including products and services that span sectors and industries and others, like remote learning and medicine, that seemingly leapfrog into the future. An earlier long conversation with her can be found here. In the year to date, ARKK\u2019s share price basically has doubled itself: it\u2019s up 98.2% as of the close of business Wednesday. That compares with a 26% gain for the Nasdaq COMP, +1.39% over the same stretch. ARKK\u2019s assets under management also mushroomed: up $4.2 billion so far in 2020, according to FactSet, to $8.9 billion. \u201cThe ARK lineup, and ARKK in particular, take thematic investing, which has been gaining traction, and do stock picking with a very patient approach,\u201d said Todd Rosenbluth, CFRA head of ETF research. \u201cShe\u2019s been right a lot. It\u2019s just impressive. It\u2019s a strategy that combines a few different innovative themes. It\u2019s also a swing for the fences strategy, and she\u2019s been connecting and hitting home runs. It\u2019s a home run year. Will it continue? That\u2019s to be determined, but we have a five star rating on the ETF, in part, based on its performance and, in part, based on its holdings.\u201d In addition to her active approach, Wood is well-known for being a Tesla uber-bull. Her most recent call is for a $7,000 share price. No, we didn\u2019t add an extra zero. Is there an ETF for that? Is there an ETF for every corner of the financial markets? With the launch last week of the Defiance Next Gen SPAC Derived ETF SPAK, +0.03%, it seems likely. SPACs \u2013 Special Purpose Acquisition Companies \u2013 are sometimes called \u201cblank-check companies.\u201d They raise capital, then identify a company already in operation as an acquisition target. As part of the merger process, the new entity goes public \u2013 and shares in the SPAC convert to equity in the new company. The traditional IPO market has been a \u201cclosed ecosystem\u201d for most ordinary investors, said Paul Dellaquila, Defiance\u2019s president. An investment in SPAK offers access to companies at the very early stages of their life cycle, with the promise of outsize returns ahead. Right now, the ETF\u2019s portfolio is heavily weighted toward companies that already went public via a SPAC, with only about 20% allocated to pre-IPO companies. Dellaquila expects that to balance out more as the SPAC marketplace matures and individual SPACs become more liquid. For now, that means the portfolio is tilted toward some names investors probably know well: 18.6% is in DraftKings Inc. DKNG, -4.51%, and 4.2% is in Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc. SPCE, -3.12%. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to replace an investor\u2019s core holding,\u201d Dellaquila told MarketWatch. He considers it a good addition to the alternatives section of the portfolio.
