A broad and vicious risk-off mood took hold of Wall Street on Thursday, puncturing a bullish uptrend that had been fueled by signs of progressively successful reopenings from coronavirus lockdowns. However, doubts raised about the pace and quality of the recovery from the current recession raised by Powell on Wednesday and signs of rising cases of COVID-19 forced investors to reassess their positions, experts said. The number of U.S. coronavirus infections passed the two million mark and over 112,000 Americans have died, according to Johns Hopkins University. Despite fewer cases being recorded in some cities and states, the seven-day average of new cases over the past two weeks is still rising in more than 20 states, leading investors to worry about a second wave of the epidemic just as business activity is resuming. The global case tally for the coronavirus climbed to 7.39 million on Thursday.. The death toll rose to 417,022. On Wednesday, the Fed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s updated policy statement and projections indicated that it expects a 6.5% contraction by the end of the year on a year-over-year basis, with the unemployment rate ending at 9.3%, well above the Fed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s estimate of the long-run rate forecast of 4.1%. The central bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dour outlook has a lot to do with the stock market selloff, said Kristina Hooper, Invesco chief global market strategist. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe stock market has almost had blinders on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hooper said in an interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMore than one in three companies in the S&P 500 are dispensing with earnings guidance. So investors have anchored to data, which has been relatively positive about reopenings in various states, improvements in PMIs and the jobs report last week. In one fell swoop Jay Powell threw a lot of cold water on that narrative.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hooper thinks the market moves of this week aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily the start of a sustained leg downward. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTypically the initial reaction to the Fed press conference is not the subsequent reaction. There needs to be some digestion by investors.\u00e2\u0080\u009d President Trump announced he will resume holding election rallies with the first in Tulsa, Okla., on June 19 but he isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expected to require that attendees practice social distancing. Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the U.S. shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t shut down the economy again even if there is another surge in coronavirus cases. FED RECAP: Fed provides update on economic outlook and policy thinking In U.S. economic data Thursday, another 1.54 million Americans filed for initial jobless claims, the government said. That beat expectations for 1.565 million people seeking unemployment benefits, according to the Econoday consensus. Although new jobless claims have been falling since March, more than 2.2 million applications for unemployment compensation were filed in the last week of May through state and federal relief programs. That is almost as many as the 2.5 million jobs regained by the economy in the entire month. Producer prices moved fractionally upward in May, the government said, notching their first increase in four months. Economists had forecast another decline.Which stocks are in focus?
