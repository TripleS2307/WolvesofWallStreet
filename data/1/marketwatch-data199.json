(Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images) The U.S. budget deficit hit a record $3.1 trillion in the recently concluded 2020 budget year, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected Thursday. \u201cRelative to the size of the economy, the deficit\u2014at an estimated 15.2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP)\u2014was the largest since 1945, and 2020 was the fifth consecutive year in which the deficit increased as a percentage of GDP,\u201d the CBO said in its monthly forecast. The Treasury Department and the Office of Management and Budget will release actual figures later in the month, if the agencies hold with past practice. Notably, the CBO figure, based on daily Treasury data, was $180 billion less than it had projected only a few weeks ago, as revenues came in $123 billion above those projections and spending came in slightly below \u2014 by $56 billion \u2014 forecasts."}]}
