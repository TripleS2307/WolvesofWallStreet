But would they approve of your investments?", "body": "Most individual investors don\u2019t see themselves as activists. But in the aftermath of the May 25 killing of George Floyd while in Minneapolis police custody, many investors are looking at racial and societal problems and considering how their investment choices can support their values \u2014 including structuring a portfolio to advance racial equality and economic justice. \u201cPeople really want to understand the impact that they\u2019re having and what they\u2019re actually supporting with their investments,\u201d said Johny Mair, co-founder of Ethic, a New York City-based asset management platform that enables advisers to construct ESG (environmental, social and governance) portfolios based on a client\u2019s sustainable criteria and priorities. The key is to customize a portfolio that directly addresses protesters\u2019 concerns. Even though many companies align themselves with Black Lives Matter and express alarm at incidents of police brutality, there\u2019s no guarantee that these same companies are model corporate citizens with an impeccable history of socially responsible behavior.

Examples include publicly traded REITs (real estate investment trusts) that invest in private prisons and companies with financial ties to for-profit prisons. Some analysts argue that private prisons capitalize on mass incarceration trends that disproportionately affect minorities. Makers of firearms, as well as distributors and retailers that sell weapons, might fail the test. Companies across all sectors that do not pay what activists deem a fair, living wage also may be unfit for consideration, particularly because many frontline workers are people of color. \u201cRacial diversity on the board [of directors] and management level is pretty important,\u201d said Justina Lai, chief impact officer at San Francisco-based Wetherby Asset Management. \u201cIt has a huge impact on leadership, hiring practices, policies rolled out to workers and mentorship\u201d within the organization. \u201c When choosing municipal bonds, metrics such as arrest statistics in a community and its use on public safety fees to finance operations can prove revealing. \u201d Lai encourages concerned clients to ask their financial advisers, \u201cHow do you select investments for my portfolio?\u201d When choosing municipal bonds, for instance, metrics such as arrest statistics in a community and its use on public safety fees to finance operations can prove revealing. \u201cToo much reliance on public safety fees might indicate overly aggressive policing,\u201d Lai said. \u201cYou can also look at controversy flags for high-profile incidents of police brutality.\u201d Many of America\u2019s most familiar brands are declaring their support for peaceful protesters and their goals. But an eloquent message posted on the company\u2019s website is only a starting point for screening whether a corporation truly walks the talk. \u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of a danger in trying to get laser-focused on a specific issue when looking at ESG [mutual] funds,\u201d said Dave Nadig, chief investment officer at ETF Trends in Irvine, Calif. \u201cTake racial inequality. What data point would you get from Nike to address racial inequality?\u201d Nike\u2019s decision to be involved in Black Lives Matter and run ads promoting its commitment to its cause may be one criteria, Nadig points out, but, he adds, that alone may not suffice if you set more rigorous standards for picking investments. You can also align your money with protesters by choosing a bank that\u2019s deeply engaged at a local level. Community development financial institutions (CDFIs) include credit unions with stated missions to, say, advance equality and serve economically disadvantaged individuals. Said Ebony Perkins, manager of investor and community relations for Self-Help Credit Union in Durham, N.C.: \u201cFocusing on where you place your cash is the quickest and easiest way to make an impact.\u201d Read: How activist investors risk triggering even more automation, job losses and wealth inequality More: How the coronavirus pandemic could change \u2018do-good\u2019 investing for the better"}]}
