But many of the best performers were really bounce backs from the doldrums of March, when the market hit bottom during the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Some stocks are still down for 2020, but there were also some \u201creal\u201d winners \u2014 ones that were up significantly in the quarter and the first half of the year. Below are lists of stocks that rose the most during the second quarter. \u2022 The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% climbed 17.8% in the second quarter, but was down 9.6% for the first half of 2020. (All gains and losses in this article exclude dividends.) \u2022 The S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% added 20% in the second quarter, and ended Tuesday down 4% for 2020. \u2022 The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.39% soared 30.6% during the second quarter and is now up 12.1% for 2020. There are still hundreds of large-cap U.S. stocks with double-digit declines for the year. To lift the sagging economy, the Federal Reserve is supporting the market with extremely low interest rates and a vast increase in the money supply through securities purchases. In addition, the federal government is giving unprecedented aid to people and businesses affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Rising forward valuations Here\u2019s chart showing the S&P 500 trading at its highest forward price-to-earnings valuation since February 2001: FactSet The S&P 500 traded for 21.6 times weighted consensus forward earnings estimates at the close June 30, up from a forward P/E valuation of 18.3 at the end of 2019. That forward P/E ratio is up, even thought the S&P 500 is down this year, because analysts have cut their earnings estimates following the economic devastation caused by the Covid-19 outbreak. So there are myriad warnings of an asset bubble. James Bullard, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, said last week that he didn\u2019t see evidence of an asset bubble. Charles Evans, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said the economy might need even further stimulus, and that U.S. interest rates may head into negative territory.Dow Jones Industrial Average Here\u2019s how the 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average performed in the second quarter: Company Ticker Price change - second quarter, 2020 Price change - first half, 2020 Price change - 2019 Apple Inc.
