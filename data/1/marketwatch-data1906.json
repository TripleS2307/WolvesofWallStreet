What is there not to be happy about \u2014 the stock market mostly rises, and making money seems easy. While newly minted investors are focusing on running up small, speculative stocks, institutions are hiding in big-cap tech stocks. For prudent investors, the time to understand two big hidden stock market risks is now \u2014 when the market is high. Let\u2019s review the Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF DIA, +0.57%, which tracks the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56%, and see how it compares to the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87%, Amazon ( AMZN, +3.01%, Apple AAPL, +1.74%, Alphabet GOOG, +1.97% GOOGL, +1.82% and Facebook FB, +0.26%. \u2022 As popular as Apple stock is among investors, it has significantly underperformed shares of Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook. \u2022 Apple just reported blowout earnings in spite of the pandemic. The company also announced a four-for-one stock split. Apple\u2019s stock is flying high. \u2022 Amazon was expected to report great earnings as it became a quintessential utility for consumers during the pandemic. Amazon outdid most estimates. \u2022 In spite of a boycott by advertisers \u2014 and an advertising slump in general \u2014 Facebook\u2019s earnings were a blowout \u2014 just like Apple\u2019s. \u2022 Alphabet earnings were excellent but not a blowout. However, by some measures, Alphabet is the cheapest of the four stocks. \u2022 Charts of Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook stocks are as bullish as they get. The companies\u2019 earnings are accelerating. If they can produce excellent earnings during a pandemic, imagine what they can do when the economy starts booming and there is a vaccine. Their market dominance is increasing and so is the range of their offerings. Two hidden risks Before sending me hate mail for pointing out the risks, understand that The Arora Report is bullish on these stocks. Amazon, Facebook, Alphabet and Apple are in The Arora Report model portfolio. And my job is to help investors. While many investors focus on the rewards of the stock market, it is more important to focus on the risks in this environment, where excessive government borrowing and excessive money printing by the Federal Reserve are inflating the stock market bubble. Here are the two hidden risks: \u2022 A part of the strength in these four companies is that they have become quintessential utilities. Consumers have very little real choice to go elsewhere. Customarily, utilities in the United States have been regulated and there have been serious regulatory limits on the profits they can make. If you watched the recent congressional hearing, you may have already reached an unmistakable conclusion that regulation is coming. It is a question of \u201cwhen,\u201d not \u201cif.\u201d \u2022 These four stocks have become crowded trades. The best way to understand a crowded trade is to think of a fast-moving boat in which everybody is on one side. The boat may keep on going safely for a long time, but it takes only a small wave for the boat to capsize. Investors ought to properly restructure their stock market portfolios to account for these risks. Disclosure: Arora Report portfolios have positions in Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Facebook.
