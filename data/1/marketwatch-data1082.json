Governments across Europe are grappling with rising infections, including in countries like Germany that appeared to have the crisis under control months ago, and some, including Italy, France and the U.K., are considering or have imposed new emergency measures. South America, parts of Asia and the Middle East are still counting thousands of new cases a day with no sign the virus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spread is slowing, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University, a global benchmark for tracking the virus. Dr. Michael Ryan, head of the World Health Organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s emergencies program, said Monday the true toll from COVID-19 likely exceeds 1 million. Experts have cautioned that there are discrepancies between how data are collected and reported in different countries. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen you count anything, you never count it perfectly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ryan told reporters at a press briefing in Geneva. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I can assure you that the current numbers are likely an underestimate of the true toll of COVID.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098Responsible leadership matters.

Experts have said the numbers would be lower if the U.S. had stuck with a consistent approach to the pandemic from the outset, and implemented the wide-scale testing, contact tracing and isolation of infected patients, quarantining, social distancing and face-mask wearing, that have proven effective in those places that have got the outbreak under control. United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00c3\u00b3nio Guterres said the challenge can be overcome, but the world must learn from its mistakes. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } \u00e2\u0080\u009cResponsible leadership matters.

Citing documents, as well as interviews with former and current officials, the newspaper report said the pressure on the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leading public health agency came during the summer months, at a time when parental anxiety about sending children back into classrooms was nearing a peak.

It comes just hours before President Donald Trump is to debate his presidential rival, Democrat Joe Biden, with the pandemic expected to take center stage, ahead even of the scandal involving Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tax record on which the New York Times reported over the weekend, with a second installment out Tuesday.

The real story is the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal debts coming due Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, went on CNN late Monday and attempted to downplay differences with White House coronavirus task force colleague Dr. Scott Atlas, saying the real enemy remains COVID-19. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe bad guy is the virus,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe bad guy is not the person on the other side of your opinion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Those comments came after an NBC report that CDC head Robert Redfield had been overheard during a phone conversation on a plane saying of Atlas: \u00e2\u0080\u009cEverything he says is false.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Atlas, a radiologist who has no infectious-disease experience, was added to the task force in August, after regular appearances on Fox News, where he shared views that aligned with those espoused by Trump. Altas has pushed for states to reopen aggressively, played down the need for face masks and said children are not in danger from the virus. He has supported the development of herd immunity \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which could kill millions of Americans. A number of members of the medical faculty at Stanford \u00e2\u0080\u0094 where Atlas is a Hoover fellow \u00e2\u0080\u0094 recently signed an open letter condemning Atlas, saying his comments run counter to scientific evidence and undermine public health efforts.

There are just 18 active cases in the country, all of whom are isolated or in quarantine. New Zealand was widely praised for its initial handling of the pandemic, which has helped it keep cases and deaths to a minimum. The country has 1,835 confirmed cases and 25 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins data. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Mexico increased its estimated COVID-19 death toll to 89,612 on Monday, and raised its case tally to 870,699, or about 137,000 more than previously estimated, the Associated Press reported. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s after previous estimates that were based on test results that had not yet arrived. Officials also added two new groups: those who were never tested but showed symptoms, and those who had tests that could not be analyzed because they were not handled properly, the AP reported. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 President Donald Trump announced plans to distribute 150 million rapid COVID-19 tests made by Abbott Laboratories ABT, +1.02% in \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe coming weeks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Speaking at the White House, Trump said 100 million of the tests would go to states and territories to support efforts to allow schools to reopen, while 50 million would go to nursing homes, hospice facilities and other institutions that serve the most vulnerable. The White House announced the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s purchase of the tests from Abbott in late August.Latest tallies The global death toll from COVID-19 stands at 1.002 million, according to the Johns Hopkins data. At least 23.2 million people have recovered. Brazil has the second highest death toll after the U.S. at 142,058, but third highest case tally at 4.7 million. India is second to the U.S. by case tally at 6.1 million, and has the third highest death toll at 96,318. Mexico is fourth with 76,603 deaths and seventh with 733,717 cases. The U.K. has 42,090 deaths and 441,573 cases, the highest death toll in Europe and fifth highest in the world. China, where the illness was first reported late last year, has 90,509 cases and 4,739 deaths, according to its official numbers. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the economy saying? Consumer confidence rebounded in September to a pandemic-era high after the number of coronavirus cases declined and the economy marched ahead, a closely followed survey showed, as MarketWatch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Jeffry Bartash reported. The index of consumer confidence rose to 101.8 this month from 86.3 in August, the Conference Board said Tuesday. Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast the index would rise to 89.6. The level of confidence in August was also revised slightly higher after initially showing the lowest reading since the pandemic began more than six months ago.

Although millions of Americans remain out of work, more people are returning to their jobs and the unemployment rate has shown declines. Economists worry the end of federal aid will slow the recovery and make it harder to return to normal, but so far the U.S. has continued to plow ahead. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA more favorable view of current business and labor-market conditions, coupled with renewed optimism about the short-term outlook, helped spur this month\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rebound in confidence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at the Conference Board. Separately, the U.S. trade deficit in goods rose 3.5% in August to a record $82.9 billion, reflecting a sluggish rebound in exports that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weighing on the broader economy and could slow the recovery from the worst levels of the coronavirus-pandemic period. Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast a small decline in the trade gap.What are companies saying? \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Discount retailer Big Lots Inc. BIG, -0.72% expects a big jump in third-quarter same-store sales and guided toward per-share earnings that are well above the consensus.

The company posted a loss per share of 18 cents in the year-earlier period. Chief Executive Bruce Thorn said the company is on track to meet customer demand, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand early reads on Christmas are very encouraging.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Shares have gained 66% in the year to date, boosted by pandemic-related demand. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Hertz Global Holdings Inc. HTZ, -1.78% said that Kenny K. Cheung, recently promoted to executive vice president of finance, took on the role of chief financial officer last week. Cheung succeeded R. Eric Esper, promoted to CFO in August. Esper resigned to pursue a new opportunity but will remain with Hertz as chief accounting officer until Nov. 1 to assist in the transition. Esper had succeeded Jamere Jackson, who took the CFO reins in August 2018. The car-rental company filed for bankruptcy in May, hit by coronavirus-related travel and business restrictions and under the weight of previous debt.

MKC, +0.91% posted better-than-expected earnings for its fiscal third quarter, resumed guidance and announced a 2-for-1 stock split, saying it is still benefiting from dining at home during the pandemic. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur results for the third quarter continued to be significantly impacted by the sustained consumer preference for cooking more at home,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Chief Executive Lawrence Kurzius said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur updated 2020 outlook reflects the strength of these year-to-date results and our confidence in the sustainability of higher at home consumption trends,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.

Spinner is to retire after July 31, when his employment contract expires, or earlier if a successor is found.
