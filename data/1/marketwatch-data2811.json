MarketWatch photo illustration/iStockphoto Many of the biggest movers in commodities this year, including oil and precious metals, will continue to take the spotlight as the year draws on. Traders are trying to assess the effects of the pandemic on demand and are looking for signs of a global economic recovery. Year to date, the Bloomberg Commodities Index XX:BCOM, which is heavily weighted in energy, is down around 12%, with the Bloomberg Energy Subindex off almost 43% as of Sept. 8. \u201cMany commodities are trading well below their long-term incentive prices,\u201d says Alissa Corcoran, director of research at Kopernik Global Investors. As long as they continue to be in demand, however, these prices aren\u2019t sustainable, and a move to their \u201cincentive prices\u201d would motivate spending to keep supply in line with demand, she said. Energy commodities are among the biggest decliners, with U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude CL CLV20 losing almost 40% so far this year. Oil prices have been \u201cdriven down by reduced demand,\u201d said Corcoran. Oil below its long-term incentive price, which she estimates at $75 a barrel, is unlikely to stay at that level. On Sept. 8, U.S. and global benchmark oil futures BRN00 settled below $40 a barrel, the lowest since June. Still, John Echols, partner at Opportune, believes expectations for a slow restart of the global economy, and resulting tepid energy consumption growth, make it likely that crude oil and refined product prices will see only \u201cmodest increases\u201d from current levels. Then, as the economy \u201cmoves toward normal,\u201d and with U.S. drilling largely shut down, it\u2019s \u201cnatural to see the possibility of an upcycle in prices within the intermediate term\u201d of about 18 months. Outcomes related to the pandemic will be a \u201cclear driver\u201d for energy in coming months, he says. If the pandemic fades, then other factors, such as the U.S. presidential election, will come more into focus, Echols said. Meanwhile, most-active lumber futures LB00 had more than doubled for the year to a record high of $928.50 per 1,000 board feet on Sept. 1, with demand driven by home renovations and a move to the suburbs, as coronavirus restrictions slowed production, says Greg Kuta, president of lumber broker Westline Capital Strategies. The $1,000 area probably presents a \u201cceiling,\u201d right now, with $450 as a floor, he said. Commodity investors, however, will continue to eye moves in precious metals, which got a boost as the pandemic raised demand for gold and silver as a haven. Signs of some recovery in global economies led silver, which is also an industrial metal, to far outpace gold\u2019s rise. As of Sept. 8, silver futures SI00 SIZ20 traded around 50% higher year to date, while gold GC00 GCZ20 rose 27%. \u201cThe factors that have underpinned gold\u2019s move higher are still with us,\u201d said Ross Norman, chief executive officer of Metals Daily. Long-term drivers will continue to be 10-year U.S. Treasury yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y, and the U.S. presidential election will play a part. \u201cThe unclear outcome, in what is likely a close run race, will be to keep uncertainty high and by extension, gold high,\u201d Norman said. Metals Daily expects gold to potentially climb as high as $2,200 before year-end, \u201cwhich would give gold a 45% gain on the year,\u201d while silver may challenge the $35 level at year-end, which would represent a \u201cmassive\u201d 95% gain on the year, says Norman. Overall, commodities can be \u201cvery volatile\u201d in the short term, which \u201cwe view not as risk but as opportunity,\u201d says Corcoran. The \u201cbest opportunities to invest are when commodity prices are well below their incentive price,\u201d as is the current case for most commodities."}]}
