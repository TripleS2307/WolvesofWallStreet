How did benchmarks perform? The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% rose 177.10 points, or 0.7%, to end at 26,067.28, after trading as high as 26,109.49 at the start of the session.

Year-to-date the Dow is down 8.66%, the S&P 500 down 1.88% but the Nasdaq Composite is up 16.94%. What drove the market? Equity markets booked gains Wednesday, even as investors focused on the question of whether unabated increases in COVID-19 cases in a number of U.S. states would delay economic recovery. The U.S. reported 60,000 new coronavirus cases Tuesday, a single-day record, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The seven-day average for cases is higher than the 14-day average, an indication that the spread is intensifying, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of the publicly available health data. \u201cThe single-day spike kind of woke some investors up,\u201d Lindsey Bell, Ally Invest\u2019s chief investment strategist, told MarketWatch. Bell also expects the approaching corporate earnings reporting season in mid-July to provide reason for optimism, if only by showing the worst damage from the crisis has passed. \u201cEarnings expectations are still pretty dire, but it looks like the second-quarter will be the bottom, and that there will be improvement in the third and fourth quarter, even if there are double-digit declines,\u201d she said. \u201cInvestors are hopeful that 2021 is going to be a heck of a lot better than 2020.\u201d Overall, more than 3 million coronavirus cases have been confirmed in the U.S. along with at least 131,857 deaths, the largest national toll in the world. Texas and Florida have become the epicenters of the recent resurgence, with Florida reporting 7,361 cases on Tuesday and Texas recording more than 10,000 infections\u2014the highest one-day increase in infections thus far. Since early May, growing optimism around the U.S. economic restart had been driving a rotation into more cyclical stocks, mainly with an eye toward which companies could benefit from an easing of strict lockdowns: the \u201creopening\u201d or \u201creturn to work\u201d trade. \u201cThat trade has really unwound here,\u201d said Katie Nixon, Northern Trust Wealth Management\u2019s chief investment officer, in an interview. \u201cInvestors are getting back to the tried and true stocks that will be supported by a prolonged working-from-home environment.\u201d Nixon pointed to the outperformance of tech-powerhouseInvesco QQQ Trust QQQ, +1.52%, one of the oldest and most liquid exchange-traded funds, as well as shares of Facebook Inc. FB, +0.26%, Amazon. com Inc. AMZ, +1.47%, Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.74%, Netlfix Inc. NFLX, +1.43% and Google GOOG, +1.97% GOOGL, +1.82% parent Alphabet as examples. Read: Slack, Microsoft, Zoom are upping the ante in virtual meeting wars The broader market, with the exception of the technology-laden Nasdaq, has traded in a relatively tight range since a recent peak on June 8 for the S&P 500 index and the Dow, as stalled business reopenings threaten the prospects of a V-shaped, or quick and sharp, recovery from a deep recession, barring a vaccine or effective treatments of the deadly illness. Away from Wall Street, consumer credit dropped 5.3% on an annual basis in May, after plunging 20% in April during the height of the coronvirus, signaling that U.S. households have been less willing to borrow to make purchases than in the past.
