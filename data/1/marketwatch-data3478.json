Or a proven leader who created the greatest economy in the world?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe choice is clear: To bring America all the way back, we need four more years of President Donald Trump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the vice president said. In a reference to the unrest sparked by recent police killings of Black Americans, Pence said people \u00e2\u0080\u009cdon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to choose between supporting law enforcement and standing with our African-American neighbors,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but then claimed that Biden would cut funding for law enforcement and \u00e2\u0080\u009cdouble down on the very policies that are leading to violence in America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cities.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe hard truth is you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be safe in Joe Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s America,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pence said.

The president on Thursday night \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill be trumpeting his accomplishments\u00e2\u0080\u009d and talking about what he would do in a second term if the Trump-Pence ticket wins re-election in November, according to a campaign spokesman.

Trump and Pence have responded with incompetence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Among the other speakers at the GOP event on Wednesday night were Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, who plans to step down from her White House job by the end of the month, as well as former Notre Dame football coach Lou Holtz, South Dakota Gov.
