The CDC\u2019s new guidelines, called Considerations for Daily Life and Considerations for Events and Gatherings, recommend that people continue to maintain a distance of 6 feet from others whenever possible, wear face coverings in public, and wash their hands. The new guidelines also provide specific recommendations for visiting libraries, hotels, banks, nail salons, gyms, restaurants and bars, and attending gatherings at someone\u2019s home or in public spaces, and cite questions that individuals should ask themselves before they engage with others, in these spaces.

The CDC now says yes Some of the recommendations include: providing single-serve options or putting one person in charge of serving items like salad dressings and condiments at home gatherings, relying on online banking or ATMs when possible, sitting outside at restaurants, booking manicures or pedicures in advance to alleviate waiting times in shared spaces, and taking the stairs rather than an elevator at a hotel. \u201cWe recognize we\u2019re all getting tired of staying home,\u201d Dr. Jay Butler, the CDC\u2019s deputy director for infectious diseases, said during the call on Friday.

The CDC first told Americans to wear face coverings in early April, and the World Health Organization on June 5 updated its own mask-wearing guidance to recommend that governments encourage masks among the public in areas whether there is both widespread transmission of the virus and social-distancing challenges, such as on public transportation.

Before then, the federal agency conducted calls with journalists sometimes several times a week starting at the end of January when concerns began mounting about the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. At least two million people in the U.S. have tested positive for the virus, and more than 114,000 have died, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. In recent weeks, parts of the country have began reopening their economies, allowing Americans to go to the beach, shop at certain retailers, and some to return to work."}]}
