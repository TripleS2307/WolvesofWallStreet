(Photo: UI Public Affairs: Fred Zwicky) Over the roughly week and a half that Ian Katsnelson has been back at his college, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, the junior has developed a \u00e2\u0080\u009cmini competition\u00e2\u0080\u009d with his friends to see who can finish the process of taking their COVID-19 tests the fastest.\u00c2 \u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe hardest part for sure is garnering enough saliva,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Katsnelson said of the rapid saliva test, which was created by scientists at the school. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perfecting his strategy for his trips to the tents where testing takes place: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve built up my saliva in line before I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve even gotten inside the tent, so I can get in and get out real quick.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2 Hallie Workman, a PhD candidate in communications at U of I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of scouting that goes on\u00e2\u0080\u009d as students try to find out which of the more than a dozen testing tents on campus have the shortest line.\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have my tent in my time of day that always works well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Workman, 30, said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou just sit there trying not to make eye contact with people as you dribble spit into a tube.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2 These were just some of the rituals that marked an unusual first week of classes at the University of Illinois, which is requiring students, faculty and staff accessing campus to get tested for COVID-19 twice a week as part of its reopening plan.\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u0098A defining moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for the school As colleges across the country have sent students home or back to remote classes amid COVID outbreaks, officials at the University of Illinois are hopeful that their approach to mitigating the pandemic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spread on campus \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which includes a test developed at the school that is now being performed under the Federal Drug Administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s emergency use authorization \u00e2\u0080\u0094 will be enough to keep students in some in-person classes through November.\u00c2 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a small undertaking. The school had 51,000 students in the fall of 2019. Since July 6, the school has processed 121,333 COVID tests and in the five days leading up to Friday, which marked the end of the first week of classes, the school administered 47,075 tests and had a 0.75% positivity rate. For context, there were roughly 730,000 COVID tests administered in the entire U.S. on a recent August day, according to Johns Hopkins University\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Coronavirus Resource Center. On Aug. 24, U of I administered more than 17,000 tests alone.\u00c2 So far, the number of positive cases is in line with what the school\u00e2\u0080\u0099s modelers predicted \u00e2\u0080\u0094 well under 400 cases in the week before classes began. The next couple of weeks will be a \u00e2\u0080\u009cdefining moment\u00e2\u0080\u009d for U of I as it works to prevent the spread of COVID-19 on campus and in the community, said Robert Jones, the school\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chancellor.\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe know that people are watching,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told MarketWatch. And indeed, according to Joshua Salomon, the director of the Prevention Policy Modeling Lab at Stanford University, \u00e2\u0080\u009cpeople are really going to be watching this carefully,\u00e2\u0080\u009d describing the efforts the school has taken as \u00e2\u0080\u009cencouraging.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2 \u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to succeed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat we do know is that the likelihood of succeeding without testing is very small.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2 U of I is likely the only university testing students at this frequency At many universities that have reopened their campuses for in-person instruction, students may have been tested upon reentry to university housing or campus more broadly and may be subject to random screening. But models from researchers at Yale School of Public Health and U of I, indicate that in order to prevent an outbreak on a college campus \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and not just monitor one \u00e2\u0080\u0094 students and those interacting with them regularly need to be tested multiple times per week.\u00c2 U of I may be the only university in the country hewing to that standard. Officials will know around Sept. 25, one month and one day after the start of classes, if their efforts have worked, said Rebecca Lee Smith, an associate professor of pathobiology at U of I who is part of the team that developed the school\u00e2\u0080\u0099s testing and other protocols.\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be keeping track of how well we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing going from test results to isolation to contact tracing and quarantine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Smith said. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll also be looking out for new positive cases, a sign of community spread. The outcome that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re hoping for \u00e2\u0080\u009cis to minimize the infections, get it under control and to protect the health of campus and the community,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Smith said.\u00c2 The school began working to prepare for the fall semester shortly after classes went remote in the spring, said Martin Burke, a chemistry professor at the University of Illinois and chair of the SHIELD committee, the team that is guiding the university\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approach to reopening. They realized relatively quickly that in order to bring students back to campus, they would need to test frequently and get results back rapidly, something that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to be possible with a nasal swab test.\u00c2 University of Illinois scientists developed their own saliva test for COVID-19. (Photo: UI Public Affairs: Fred Zwicky) That led to what Burke described as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cManhattan Project-style effort,\u00e2\u0080\u009d at the university\u00c2 to develop their own test. Ultimately they were able to do so in about six weeks, he said. Now the school is working to expand access to the test to the rest of the state of Illinois and even to other areas of the country and around the world.\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cTesting is not a silver bullet, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very powerful component,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Burke said.\u00c2 In addition to the testing, the school developed an app where students, faculty and staff receive test results and reminders, and a boarding pass-style image indicating a negative COVID test that allow them access to campus buildings. Users can also enable the app to notify them when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been in close proximity to someone who tested positive for COVID through the use of an anonymized Bluetooth scanning system.\u00c2 U of I is also taking many of the same steps as other campuses\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 moving large lecture courses online, moving smaller in-person courses to large rooms to allow for social distancing and requiring masks. The school also has \u00e2\u0080\u009cevery high expectation\u00e2\u0080\u009d of students, Jones said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy agreeing to come back and be here that they have to take ownership to keep themselves safe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Those who are participating in on-campus activities and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t follow testing and isolation guidelines could be subject to student discipline.\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u0098We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still very much in the middle of a raging pandemic\u00e2\u0080\u0099 For a university to have a shot at reopening successfully, it needs to hold classes online or outside when possible, have a good system for testing and contact tracing, and have clear and transparent metrics for when it will change course, Salomon said. (Asked about what would trigger a move to remote instruction, Jones said \u00e2\u0080\u009cone of the key metrics, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re keeping our eye on is the number of positive cases.\u00e2\u0080\u009d) All of these are costly and administratively challenging undertakings. Jones said his best \u00e2\u0080\u009cguesstimate\u00e2\u0080\u009d is that the school\u00e2\u0080\u0099s testing component alone will cost $7 to $10 million per semester. But a major obstacle to any successful reopening, is just the status of the spread of the virus itself, Salomon said.\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still very much in the middle of a raging pandemic,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith that amount of transmission in communities and bringing together students from around the country, we know that there will be people infected upon arrival. It raises the bar on what needs to be done to interrupt transmission and cut it off.\u00e2\u0080\u009dCalled an audible and held class on Zoom During the first week of classes, when the school onboarded tens of thousands of students, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe main hiccup\u00e2\u0080\u009d in its system was turning test results around fast enough so that students, faculty and staff would have access to buildings they needed to be in for class, Smith said. Those who haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t had a negative test result in the last four days can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get into university buildings, except their own residence hall. Still, the school has been turning test results around \u00e2\u0080\u009cwell within\u00e2\u0080\u009d the 48 hour window they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve promised, she said.\u00c2 Workman was one of those affected by the hiccup. She got tested on a Monday, which was one of the testing days assigned to her by the school, but didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get her results back in time to teach her 8 a.m. Tuesday class in person. She \u00e2\u0080\u009chad to call an audible and tell my class we were meeting on Zoom.\u00e2\u0080\u009d When the two public speaking classes she was teaching started last week, roughly 5% of her students couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t attend because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d tested positive for the virus, Workman said. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one metric Workman said she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be keeping an eye on as she evaluates whether to keep teaching in person. If enough students can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t attend class face-to-face because of quarantine or isolation, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll transition to remote instruction, though her preference is to continue teaching in-person classes \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the widespread testing has made her feel comfortable doing so.\u00c2 Owen Stephenson was eager to come to campus for his freshman year to gain some independence, even if he would be taking most of his classes online. So far, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s felt like the testing has gone smoothly; he received his first two test results on the same day he tested and his only quibble was a 45-minute wait on a weekend, when there are fewer testing tents available.\u00c2 The required testing is part of what makes Stephenson feel like he can keep himself safe, regardless of other students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 behavior. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTheir testing is the only thing that sets them apart from other universities trying to go back,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said of U of I\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plan.\u00c2 From her observations in class, Workman said it seems as if students are committed to making the school\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reopening program work because they want to stick around for the semester. Still, she said, the changes to the college experience required during this time \u00e2\u0080\u0094 more rules for engaging on campus, more online courses than typical \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have left her students so drained that she ended a recent class 20 minutes early.\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey had this feeling that once they were finally able to get back on campus, that life would feel more normal and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}]}
