That is Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co., offering his view on the outlook for the economy in amid the continuing coronavirus pandemic. Speaking to MSNBC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Stephanie Ruhle in an interview that aired on Tuesday, the billionaire CEO of the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest bank by market value forecast a tough road ahead for recovery from the recession that Americans currently find themselves mired in. The bank boss noted that that the pandemic and the government and central-bank response to it have created a disconnect between the real economy and the stock market, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% rising on Tuesday and the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% within a stone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s throw of its record high and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.39% having produced 32 record highs already in 2020. Meanwhile, millions of people are out of work as the spread of the disease has forced an extension, and sometimes a reimposition, of business closures intended to limit the contagion, while lawmakers have failed to agree upon additional stimulus for those out-of-work Americans after relief measures expired at the end of last month. Dimon said that the public health crisis would eventually impact incomes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be doing this a year from now and think that it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cause devastation in the economy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said of talks from lawmakers about providing a fresh round of assistance to individuals. Dimon said that the pandemic created by the spread of the novel coronavirus is likely to have lasting effects well into the future, as consumers remain skittish about returning to and achieving some semblance of normalcy in the near term. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be some scar tissue from this one, but we have a chance to recover,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the CEO said. In a separate interview with CNN, Dimon said that he was encouraged by some signs that the viral spread was slowing in some states and hopeful that the U.S. would eventually get the disease under control. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will win that war,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the J.P. Morgan Chase JPM, -0.57% head told CNN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief business correspondent, Christine Romans, recently, predicting that the U.S. unemployment rate would fall to around or below 7% by next year. Dimon is making the media rounds as he joins an initiative to work with institutions and nonprofits to hire people from marginalized communities, including Blacks, in the wake of heightened sensitive around racial injustice following the killing of George Floyd back in May. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe pace is quick, the world has become more complex, and these problems of education, and jobs, infrastructure, immigration \u00e2\u0080\u0094 if you fixed these things we will have a far more just society,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dimon said."}]}
