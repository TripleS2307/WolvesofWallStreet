Wirecard said it is having \u201cconstructive discussions\u201d with its lenders about its credit lines, is considering cost cuts and the disposal of business units and product segments. Another mover was Deutsche Lufthansa LHA, -1.71%, down 6% as its top shareholder, Heinz Hermann Thiele, fights a bailout package.
