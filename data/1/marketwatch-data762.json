(Getty Images) House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin took another swing at negotiating a deal for a second major coronavirus bill this year, but agreed only to talk again Thursday. The talks Wednesday, the first in-person discussions in weeks between the House\u2019s top Democrat and the Trump administration\u2019s highest-profile bargainer, came as lawmakers look to leave Washington soon. \u201cIf there\u2019s a fair compromise, we\u2019re prepared to do it,\u201d Mnuchin said in an interview on Fox Business News late Wednesday. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to make significant progress until tomorrow, at this point.\u201d Mnuchin spent about 90 minutes in Pelosi\u2019s office Wednesday, after spending about 50 minutes on the phone with her Tuesday. Pelosi issued a terse statement after the meeting with Mnuchin. \u201cToday, Secretary Mnuchin and I had an extensive conversation and we found areas where we are seeking further clarification. Our conversations will continue,\u201d she said. Still, Mnuchin\u2019s offer came as House Democrats were setting up a vote on a slimmed-down version of their original, sweeping $3.4 trillion coronavirus bill that passed in May, which Republicans derided as too expensive. However, the passage of the new $2.2 trillion bill is seen widely as the likely informal end of talks because it would give Democrats another stimulus vote in Congress they could point out to voters as they hit the election campaign trail, even though the bill would die in the Senate. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do a $2.2 trillion deal,\u201d Mnuchin said. He said President Donald Trump had instructed negotiators to raise their offer \u201csignificantly\u201d and the administration was now looking to offer a package \u201cin the neighborhood\u201d between $1.5 trillion and House Democrats\u2019 $2.2 trillion top line. After first saying they would vote on the new bill late Wednesday, House Democrats reversed course and put off the vote until Thursday, giving negotiators more time. This week is scheduled to be the last in Washington for House members until after the November election, and possibly the last one for members of the Senate, except for a return to vote on a Supreme Court nominee. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said he had told House members to keep their schedules flexible and he also told reporters a vote on what Democrats call the \u201cHeroes 2\u201d bill would not necessarily mean the end of negotiations. The talks come as extra money on top of state jobless benefits has begun to run out and businesses have exhausted the loans extended under the Paycheck Protection Program. Another program to help airlines retain workers expires Wednesday, leaving airlines to say they will have to furlough workers unless it is renewed. All three programs were part of the CARES Act passed in March. \u201cTomorrow, tens of thousands of airline workers will be furloughed if the program is not extended,\u201d said Nicholas Calio, president and CEO of lobbying group Airlines for America.

After meeting with his fellow Republicans, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday the idea his colleagues would approve a $2.2 trillion deal was \u201coutlandish.\u201d McConnell\u2019s top lieutenant, Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, said it was unclear a package bigger than the approximately $650 billion one Senate Republicans voted for at the beginning of September could pass there. \u201cCould you pass it? Maybe. But you\u2019re going to pass it with 47 democrats and 13 republicans and that\u2019s \u2014 depending on what that number is, I don\u2019t know where the 13 Republicans would come from,\u201d he said. To overcome a filibuster threat, a package would need 60 votes in the Senate, and Democrats control only 47."}]}
