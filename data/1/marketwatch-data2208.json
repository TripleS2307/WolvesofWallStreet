Doctorswere highly critical of President Donald Trump's decision to drive by supporters in a motorcade from Walter Reed hospital on Sunday evening. James Phillips, doctor of emergency medicine at George Washington University, who is also an attending physician at Walter Reed, tweeted his dismay. \"Every single person in the vehicle during that completely unnecessary Presidential 'drive-by' just now has to be quarantined for 14 days,\" he said. \"They might get sick. They may die.\" Phillips said, \"For political theater. Commanded by Trump to put their lives at risk for theater. This is insanity.\" Brazil has the second-highest death toll after the U.S. at 146,352, but third-highest case tally at 4.9 million. India is second to the U.S. by case tally at 6.6 million, and has the third-highest death toll at 102,685. Mexico is fourth with 79,088 deaths and ninth with 761,665 cases.
