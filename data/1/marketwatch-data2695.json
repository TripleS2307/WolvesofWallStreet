Gains in Apple AAPL, +1.74% , Walmart WMT, +1.00% , Zoom Video ZM, +2.89% , Amazon.com AMZN, +3.01% and Facebook Inc. FB, +0.26% underscored that theme Tuesday, with shares in those popular plays carving out fresh gains in the new month. \u201cI prefer to call them stay-at-home stocks, because really they are the COVID winners,\u201d said Stephen Dover, head of equities at Franklin Templeton, in an interview with MarketWatch. \u201cThose are all beating the reopening stocks, including the airlines,\u201d he said, pointing to the recent decision by major carriers to drop their fees on most tickets changes for domestic flights. \u201cIn essence, they can take that straight off their bottom line,\u201d Dover said. U.S. stocks initially got off to a choppy start Tuesday, but gained steam throughout the session, including after Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard said the central bank should \u201cpivot\u201d to provide more support for U.S. economic growth, presumably meaning the Fed could purchase more assets, such as U.S. Treasurys or privately issued debt.

Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, said Tuesday that Senate Republicans are aiming to unveil a new, targeted coronavirus aid bill next week once lawmakers return from a break, echoing comments from Sen.
