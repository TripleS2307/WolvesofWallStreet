Trump said the damage to the U.S. economy during the pandemic can be blamed on China, where the illness was first reported late last year. Biden responded by using an expression used by Trump in a recent Axios interview regarding the U.S. death toll: \u201cIt is what it is because you are who you are,\u201d Biden said. The debate came on a day with more than 43,000 new COVID-19 cases in the U.S. and 918 deaths, according to a New York Times tracker. In the last week, the U.S. has counted an average of 43,128 cases a day, up 13% from the average two weeks ago. The U.S. has the most cases and deaths of any country in the world at 7.2 million cases and 206,351 fatalities, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. That\u2019s about a fifth of the global death toll. Experts have lamented the U.S. government\u2019s handling of the crisis and failure to follow a consistent strategy on testing, contact tracing and isolation, and convince the public of the need to socially distance and wear face masks. A group of seven former U.S. Food and Drug Administration commissioners added their voices to the chorus on Wednesday in an op-ed in the Washington Post, in which they warned that political interference from Trump administration officials is undermining the credibility of the country\u2019s leading public health agencies. That, in turn, could have dire consequences for the development and rollout of a coronavirus vaccine, said the op-ed, which was written by Robert Califf, Scott Gottlieb, Margaret Hamburg, Jane Henney, David Kessler, Mark McClellan and Andy von Eschenbach. \u201cFor decades, when we and our predecessors spoke as FDA commissioners about issues of regulation and people\u2019s health, the public knew we were speaking on behalf of experts whose judgments were grounded in science,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThat is changing in deeply troubling ways.\u201d The group cited as examples statements from the White House that it may try to influence scientific standards for vaccine development followed by the FDA, or even prevent it from issuing further written guidance, despite key leaders of the FDA, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Institutes of Health supporting the guidance. Then there was the move by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar to remove the FDA\u2019s authority to establish rules for food and drug safety, and make himself the sole authority. \u201cThis came in the wake of acknowledged acts of political influence on the FDA\u2019s coronavirus communications, significant misstatements by the secretary and other political leaders about the benefits of hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma, and the overruling of FDA scientists on the regulation of covid-19 laboratory tests. At risk is the FDA\u2019s ability to make the independent, science-based decisions that are key to combating the pandemic and so much more,\u201d the doctors wrote. Polls consistently show that Americans are turning away from science as the number willing to take a vaccine is declining. A recent Pew Research Center report found 78% of those surveyed were concerned that the approval process will be rushed. Just 21% of those polled said they would definitely take a vaccine, or about half the percentage that said that just four months ago. Read:Trump, Xi and Putin are least trusted leaders during pandemic; Merkel is most trusted \u201cIf the FDA makes available a safe and effective vaccine that people trust, we could expect to meaningfully reduce Covid-19 risk as soon as next spring or summer. Without that trust, our health and economy could lag for years,\u201d the commissioners wrote.

The latest data showed the city\u2019s positivity rate rose to 3.25% on Sunday, doubling from the 1.41% recorded the previous day.

Economists surveyed by MarketWatch expect job growth this month to moderate to 800,000 from 1.37 million in August. The jobless rate has fallen to 8.4% in August from nearly 15% in April. But the pace of improvement has slowed in recent month and jobless claims have remained elevated. Economists also note that ADP has undershot the government\u2019s first estimate of job growth in each of the past five months. Separately, a record decline in the U.S. economy in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic was lowered slightly to a 31.4% annual pace \u2014 setting the stage for a big rebound in the third quarter, MarketWatch\u2019s Jeffry Bartash reported.

Finally, a measure of business conditions in the Chicago region surged in September to the highest level since the end of 2018. The Chicago PMI business barometer jumped to 62.4 in September from 51.2 in the prior month, MNI Indicators said Wednesday. Any reading above 50 indicates improving conditions. Wall Street had expected a reading of 52. The Chicago PMI report came out early before its normal 9:45 a.m. Eastern release time. \u201cManufacturing is still rising from low levels, but momentum has slowed in recent months,\u201d said Rubeela Farooqi, Chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% was last up 1.3% and the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% was up 0.9%. Don\u2019t miss:Temporary layoffs are becoming permanent job lossesWhat are companies saying? \u2022 Dow Inc. DOW, -0.04% expects to book restructuring charges of $500 million to $600 million in the third quarter, as the materials science company, which makes plastics and paints among other products, pushes ahead with a cost cutting program during the pandemic. The company said the charges will consist of severance and related benefit costs, exit and disposal activity costs and asset write-downs and write-offs. The company is on track to achieve its reduced target for capex of $1.25 billion in 2020, down from $2.0 billion in 2019. \u201cGiven the expected gradual and uneven global economic recovery from COVID-19, we announced in July that we are taking necessary actions to continue to optimize our asset footprint, reduce structural costs and enhance the competitiveness of our business over the long-term,\u201d Chief Executive Jim Fitterling said in a statement. The company is expecting to close the sale of rail infrastructure assets at six North American sites to Watco three months earlier than planned for cash proceeds or more than $310 million. \u2022 Elanco Animal Health Inc. ELAN, +3.01% is restructuring its business just two months after closing the acquisition of Bayer Animal Health. The Greenfield, Indiana-based company expects to cut 900 jobs across nearly 40 countries, mostly in sales and marketing, but also in R&D, manufacturing and quality, and back office support. The company is aiming to generate at least $100 million in annual savings, and will start to de-lever, by paying $100 million on its term loan. Elanco is aiming to capture initial synergies from the deal, despite the challenges presented by the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cAfter our early view of the combined business, we have full confidence in delivering $275 million to $300 million in synergies, with the first two-thirds coming in the first 30 months,\u201d Chief Executive Jeff Simmons said in a statement. The restructuring is expected to cost $190 million to $210 million, and the company will book a restructuring charge of $130 million to $145 million in the third quarter, followed by $40 million to $45 million in the fourth quarter. \u2022 Oasis Petroleum Inc. OAS, -8.55% is filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy with a prepackaged plan with creditors, aiming to reduce its debt by $1.8 billion. The company is the latest energy company to collapse beneath the weight of a weak oil price and constrained demand during the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cIn light of a volatile market environment that drove a severe downturn in oil and gas prices, as well as the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Oasis Petroleum engaged with its lenders and an ad hoc committee of noteholders regarding restructuring alternatives to reduce debt, increase financial flexibility and position the business for long-term success,\u201d the company said in a statement. Oasis has secured a $450 million debtor-in-possession loan and has sufficient liquidity to maintain operations.

The massive job reduction was the most eye-opening among several severe cost-cutting measures made by Disney, which has lost billions of dollars in potential revenue because of suspended operations at its amusement parks, live-production units and cruise lines since COVID-19-imposed closures dating back to March. Disney said in its most recent earnings report that COVID-19 had cost its theme-park business roughly $1 billion in operating income in its fiscal second quarter."}]}
