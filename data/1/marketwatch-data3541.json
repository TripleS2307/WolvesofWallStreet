Andrew Cuomo on restarting NYC schools", "body": "New York City schools will reopen in a limited way in September, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced in his daily news conference on Thursday. But just a few hours later, Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s office sent out a statement calling the reopening announcement \u201cpremature.\u201d Of the 450,000 families who responded to a citywide survey, 75% wanted to send their children back to school in September, said the mayor as part of an announcement that classes will resume with requirements for masks, regular deep cleanings, hand washing and hand sanitizing stations, and staggered schedules that allow for smaller class sizes and social distancing. \u201cWe\u2019re full steam ahead for September,\u201d de Blasio said. With the goal \u201cto have the maximum number of kids in our schools as we begin.\u201d Later in the day, however, the governor\u2019s communications director Dani Lever sent out a statement, saying only the state had the power to reopen New York City schools and no decision had been made yet.

And: Almost 1.2 million babies could die during the pandemic \u2014 but not from the coronavirus School districts should have plans in place \u201cfor \u2018the new normal\u2019\u201d if it is indeed deemed safe for schools to open in the fall, and the governor \u201chopes\u201d schools will be able to reopen but won\u2019t make a formal decision on the matter until \u201cmore current information\u201d is available, Lever said. \u201cWe value the opinion of local politicians and the state\u2019s 700 local school districts as to what should be done,\u201d Lever said, \u201cbut the public should not be confused on this important decision that has practical consequences for many.\u201d The back-and-forth between the mayor and governor\u2019s offices on school closures was a source of both tension and confusion in March, when Cuomo and de Blasio issued conflicting statements on the immediate future of the city\u2019s 1.1 million public school students. The city\u2019s education department will send formal reopening plans to the state for approval over the summer, said Schools Chancellor Richard Carranza at de Blasio\u2019s briefing on Thursday. Current reopening plans may also face pushback from working parents who are unable to home-school their children during the staggered weeks they\u2019re not at school. The city\u2019s teacher\u2019s union could raise objections, as well. Also read: Even with reopening, New York still faces a future that looks very different \u201cSchools will reopen in the fall \u2014 even on a limited basis \u2014 only when the safety of students, parents and staff is assured,\u201d said United Federation of Teachers President Michael Mulgrew in an email to MarketWatch. Mulgrew has previously written that a large influx of federal funding would be required for New York City schools to open with adequate safety measures in place. As COVID-19 cases continue to spike across the U.S., numbers in New York remain low, according to an update sent out by the governor\u2019s office on Thursday. Ten deaths from the virus were recorded statewide on Wednesday, and out of 69,945 tests conducted, just 1.25% came back positive. In New York City, the rate of positive tests was slightly higher, at 1.3%, a slight increase than the 1% and 1.1% positive cases registered on Monday and Tuesday, respectively, citywide. There were 875 new positive cases statewide Wednesday, the fourth straight day numbers rose. On Monday there were 524 cases, and 624 on Tuesday."}]}
