Businesses, governments and other organizations hired 5.9 million people in August, according to a Labor Department survey of the labor market that\u2019s released with a one-month delay. The number of people hired was basically unchanged from July, but the total was inflated by the addition of nearly 250,000 temporary workers hired by the U.S. Census for its once-in-a-decade national survey. Hiring in the private sector declined. Job openings also slipped to 6.49 million from 6.7 million. The number of jobs available was running around 7 million a month before the coronavirus struck in March. The number of separations \u2014 layoffs, firings, people quitting \u2014 fell to 4.59 million in August from 4.99 million in July. At the peak of the pandemic in March and April, the U.S. lost more than 24 million jobs. So far it\u2019s only recovered about half of them back.

Yet hotels, restaurants and health-care providers \u2014 industries hard hit by the pandemic \u2014 hired far fewer people in August than they did in July. Job openings declined in most industries across the country. The share of people who left jobs on their own, known as the quits rate, fell to 2.2% from 2.4% among private-sector employees. It\u2019s a full percentage point lower compared to a year ago; fewer people are willing quit a secure job during a recession. See:Marketwatch\u2019s Coronavirus Economic Recovery Tracker The big picture: Millions of people returned to their jobs after the economy reopened in May, but millions more are still without work and have little prospect of finding any. Many businesses in travel, tourism, retail and other service-oriented industries have suffered a massive loss of customers who are unlikely to return until the pandemic fades or a treatment is found. As a result, the pace of hiring has slowed and further gains in employment are likely to be harder to come by. What could make the situation worse is if a second wave of layoffs strikes the economy. Some industries badly damaged by the coronavirus, such as airlines and hotels, have said they plan to turn temporary furloughs into permanent job losses unless they get more government aid.

This is a sign that while labor demand held up more than we may have expected early in the recovery, that pace is not guaranteed to continue,\u201d said Nick Bunker, director of research at Indeed Hiring Lab. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, the prospects for unemployed workers permanently separated from their job finding a new one may dim,\u201d he added.
