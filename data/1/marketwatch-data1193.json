The White House worked furiously to block the book, asking a federal court for an emergency temporary restraining order Wednesday against its release. See:Trump asked China\u2019s Xi to buy U.S. farm products to help him win re-election, Bolton book says Bolton\u2019s allegations that Trump solicited Chinese help for his reelection effort carried echoes of Trump\u2019s attempt to get political help from Ukraine, which led to his impeachment. \u201cI am hard-pressed to identify any significant Trump decision during my tenure that wasn\u2019t driven by re-election calculations,\u201d Bolton wrote. The 577-page book paints an unvarnished portrait of Trump and his administration, amounting to the most vivid, first-person account yet of how Trump conducts himself in office. Several other former officials have written books, but most have been flattering about the president. Other former officials have indicated they were saving their accounts of their time working for Trump until after he left office in order to speak more candidly. The Associated Press obtained a copy of Bolton\u2019s book in advance of its release next week. Bolton, Trump\u2019s national security adviser for a 17-month period, called Trump\u2019s attempt to shift the June 2019 conversation with Xi to the U.S. election a stunning move, and wrote that it was among innumerable conversations that he found concerning. He added that Congress should have expanded the scope of its impeachment inquiry to these other incidents. Deeply critical of the president and much of his senior team, Bolton wrote that because staff had served him so poorly, Trump \u201csaw conspiracies behind rocks, and remained stunningly uninformed on how to run the White House, let alone the huge federal government.\u201d He added that while he was at the White House, Trump typically had only two intelligence briefings a week \u201cand in most of those, he spoke at greater length than the briefers, often on matters completely unrelated to the subjects at hand.\u201d Trump was asked about the book Wednesday on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cHannity.\u201d He turned to personal insults, calling Bolton a \u201cwashed-up guy. I gave him a chance.\u201d He also took issue with copies of the book being released. \u201cHe broke the law. Very simple. I mean, as much as it\u2019s going to be broken.\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s highly classified information and he did not have approval.\u201d The book also includes embarrassing claims that Trump thought Finland was part of Russia, didn\u2019t know that the United Kingdom was a nuclear power and called reporters \u201cscumbags\u201d who should be \u201cexecuted.\u201d As for the meeting with the Chinese president in Osaka, Japan, Bolton wrote that Trump told Xi that Democrats were hostile to China. \u201cHe then, stunningly, turned the conversation to the coming U.S. presidential election, alluding to China\u2019s economic capability to affect the ongoing campaigns, pleading with Xi to ensure he\u2019d win,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cHe stressed the importance of farmers, and increased Chinese purchases of soybeans and wheat in the electoral outcome.\u201d Bolton wrote that he would print Trump\u2019s exact words, \u201cbut the government\u2019s pre-publication review process has decided otherwise.\u201d The book, titled \u201cThe Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir,\u201d is set to be released Tuesday by Simon & Schuster. It has been the subject of a lengthy battle between Bolton and the White House. The Justice Department filed suit Tuesday in an effort to delay publication of the book, claiming it still contained highly classified information and that a required review by the National Security Council had not been concluded. According to the filing, a career official determined no classified material remained in April, but national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien initiated a secondary review that deemed additional information to be classified. The White House\u2019s contention that so much of the book was classified appeared to be a tacit admission that many of Bolton\u2019s allegations were accurate \u2014 as inaccurate information could not be classified. Bolton wrote that, due to the review process, he made \u201cnumerous changes to the manuscript in order to obtain clearance to publish, the vast bulk of which, in my view, did not change the facts set forth.\u201d He said in some cases he was asked to add phrases like, \u201cin my view,\u201d to make it clear he was expressing his opinion instead of relying on sensitive information. In others, he was asked to describe things more generally. He was asked to remove quotation marks nearly every time he recounts conversation between Trump and foreign leaders and himself and foreign leaders. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said Wednesday that he attended a meeting between Trump and Xi at the Group of 20 nations in Osaka, but he never heard Trump pleading with Xi to buy more agriculture products to ensure he would win reelection. Lighthizer spoke at a Senate hearing on trade issues and was asked about Bolton\u2019s recollection of events. \u201cAbsolutely untrue. Never happened. I was there. I have no recollection of that ever happening. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s true. I don\u2019t believe it ever happened,\u201d Lighthizer said. \u201cWould I recollect something as crazy as that? Of course, I would recollect it.\u201d Bolton wrote that he raised some of his concerns about Trump\u2019s conversations with foreign leaders with Attorney General William Barr, and flagged similar worries with White House attorneys and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. \u201cThe pattern looked like obstruction of justice as a way of life, which we couldn\u2019t accept,\u201d he wrote. Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec denied in a statement that Barr had ever expressed that Trump\u2019s conversations with foreign leaders were improper. Trump continually pandered to Xi, Bolton wrote. At a White House Christmas dinner in 2018, Bolton said Trump asked why the U.S. was sanctioning China over its treatment of Uighurs. China suspects Uighurs, who are predominantly Muslim and culturally and ethnically distinct from the majority Han Chinese population, of harboring separatist tendencies. In recent years, China has dramatically escalated its campaign against them by detaining more than 1 million people in internment camps and prisons, which it calls vocational training centers. \u201cAt the opening dinner of the Osaka G-20 meeting, with only interpreters present, Xi explained to Trump why he was basically building concentration camps in Xinjiang,\u201d Bolton wrote. \u201cAccording to our interpreter, Trump said that Xi should go ahead with building the camps, which he thought was exactly the right thing to do. \u201c Bolton\u2019s claim that Trump was appealing to China to assist his reelection effort comes as the president\u2019s rhetoric toward the U.S. geopolitical rival has grown more acerbic in response to the coronavirus pandemic. But it may undercut the Trump reelection campaign\u2019s efforts, evidenced in recent television ads and public statements to paint presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden as soft on China. In the book, Bolton describes every Trump decision as being guided by concerns for his own reelection, a claim that evokes the scandal that sparked Trump\u2019s impeachment last year. The book alleges that Trump directly tied providing military aid to Ukraine to the country\u2019s willingness to conduct investigations into the Bidens. In one conversation, Trump said \u201che wasn\u2019t in favor of sending them anything until all the Russia-investigation materials related to Clinton and Biden had been turned over,\u201d Bolton writes. Trump\u2019s decision to withhold military assistance to Ukraine until it agreed to investigate Biden led the House to charge Trump was abusing his power. The aid was ultimately released once the hold-up became public. The GOP-controlled Senate ultimately acquitted the president on that count and a count of obstructing Congress\u2019 investigation of the incident. Bolton was called to testify before House lawmakers conducting the impeachment inquiry, but he declined, suggesting he wanted a federal court to decide whether he should heed a White House directive not to cooperate with the inquiry. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the specifics in Bolton\u2019s book, but emailed reporters past quotes of Democratic lawmakers impugning the former Trump aide\u2019s credibility. In advance of the public reports about the details, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the book was \u201cfull of classified information, which is inexcusable.\u201d"}]}
