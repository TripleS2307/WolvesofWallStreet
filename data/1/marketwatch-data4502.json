AAPL, +1.74% could face heightened antitrust scrutiny in the U.S. as the Department of Justice and state attorneys general are looking at an investigation that would focus on the company's App Store, according to a Politico report. European regulators also have investigations underway that look into Apple's App Store and Apple Pay practices. Apple takes a cut of revenue when users make in-app purchases of digital services through third-party apps, which some developers have criticized as anticompetitive and arbitrary. The European investigation of Apple Pay will examine Apple's control over the NFC reader on iPhones, which enables contactless payments. The company has restricted the way third parties can tap into this technology. Apple shares are off 0.6% in premarket trading Wednesday. The stock has gained 48% over the past three months as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% has risen 26%."}]}
