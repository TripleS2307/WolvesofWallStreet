The U.K. oil producer expects revenue of around $700 million for the January-June period. This compares with $872 million revenue a year earlier. Tullow also anticipates pretax impairments of between $1.4 billion and $1.7 billion, it said. Tullow also narrowed its production guidance range for 2020 to 71,000-78,000 barrels of oil per day. First-half output was in line with expectations at 77,700 barrels, the company said. \"In the second half of 2020 our focus will remain on continuing to deliver safe and reliable production from West Africa, reducing debt and building a cost-effective and efficient organization that can compete in a low oil price environment,\" Chief Executive Rahul Dhir said.
