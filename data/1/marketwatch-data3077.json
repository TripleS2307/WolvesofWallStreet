Shares of BioNTech jumped 5.9% and Pfizer's stock gained 1.8% in premarket trading on Wednesday.

Most drugmakers including AstraZeneca AZN, +1.16% AZN, +0.63% and Moderna Inc. MRNA, +0.09% that have moved their vaccines into clinical trials in the U.S. have already established financial relationships with the U.S. government. (Pfizer chief business officer John Young responded to lawmakers by saying that the company \"didn't accept the federal government funding solely for the reason that we wanted to be able to move as quickly as possible with our vaccine candidate.\") The companies also said Wednesday they expect to launch a Phase 2b/3 clinical trial this month and aim to apply for an EUA or approval in the U.S. by October if the studies are successful. Since the start of the year, shares of BioNTech have soared 170.3%, Pfizer's stock has declined 6.3%. and the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% is down 0.2%."}]}
