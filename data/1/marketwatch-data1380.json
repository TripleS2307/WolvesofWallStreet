The latest data showed the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s positivity rate rose to 3.25% on Sunday, doubling from the 1.41% recorded the previous day. The spike has finally forced de Blasio to do something he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long opposed: ticketing people who defy the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mask mandate.\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to fine people. If we have to, we will, and that will be starting on a large scale today,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the mayor said. The spike in cases has centered on just nine of the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 146 ZIP Codes and has specifically hit close-knit Orthodox Jewish communities, said city leaders. A decision could come as soon as Wednesday if additional measures would have to be taken to stem the spread of infections. That could mean closing some nonessential businesses, again, including community institutions \u00e2\u0080\u009clike yeshivas and childcare,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and new limits on gatherings, de Blasio said.\u00c2 Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss: COVID-19 stimulus talks could still get off the ground as end of runway nears In the meantime, a raft of city agencies, including the test and trace corps and the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health department, have blanketed the hotspots, known as the \u00e2\u0080\u009cOcean Parkway cluster\u00e2\u0080\u009d in southern Brooklyn, as well as parts of Queens with ramped-up testing and information, said Mitchell Katz, president and CEO of Health + Hospitals. Agencies have reached out to religious leaders and distributed masks to more than 300 synagogues in recent days. The city has also ramped up rapid-testing capacity, deployed robocalls and sent seven sound trucks to spread the message, Katz said.\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re using every tool, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re open to suggestions of other tools,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\u00c2 The city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s single-day spike comes the same week that roughly 500,000 public school children head back to classrooms for the first time since March, and could derail in-person learning, which has already been delayed twice.\u00c2 All schools would close down again if the city hits a 3% positivity rate on a seven-day rolling average, the mayor has said \u00e2\u0080\u0094 essentially giving its leaders days to get new cases under control. The seven-day rolling average had ticked up to 1.38% on Sunday, according to the latest city data. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCan we keep it well below 3% with our actions? Yes. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m convinced we can,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said de Blasio, adding optimistically that even if there were a systemwide closure, it would \u00e2\u0080\u009cbe temporary to say the least.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gov. Andrew Cuomo will also be meeting with religious leaders from Brooklyn and two other state hotspots in Orange and Rockland counties in the coming days, he announced on Tuesday, as he harangued local governments for lax enforcement.\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cMask wearing is a state law. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a law. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not, \u00e2\u0080\u0098it would be nice if you could,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cuomo said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a law and the local governments are supposed to be enforcing the law, and they haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been \u00e2\u0080\u0094 many of them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2 The number of people testing positive for the virus statewide rose to 1.3% with another 1,189 cases confirmed, Cuomo said at his own briefing on Tuesday. In one Orange County ZIP Code, however, as many as 18% of people tested have come back positive, according to data from the state on Tuesday.\u00c2 Coronavirus update: Global case tally 33.4 million, death toll above 1 million, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likely an underestimate, says WHO expert He also reiterated that the state had the power to roll back the reopenings, whether in the city or the Hudson Valley, but said that he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel the clusters were at a point of needing to close businesses back down.\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese are embers that are starting to catch fire in dry grass,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cuomo said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSend all the firefighting equipment and personnel to those embers and stamp out the embers right away.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}]}
