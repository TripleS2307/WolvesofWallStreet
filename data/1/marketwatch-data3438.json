(AP) \u2014 Two people were shot to death and another was wounded during a third night of protests in Kenosha over the police shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake, and authorities Wednesday hunted for a possible vigilante seen on cellphone video opening fire in the middle of the street with a rifle. The gunfire was reported just before midnight, and Sheriff David Beth said one victim was shot in the head and another in the chest, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. The third victim\u2019s wounds were not believed to life-threatening.

Beth told the Journal Sentinel that armed people had been patrolling the city\u2019s streets in recent nights, but he did not know if the gunman was among them. \u201cThey\u2019re a militia,\u201d Beth said. \u201cThey\u2019re like a vigilante group.\u201d Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes told MSNBC early Wednesday that it appeared to be the case that a member of a militia group had taken the law into his own hands and, acting as a vigilante, \u201cmowed down\u201d protesters. Cellphone video of at least two of the shootings that was posted online shows what appears to be a white man with a semiautomatic rifle jogging down the middle of a street as a crowd and some police officers follow him. Someone in the crowd can be heard asking, \u201cWhat did he do?\u201d and another person responds that the man had shot someone.

Medic!\u201d A witness, Julio Rosas, 24, said that when the gunman stumbled and fell, \u201ctwo people jumped onto him and there was a struggle for control of his rifle. At that point during the struggle, he just began to fire multiple rounds and that dispersed people near him.\u201d \u201cThe rifle was being jerked around in all directions while it was being fired,\u201d Rosas said. In the cellphone footage, as the crowd scatters, the gunman stands up and continues walking down the street as police cars arrive. The man puts up his hands and walks toward the squad cars, with someone in the crowd yelling at police that the man had just shot someone, but several of the cars drive past him toward the people who had been shot. Protester Devin Scott told the Chicago Tribune that he witnessed one of the shootings. \u201cWe were all chanting, \u2018Black lives matter,\u2019 at the gas station and then we heard, boom, boom, and I told my friend, `\u2019That\u2019s not fireworks,\u2019 \u201d said Scott, 19. \u201cAnd then this guy with this huge gun runs by us in the middle of the street and people are yelling, \u2018He shot someone! He shot someone!\u2019 And everyone is trying to fight the guy, chasing him and then he started shooting again.\u201d Scott said he cradled one of the lifeless victims in his arms, and a woman started performing CPR. \u201cI don\u2019t think he made it.\u201d At a news conference earlier Tuesday, Ben Crump, the lawyer for Blake\u2019s family, said that Blake was shot multiple times by police on Sunday and that it would \u201ctake a miracle\u201d for him to walk again. He called for the officer who opened fire to be arrested and for the others involved to lose their jobs. The shooting of Blake \u2014 apparently while three of his children looked on \u2014 was captured on cellphone video and ignited new protests over racial injustice in the U.S. just three months after the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police touched off a wider reckoning on race. Kenosha police have said little about what happened, other than that they were responding to a domestic dispute. They have not said why the officers opened fire or whether Blake was armed, and they have not disclosed the race of three officers who were on the scene. The 29-year-old Blake underwent surgery Tuesday, according to Crump, who added that the bullets severed his spinal cord and shattered vertebrae. Another lawyer, Patrick Salvi II, said there was severe damage to organs. Blake\u2019s father, also named Jacob Blake, told the Chicago Sun-Times that his son had eight holes in his body. At a news conference, he said police shot his son \u201cseven times, seven times, like he didn\u2019t matter.\u201d \u201cBut my son matters. He\u2019s a human being, and he matters,\u201d the elder Blake said. Blake\u2019s mother, Julia Jackson, told CBS \u201cThis Morning\u201d in an interview that aired Wednesday that she feels as if she is in a \u201cbad dream\u201d and that it felt \u201cunreal\u201d that her son\u2019s name has been added to the list of Black people shot by police. \u201cNever in a million years did I think we would be here in this place. Him being alive is just a miracle in itself,\u201d she said. During the latest round of unrest Tuesday, police fired tear gas for the third straight night to disperse protesters who had gathered outside Kenosha\u2019s courthouse, where some shook a protective fence and threw water bottles and fireworks at officers lined up behind it. On Tuesday, before the two deadly shootings, the Kenosha County Board sent a letter to Gov. Tony Evers requesting that 1,500 National Guard members be sent to the city in addition to the 250 the first-term Democrat had already dispatched. On Monday night, crowds destroyed dozens of buildings and set more than 30 fires downtown. \u201cOur county is under attack. Our businesses are under attack. Our homes are under attack. Our local law enforcement agencies need additional support to help bring civility back to our community,\u201d the county board leaders wrote. Anger over the shooting has spilled into the streets of other cities, including Los Angeles and Minneapolis, the epicenter of the Black Lives Matter movement this summer following Floyd\u2019s death. Kenosha, on the western shore of Lake Michigan, lies about 40 miles south of Milwaukee and 60 miles north of Chicago."}]}
