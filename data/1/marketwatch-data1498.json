The U.S. now has almost 5 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, and at least 160,111 people have died. And while case numbers are coming down in some places that were recently seeing spikes, confusion over how some localities are reporting their infections has raised speculation that the publicly available numbers are not offering a true picture. California state officials said Thursday they have identified a bug in the electronic system used for collecting infectious-disease data, creating confusion just as public health, education and business leaders are trying to plan for an uncertain future, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. The problem may have led to underreporting of COVID-19 cases in many if not all counties, the paper reported. Gov. Gavin Newsom has been using those numbers to reassure Californians that their numbers were coming down. News on Thursday that Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine tested positive for COVID-19, only to test negative hours later using a different kind of test, highlights the problem facing states grappling with unreliable test kits. DeWine was first tested using an antigen test, which is faster but understood to be less accurate than a polymerase chain-reaction test, which delivered the later negative result. The governor was being tested ahead of planned meeting with President Donald Trump. The news caps a week in which testing has been a major area of concern for experts, who say the U.S. is still not conducting enough tests, or following through with contact tracing and isolation. A group of governors combined forces earlier this week to order millions of tests in an effort to reduce the backlog. Read now:Coronavirus testing in the U.S. is dropping, even as deaths mount A Pew Research Center survey published Thursday found most Americans \u2014 69% of those polled \u2014 believe state governments moved too quickly to lift restrictions on movement, creating the current wave that is moving fast across the South, West and even Midwest regions that previously had few cases. The survey of 11,001 adults conducted July 27 to Aug. 2 found about six in 10 Americans believe the U.S. response to the outbreak has been less effective than those of other wealthy nations. The U.S. has about 4% of the global population but accounts for roughly a quarter of global cases and deaths. Nearly half of Americans, or 48%, rate President Donald Trump\u2019s response to the pandemic \u201cpoor,\u201d up 16 points since March. \u201cPositive views of the performance of public health officials also have declined significantly: 63% now say public health officials, such as those with the CDC, are doing an excellent or good job in responding to the coronavirus outbreak, down from 79% in March,\u201d the survey found. Latest tallies There are now 19.1 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, the Johns Hopkins data shows, and 715,802 people have died. At least 11.6 million people are confirmed to have recovered from the illness. Brazil is second to the U.S. with 2.9 million cases and 98,493 deaths. India is third measured by cases that rose above 2 million on Thursday, followed by Russia with 875,378 and South Africa with 538,184. Mexico has 462,690 cases and 50,517 deaths, the third highest in the world. The U.K. has 309,796 cases and 46,498 fatalities, the highest in Europe and fourth highest in the world. China, where the illness was first reported late last year, has 88,460 cases, and 4,680 fatalities.|What\u2019s the latest medical news? Pfizer Inc. PFE, -0.27% will help manufacture Gilead Sciences Inc.\u2019s GILD, +0.82% COVID-19 treatment remdesivir as part of a multiyear agreement, MarketWatch\u2019s Jaimy Lee reported. The news marks a rare manufacturing deal between two of the world\u2019s largest drug makers and reflects the urgency in developing treatments and therapies for the deadly illness. \u201cTogether, we are more powerful than alone,\u201d Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said in a news release. Remdesivir, which has received an emergency-use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for severely ill COVID-19 patients, has not been formally approved by the regulator. Separately, the National Institutes of Health will conduct a randomized, controlled clinical trial testing a combination of remdesivir with Merck KGaA\u2019s MRK, +0.46% interferon beta-1a as a treatment for COVID-19 patients. The study plans to enroll 1,000 people who have been hospitalized because of a COVID-19 infection. The federal agency said it expects to have preliminary results in the fall. The trial is one of several that have been initiated to pair the investigational therapy with other drugs to see if the combination can better treat severely ill COVID-19 patients. The list includes an NIH trial pairing remdesivir with Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, +2.20% and Incyte Corp.\u2019s INCY, +3.19% Olumiant. Roche Holding AG ROG, +1.80% has also said it will test its rheumatoid arthritis drug in combination with remdesivir. What\u2019s the economy saying? The torrid pace of U.S. employment growth in the late spring gave way in July to a sharp slowdown in hiring, underscoring the fragile nature of a recovery with the coronavirus still running rampant in many states, MarketWatch\u2019s Jeffry Bartash reported. The economy recaptured 1.76 million jobs last month, just one-third of the revised 4.79 million gain in June. The official unemployment rate, meanwhile, fell for the third month in a row to 10.2% from 11.1%, the government said Friday. The increase in new jobs was slightly above the 1.68 million anticipated by a MarketWatch-compiled forecast. The smaller increase in job creation took place against the backdrop of surge in coronavirus cases in a number of states, including California, Texas and Florida. Some restrictions on businesses were reimposed, and Americans showed more caution in where they went and what they did.

So far it\u2019s restored about 9.3 million, leaving well more than half of the Americans who lost their jobs in the lurch. \u201cThe economic outlook deteriorated markedly from the middle to the end of July as consumers became less willing to spend money, and businesses grew increasingly uncertain about the demand for their goods,\u201d said economist John Leer at Morning Consult. \u201cAs a result, the current employment situation is likely weaker than these numbers indicate.\u201d Read:Consumers hold the key to an economic recovery and right now they\u2019re very anxiousWhat are companies saying?
