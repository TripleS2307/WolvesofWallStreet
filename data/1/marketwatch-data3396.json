Ford F, -1.36% said it earned $1.1 billion, or 28 cents a share, in the quarter, including a $3.5 billion gain on investments in Argo AI, and compared with earnings of 4 cents a share in the year-ago period. Adjusted for one-time items, the company lost 35 cents a share in the quarter, contrasting with an adjusted profit of 28 cents a share a year ago. Revenue fell 50% to $19.4 billion from $38.9 billion a year ago. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected Ford to report an adjusted loss of $1.17 a share on sales of $19.4 billion. Ford shares rose nearly 4% in after-hours trading as the company also sought to assuage any concerns about its liquidity and said it remained focused on autonomous and electric vehicles. The stock pared gains as the extended session progressed. The second-quarter adjusted loss \u201cwasn\u2019t nearly as steep as the Street had anticipated,\u201d said Garrett Nelson, an analyst with CFRA. \u201cFrom our perspective, the biggest positive was guidance for Q3 adjusted EBIT\u201d between $500 million and $1.5 billion, which is ahead of the current consensus of $477 million \u201cand implies significant improvement from the Q2 loss of $1.95 billion.\u201d Nelson cautioned, however, that while results were \u201csolid,\u201d Ford shares already had a sharp rebound from their March lows \u201cand the company remains in the middle of an expensive, multi-year restructuring. \u201cAdditionally, we don\u2019t see Ford\u2019s sales returning to pre-pandemic levels anytime soon, but we think the buzz surrounding the Bronco and Mustang Mach-E are positives.\u201d In a call with analysts following results, Chief Executive Jim Hackett said that the recently revealed, all-new Bronco has been received with an outpouring of enthusiasm, and reservations for the vehicle, at 150,000, are past even the company\u2019s \u201cmost optimistic initial projections.\u201d Hackett said that he feels \u201cbetter and better\u201d about the company\u2019s decision to focus on SUVs and pickup trucks rather than on sedans two years ago. It was a controversial move at the time but it has paid off, he said. Ford delivered \u201ca strong Q2 while keeping each other safe, caring for customers and neighbors, and assuring tomorrow,\u201d Hackett said in a statement before the call. Ford highlighted \u201cfurther progress\u201d in cost-cutting moves and capital expenditures and said it clinched the deal with Volkwagen AG VOW, -0.20% for commercial vehicles, electric vehicles and pickups.

Ford\u2019s earnings comes as Tesla Inc. TSLA, +1.89% and General Motors Co. GM, -0.15% reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings. GM earlier this week reported a narrower-than-expected loss mostly on the sales of its pickup trucks, and said nearly all its U.S. factories are running at pre-pandemic levels. Tesla last week reported a surprise quarterly profit, setting the stock on a course to join the S&P 500 index. Ford shares have lost 28% so far this year, compared with losses around 8% for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% and contrasting with gains around 0.4% for the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% ."}]}
