Trump's signing of the bill came on the same day that an excerpt of former national security adviser John Bolton's new book was released, in which Bolton claims Trump told Chinese President Xi Jinping he should build detainment camps for Uighurs. The act signed by Trump calls for a report to Congress within 180 days identifying Chinese officials and any other individuals who are responsible for carrying out torture and prolonged detention."}]}
