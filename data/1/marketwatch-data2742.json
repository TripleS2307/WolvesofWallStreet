New applications for unemployment benefits, a rough gauge of layoffs, slipped for the first time in three weeks to 1.19 million from 1.44 million, the Labor Department said Thursday. It was the biggest one-week decline since early June. Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast 1.4 million new claims in the seven days ended Aug. 1. These seasonally adjusted figures reflect applications filed the traditional way through state unemployment offices. The big drop in claims might stem in part from the pending expiration of a $600 federal unemployment stipend at the end of July, economists say. The program\u2019s lapse could have led some people to believe they were no longer eligible to file. Another possibility: The spike in coronavirus cases since Memorial Day also began to wane toward the end of last month, potentially helping to stabilize the labor market. \u201cThe story here, we think, is that layoffs triggered by the second wave of Covid-19 in the South and West are now falling,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.

Some restrictions were reimposed on businesses and companies were forced to lay off or furlough workers, some for the second time. But cases now appear to be declining again. Similarly, new claims for benefits filed through a temporary federal-relief program fell sharply to 655,707, bringing total U.S. applications for the week to an unadjusted 1.64 million. That\u2019s the lowest level since the crisis began in March. The number of people receiving traditional jobless benefits through the states, meanwhile, dropped by a seasonally adjusted 844,000 to a post-pandemic low of 16.1 million. These so-called continuing claims are reported with a one-week lag. Some 31.3 million people were still receiving benefits through eight state and federal assistance programs as of July 18, up from an unadjusted 30.8 million in the prior week. These figures are reported with a two-week lag. MarketWatch is reporting select jobless claims data using actual or unadjusted figures to give a clearer picture of unemployment. The seasonally adjusted estimates typically expected by Wall Street have become less accurate during the pandemic because its unprecedented nature makes comparisons with the past untenable.

A raft of economic indicators point to a slowdown in hiring and some even point to an outright decline in employment. The government on Friday is expected to report the U.S. created 1.75 million new jobs last month \u2014 about two-thirds fewer than the increase in June. The fresh uncertainty is making businesses skittish about bringing back more workers, at least until the latest viral outbreak dies down. And it\u2019s making painstakingly slow negotiations in Washington between Democrats and Republicans on how to extend unemployment benefits even more critical to the well-being of millions of Americans who can\u2019t go back to work through no fault of their own. What they are saying?: \u201cThe possibility of mounting layoffs that could become permanent is high,\u201d said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics. \u201cWithout effective virus containment the recovery remains at risk from ongoing job losses that could further restrain incomes and spending.\u201d Market reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% and S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% were set to open modestly higher in Thursday trades."}]}
