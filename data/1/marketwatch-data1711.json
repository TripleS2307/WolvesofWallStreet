PRICING POLITICS The orders targeting drug prices \u201cmay illustrate efforts by the Trump administration to shore up support for a key voter issue with President Trump and other Republicans losing momentum ahead of the election,\u201d said Height Capital Markets analysts in a note Friday. Trump said the first order \u201cwill require federal community health centers to pass the giant discounts they receive from drug companies on insulin and EpiPens directly to their patients,\u201d while the second allows some drug importation and the third will take discounts away from middlemen such as pharmacy benefits manager and give them to patients. The fourth order will require that Medicare purchase drugs at the same price as foreign countries pay, Trump said. It \u201cwill end global freeloading on the backs of American patients and American seniors,\u201d he said. As a result of the orders, the heads of major drug companies have requested a meeting on Tuesday to discuss how to lower drug prices and out-of-pocket expenses for Americans, the president added. If talks are successful, the administration may not need to implement the fourth executive order, he said.
