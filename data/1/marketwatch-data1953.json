AFP/Getty Images NEW YORK \u2014 The presidential debate commission says it will soon adopt changes to its format to avoid a repeat of the disjointed first meeting between President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden. The commission said Wednesday the debate \u201cmade clear that additional structure should be added to the format of the remaining debates to ensure a more orderly discussion of the issues.\u201d One possibility being discussed is to give the moderator the ability to cut off the microphone of one of the debate participants while his opponent is talking, according to a person familiar with the deliberations who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The next presidential debate is a town hall format scheduled for Oct. 15 in Miami. Meanwhile, the Nielsen company said that 73.1 million people watched the debate on television, where it was shown on 16 networks. That\u2019s more than any other television event since the Super Bowl, even if it fell short of the 84 million who watched the first debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton in 2016. That was the most-watched presidential debate ever. Moderator Chris Wallace struggled to gain control of Tuesday\u2019s debate in Cleveland because of frequent interruptions, primarily by Trump. The candidates interrupted Wallace or their opponent 90 times in the 90-minute debate, 71 of them by Trump, according to an analysis by The Washington Post. Wallace, of Fox News, pleaded for a more orderly debate, at one point looking at Trump and saying, \u201cthe country would be better served if we allowed both people to speak with fewer interruptions. I\u2019m appealing to you, sir, to do that.\u201d \u201cAsk him, too,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWell, frankly, you\u2019ve been doing more interrupting than he has,\u201d Wallace said. Biden on Wednesday called the debate \u201ca national embarrassment.\u201d But despite some suggestions that the final two presidential encounters be canceled, both campaigns said they expected their candidate to attend. Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh said the commission was \u201conly doing this because their guy got pummeled last night. President Trump was the dominant force and now Joe Biden is trying to work the refs.\u201d ABC News\u2019 Martha Raddatz, who moderated one of the three Trump-Clinton debates in 2016, said Wallace was put in nearly an impossible situation. Faced with the same behavior, she said she might have called a full stop to the debate for a moment to recalibrate. She never had the option, technically, to cut off the microphone of a candidate four years ago, she said. It also wasn\u2019t in the rules that were agreed to in advance by the candidates and commission. \u201cTo say, \u2018He\u2019s not going to follow the rules so we aren\u2019t, either,\u2019 It\u2019s an unprecedented situation,\u201d Raddatz said. \u201cThat was so out of control.\u201d Twitter was ablaze with criticism for Wallace early in the debate for losing control of the proceedings. That was illustrated by MSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough, who tweeted \u201cWhat is Chris Wallace doing? He has no control over the debate. He asks a question and let\u2019s Trump continue yelling. This is a disgrace.\u201d By the time he was on \u201cMorning Joe\u201d the next morning, Scarborough had cooled off. He called on the debate commission to act. \u201cWhile it was extraordinarily frustrating, I think all of us need to walk a mile in his shoes before saying the morning after, \u2018He could have done this, he could have done that,\u2019\u201d Scarborough said. Some of the president\u2019s supporters felt that Wallace was too hard on their candidate. Trump himself suggested he was also debating Wallace, \u201cbut that\u2019s no surprise.\u201d Wallace even got some criticism from opinion personalities on his own network. \u201cTrump is debating the moderator and Biden,\u201d prime-time host Laura Ingraham tweeted during the debate. Another Fox colleague, Geraldo Rivera, expressed more sympathy. \u201cThe guy signed up to moderate a debate and he ended up trying to referee a knife fight,\u201d he said. Wallace, host of \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d was not immediately made available for comment by Fox. There is some skepticism about what the commission can do that is really meaningful. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that there\u2019s a format change that can solve that problem,\u201d said Sen. Pat Toomey, Republican, of battleground state Pennsylvania. Wallace is the only presidential debate moderator this cycle with prior experience, after receiving praise for handling the final Clinton-Trump debate in 2016. The other two moderators are Steve Scully of C-SPAN and Kristen Welker of NBC News. Scully moderates the Miami debate, a town hall format where citizens get to ask questions, which may make interruptions more difficult. \u201cHaving prepared for these, the town hall is a completely different event in the debate Olympics,\u201d tweeted David Plouffe, an adviser to former President Barack Obama. \u201cIf Trump brings the same nastiness to Florida, it will be doubly painful to watch but it will be doubly painful for him politically.\u201d"}]}
