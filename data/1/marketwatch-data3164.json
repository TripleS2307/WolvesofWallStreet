While Netflix NFLX, +1.43%  still has dozens of original series, specials and movies on tap for August 2020, barely a handful have mass appeal. The most promising of the bunch are Season 5 of \"Lucifer\" (Aug. 21), the cult favorite that Netflix rescued from Fox about a bored devil who works with the LAPD as a side hustle; \"Hoops\" (Aug. 21), an animated comedy about a foul-mouthed high school basketball coach, with voice work from Jake Johnson and Ron Funches; and \"Project Power,\" (Aug. 14), a blockbuster-ish action movie about a pill that gives people superpowers for 5 minutes at a time, starring Jamie Foxx and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. div.youtube { height:0; position:relative; padding-bottom:56.25%; } div.youtube > iframe { position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; } Other notable additions include new seasons of international series such as Denmark's post-apocalyptic drama \"Rain\" (Aug. 6), Spain's period drama \"High Seas\" (Aug. 7), and Brazil's dystopian thriller \"3%\" (Aug. 14); the new documentary series \"Immigration Nation\" (Aug. 3); and a new season of the real-estate reality show \"Selling Sunset\" (Aug. 7). Update: The Trump administration has reportedly tried to block the release of \"Immigration Nation,\" which shows some ICE agents in an unfavorable light - which just might make it must-see TV.
