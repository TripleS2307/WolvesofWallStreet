That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the message from many doctors and public health experts after President Trump downplayed the coronavirus threat by tweeting that Americans should learn to live with COVID-19 as they have adapted to deal with seasonal influenza. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFlu season is coming up! Many people every year, sometimes over 100,000, and despite the Vaccine, die from the Flu,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump tweeted, less than a day after returning to the White House following his hospitalization for COVID-19 at Walter Reed Medical Center over the weekend. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre we going to close down our Country? No, we have learned to live with it, just like we are learning to live with Covid, in most populations far less lethal!!!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Twitter TWTR, -0.23% \u00c2 later flagged the tweet for \u00e2\u0080\u009cspreading misleading and potentially harmful information related to COVID-19,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and Facebook FB, +0.26% \u00c2 pulled the post down completely, because scientific data shows that the two respiratory diseases, while they sometimes share similar symptoms, are not the same. The coronavirus is currently much more dangerous. A study published in JAMA Internal Medicine in May compared the number of deaths from COVID-19 at that time, and the deaths from seasonal influenza during the peak weeks of the last seven flu seasons. The findings: COVID-19 deaths counted in mid-April were about 20 times higher than the seasonal flu deaths during their worst weeks. The president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flu death toll is also higher than what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported for the U.S. Influenza is responsible for between 12,000 and 61,000 deaths a year, according to the CDC, and an estimated 22,000 people in the U.S. died from the flu during the 2019-2020 influenza season. This week, the U.S. passed 210,000 COVID-19 deaths since the spring; more than the total number of influenza deaths from the past five flu seasons combined. The flu is certainly a serious health threat, however, and public health services such as the CDC, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) are warning about a \u00e2\u0080\u009ctwindemic\u00e2\u0080\u009d of influenza and COVID-19 this fall as America enters flu season from October through May. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a look at what we know about the 2020-2021 flu season to date, and how the coronavirus pandemic could complicate things. Why are people worried about a \u00e2\u0080\u009ctwindemic\u00e2\u0080\u009d? The U.S. is entering flu season right now (which runs between October and May, and peaks between December and February) while the country is still grappling with the coronavirus pandemic that has infected an estimated 7.5 million Americans and counting. So public officials are concerned about both viruses attacking the population at once \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a \u00e2\u0080\u009ctwindemic, if you will \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and overwhelming hospital beds and emergency services, especially since severe cases of both viruses require the same life-saving medical equipment. The flu has seen between 140,000 and 810,000 people hospitalized each year since 2010. CDC director Robert Redfield has warned that America is bracing for \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe worst fall, from a public health perspective, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever had\u00e2\u0080\u009d with COVID-19 and influenza. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEither one of those by themselves can stress certain hospital systems,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leading infectious disease expert, has also said that \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe need to hunker down\u00e2\u0080\u009d this fall and winter. Read:CDC director warns America is in for the \u00e2\u0080\u0098worst fall \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever had\u00e2\u0080\u0099 But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just about overflowing intensive care units. Dr. David Cennimo, an infectious disease expert at Rutgers, told MarketWatch that both viruses overwhelming doctors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 offices, urgent care centers and clinics is also a major concern. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we can remove the burden of symptomatic influenza, we are helping to keep the economy running, keep the workforce running, and to just keep people out of doctors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 offices,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Fortunately, the basic protective measures recommended in preventing the spread of COVID-19 can also stem influenza spread: Wearing masks, staying six feet apart and washing hands. But there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another weapon in the anti-flu arsenal: getting the flu shot. You can catch COVID-19 and the flu at the same time \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but you can only vaccinate against one of them right now. Earlier in the pandemic, there were some cases of Americans contracting both COVID-19 and the flu at once, although there is not a lot of data on those situations yet because the pandemic hit at the tail-end of flu season, and the Southern Hemisphere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flu season was especially mild this year (more on that later). The CDC says that this is still being studied. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPatients tend to do worse if they are fighting multiple respiratory infections at the same time. So you definitely wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want both the flu and COVID at the same time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cennimo said. \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo choose to not get the flu vaccine is to choose actively to say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I want no chance of protection.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Dr. David Cennimo While there are four COVID-19 vaccines in late-stage studies, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unlikely that a vaccine will be widely available to the public before spring 2021, which is when the flu season will hopefully be winding down. But we do have a flu vaccine now, which can at least remove influenza from the twindemic equation. (And no, the flu vaccine will not prevent you from catching COVID-19, as they are two different viruses.) Yet less than half of the country (47%) got a flu shot last year. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo choose to not get the flu vaccine is to choose actively to say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I want no chance of protection,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Cennimo. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd that makes no sense to me, given the incredible safety of these vaccines.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Even a less effective flu vaccine is better than no flu vaccine. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let reports that influenza vaccines have been less effective in some past flu seasons put you off. (For example, the 2017-18 vaccine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efficacy rate was just about 36%, which means it cut flu-related doctor visits by that amount.) The vaccine can still lower your risk of complications or dying from the flu, even if you do get sick. Last flu season, 188 children and teens under age 19 died of complications from influenza, according to the CDC. About 80% of children who die from the flu are not vaccinated. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe flu is tricky. It mutates a lot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cennimo said, but he explained that a flu vaccine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s effectiveness is about more than just how many infections it prevents. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe people that were immunized against influenza and subsequently got influenza that year, they went to the hospital a lot less than people who weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t immunized. They got intubated a lot, lot less,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a value to partial immunity, and sort of attenuating the infection.\u00e2\u0080\u009d All Americans ages 6 months and up should get the influenza vaccine. The CDC and AAP are urging everyone over the age of six months to get vaccinated for the flu this year. Problem is, one in seven parents have said that the fear of exposing their kids to COVID-19 was keeping them from taking their kids to the doctor for regular checkups and immunizations, like the flu shot. Or people who used to take for granted that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be given their flu shot at their workplace, who are now working from home, may not know where to go to get vaccinated this year. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very concerned about how this will affect vaccination rates,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cennimo said. Read:1 in 3 parents won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t vaccinate their children against the flu, even though pediatricians say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0098more important than ever\u00e2\u0080\u0099 What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more, one in three American parents plan to skip getting flu shots for their kids during the pandemic, according to the recent National Poll on Children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Health, even though both the CDC and the AAP have said its more important than ever right now. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs a pediatrician, I am very concerned about the health of children and their families this fall if these two potentially deadly viruses [COVID-19 and the flu] are circulating in the community at the same time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Flor Munoz, the lead author of the AAP recommendations, said in a recent statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cChildren play a pivotal role in the transmission of influenza to others in their household. They can also get seriously ill from influenza without a vaccination.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Southern Hemisphere had a mild flu season \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean the Northern Hemisphere will, too. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one silver lining: Social distancing measures, as well as closing down schools and non-essential businesses earlier in the pandemic, seem to have almost eradicated the flu in the Southern Hemisphere during that region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s winter. Australia and South America, which are just ending their flu seasons, have seen a steep decline in the number of influenza infections and deaths so far this year compared with the previous five years. But the Northern Hemisphere can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just assume it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in for a mild flu season, too. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always very difficult to predict what kind of a flu year you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to have,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Cennimo. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tend to believe that the U.S. looks too much like New Zealand. And we also did not control our COVID-19 numbers nearly as effectively as they did.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Read:These charts show one possible silver lining of the pandemic And while social distancing measures, which some Americans have hesitated to adopt, likely did contribute to the Southern Hemisphere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s milder flu season, the citizens of New Zealand and Australia also embraced the flu vaccine in a way Americans haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t of late. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you take a deep dive into the data, their flu vaccination rates went up between 20% and 40%,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cennimo said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo maybe that is what is working.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But less than half of Americans (47%) got vaccinated for the flu last year. The CDC normally recommends that 60% to 70% of the country get the influenza inoculation to keep the virus under control, and Redfield is pushing for 65% compliance this year. But as noted above, many Americans are hesitant to get vaccinated or to vaccinate their children. There is enough flu vaccine available for everyone to get vaccinated. Do not worry about flu vaccine shortages. The CDC normally purchases about 500,000 doses of the vaccine each year for uninsured adults. This year, Redfield said that the CDC ordered extra, and between 194 million and 198 million doses are on the way for the U.S. While some people may occasionally find that their drugstores or clinics are temporarily out of stock, just be patient. Less than half of the available flu vaccines have been distributed so far, and plenty more are on the way. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis year I think everyone is wanting to get their vaccine and maybe wanting it earlier than usual,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Daniel Jernigan of the CDC told the Associated Press. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not able to get your vaccination now, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get frustrated,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and keep trying. But get it done sooner rather than later, as the flu vaccine takes up to two weeks to reach peak effectiveness Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where to get the flu vaccine. Most Americans with health insurance can get the flu vaccine without coughing up a copay. The vaccine can come in the form of a single injection, two shots to boost protection in older adults, and a nasal spray. The CDC recommends them all, so get whichever one is available to you, or that you are most comfortable getting. Just get it soon. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re uninsured, the shots generally run between $40 and $60 at drugstores like CVS CVS, -1.76%, Walmart WMT, +1.00% \u00c2 and Target TGT, +1.14%, and people with Costco COST, +1.19% \u00c2 or Sam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Club memberships have been able to get the shot for just $20 or $30. You can also find health centers near you, or look up your state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s free and discounted vaccine offerings, at Vaccines.gov. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no way to tell whether your symptoms are COVID-19, the flu or just a cold unless you get tested for COVID-19 and the flu. Unfortunately, you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t self-diagnose which respiratory illness you have at home, because COVID-19 symptoms can be so variable, and also because so many coronavirus patients are asymptomatic. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not possible,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cennimo said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA sudden onset fever, malaise, body aches, headache and cough tends to be the classic flu, but COVID-19 has fever and fatigue, too. The only way to know is getting tested for the flu, and getting tested for COVID.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Symptoms of COVID-19 can include fever, cough and shortness of breath, as well as the sudden loss of taste and/or smell, sore throat, headache, body aches, fatigue, chills, nausea and congestion. If you or someone in your family feels sick, call your health care provider \u00e2\u0080\u0094 do not just walk into an urgent care center or clinic without calling ahead. While public health experts do want Americans to reach out to their doctors if they feel sick, and to continue getting their regular wellness checkups, vaccinations and screenings, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to make an appointment ahead of time \u00e2\u0080\u0094 especially if you think you may have caught or been exposed to the coronavirus. Visiting a health care center without warning could see you inadvertently infecting other patients or medical staff. Call ahead. Most flu patients have a mild illness and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need medical care or antiviral drugs, so the CDC recommends that they just stay home and avoid contact with people, except to get medical care. But call a health care provider, like your family doctor, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in a high risk group (young children, people over 65 and pregnant women), are very sick, or are worried about your illness. Those at high risk should get antiviral treatment ASAP, because it works best when started within two days after getting sick. Read:Fight the flu with these 10 proven treatments If you or someone in your household gets sick with what you think could be the coronavirus, however, then once again: stay home. Call your health care provider to describe your symptoms, tell them whether you are in a high risk group (older adults or those with underlying medical conditions) and see whether they advise getting a COVID-19 test. If you test positive \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or even if you do not get tested at all \u00e2\u0080\u0094 you should self-isolate for at least 10 days after symptoms appear. The CDC has more detailed guidance here. This story will be updated as we continue to learn more about COVID-19 and this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flu season."}]}
