Remdesivir was the first new drug to receive an emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration during the pandemic as a treatment for severely ill COVID-19 patients. Clinical studies found it can reduce recovery times for hospitalized patients. Trump announced early Friday morning that he and the First Lady Melania Trump had tested positive for the coronavirus; since then several White House staffers have also tested positive for COVID-19. On Friday evening, Trump was given Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s REGN, +0.36% neutralizing antibody cocktail, which is still being studied in clinical trials as a treatment for non-hospitalized patients with milder and more moderate forms of the disease. In a letter shared early Saturday morning, Dr. Conley, the president's physician, said Trump had been moved to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., and he had also been given remdesivir. Conley said Trump does not require supplemental oxygen."}]}
