(AP) \u2014 A judge on Wednesday halted the execution of a man said to be suffering from dementia, who had been set to die by lethal injection in the federal government\u2019s second execution after a 17-year hiatus. Wesley Ira Purkey, convicted of a gruesome 1998 kidnapping and killing, was scheduled for execution Wednesday at the U.S. Penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana, where Daniel Lewis Lee was put to death Tuesday after his eleventh-hour legal bids failed. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan in Washington, D.C., imposed two injunctions on Wednesday prohibiting the federal Bureau of Prisons from moving forward with Purkey\u2019s execution. The Justice Department immediately appealed in both cases. A separate temporary stay was already in place from the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The early morning legal wrangling suggests a volley of litigation will continue in the hours ahead of Purkey\u2019s scheduled execution, similar to what happened when the government executed Lee, following a ruling from the Supreme Court. Lee, convicted of killing an Arkansas family in a 1990s plot to build a whites-only nation, was the first of four condemned men scheduled to die in July and August despite the coronavirus pandemic raging inside and outside prisons. Purkey, 68, of Lansing, Kansas, would be the second, but his lawyers were still expected to press for a ruling from the Supreme Court on his competency. \u201cThis competency issue is a very strong issue on paper,\u201d said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. \u201cThe Supreme Court has halted executions on this issue in the past. At a minimum, the question of whether Purkey dies is going to go down to the last minute.\u201d Chutkan didn\u2019t rule on whether Purkey is competent but said the court needs to evaluate the claim. She said that while the government may disagree with Purkey\u2019s lawyers about his competency, there\u2019s no question he\u2019d suffer \u201cirreparable harm\u201d if he\u2019s put to death before his claims can be evaluated. Lee\u2019s execution went forward a day late. It was scheduled for Monday afternoon, but the Supreme Court only gave the green light in a narrow 5-4 ruling early Tuesday. The issue of Purkey\u2019s mental health arose in the runup to his 2003 trial and when, after the verdict, jurors had to decide whether he should be put to death in the killing of 16-year-old Jennifer Long in Kansas City, Missouri. Prosecutors said he raped and stabbed her, dismembered her with a chainsaw, burned her and dumped her ashes 200 miles (320 kilometers) away in a septic pond in Kansas. Purkey was separately convicted and sentenced to life in the beating death of 80-year-old Mary Ruth Bales, of Kansas City, Kansas. But the legal questions of whether he was mentally fit to stand trial or to be sentenced to die are different from the question of whether he\u2019s mentally fit enough now to be put to death. Purkey\u2019s lawyers argue he clearly isn\u2019t, saying in recent filings he suffers from advancing Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \u201cHe has long accepted responsibility for the crime that put him on death row,\u201d one of this lawyers, Rebecca Woodman, said. \u201cBut as his dementia has progressed, he no longer has a rational understanding of why the government plans to execute him.\u201d Purkey believes his planned execution is part of a conspiracy involving his attorneys, Woodman said. In other filings, they describe delusions that people were spraying poison into his room and that drug dealers implanted a device in his chest meant to kill him. While various legal issues in Purkey\u2019s case have been hashed, rehashed and settled by courts over nearly two decades, the issue of mental fitness for execution can only be addressed once a date is set, according to Dunham, who teaches law school courses on capital punishment. A date was set only last year. \u201cCompetency is something that is always in flux,\u201d so judges can only assess it in the weeks or days before a firm execution date, he said. In a landmark 1986 decision, the Supreme Court ruled the Constitution prohibits executing someone who lacks a reasonable understanding of why he\u2019s being executed. It involved the case of Alvin Ford, who was convicted of murder but whose mental health deteriorated behind bars to the point, according to his lawyer, he believed he was pope. Legal standards as to whether someone has a rational understanding of why an execution is taking place can be complex, Dunham explained. \u201cI could say I was Napoleon,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if I say I understand that Napoleon was sentenced to death for a crime and is being executed for it \u2014 that could allow the execution to go ahead.\u201d Purkey\u2019s mental issues go beyond Alzheimer\u2019s, his lawyers have said. They say he was subject to sexual and mental abuse as a child and, at 14, was diagnosed with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression and psychosis. Last week, three mental health organizations urged U.S. Attorney William Barr to stop Purkey\u2019s execution and commute his sentence to life in prison without possibility of parole. The National Alliance on Mental Illness, Mental Health America and the Treatment Advocacy Center said executing mentally ailing people like Purkey \u201cconstitutes cruel and unusual punishment and does not comport with \u2018evolving standards of decency.\u2019\u201d The mother of the slain teenager, Glenda Lamont, told the Kansas City Star last year she planned to attend Purkey\u2019s execution. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say that I\u2019m happy,\u201d Lamont said. \u201cAt the same time, he is a crazy mad man that doesn\u2019t deserve, in my opinion, to be breathing anymore.\u201d The runup to Lee\u2019s execution demonstrated that a lot can still happen before Purkey\u2019s scheduled one. On Monday, hours before Lee was set to be put to death, a U.S. District Court judge put the execution on hold over concerns from death row inmates on how executions were to be carried out, and an appeals court upheld it, before the Supreme Court overturned it early Tuesday."}]}
