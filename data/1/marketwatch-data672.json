Trump has approved using existing filling station pumps to distribute higher-ethanol gasoline. \u201cSubject only to State approval, our important Ethanol Industry will be allowed to use the 10% Pumps for the 15% BLEND,\u201d Trump tweeted. The administration\u2019s announcement followed a conversation Trump had with Sen. Joni Ernst, an Iowa Republican who\u2019s been pushing for the change as she seeks re-election. Ernst, in her own tweet, welcomed the news. But some rural voters groups remained wary of what they argue historically has been Trump\u2019s backing of the oil industry CL00, -1.62% at the expense of promoting alternative fuels and said the decision from the president had been a long time coming. \u201cThe announcement made today is little more than an election-year gambit,\u201d said Chris Gibbs, the board president of Ohio-based policy group Rural America 2020. \u201cYou can\u2019t sell out to Big Oil for the first 3 1/2 years of your presidency and then expect farmers to believe you with 52 days to the election,\u201d Gibbs said. \u201cYou can\u2019t undo 4 billion lost gallons of biofuel with last minute election games.\u201d The Trump administration\u2019s EPA in 2019 approved the sale of a 15% ethanol-gasoline blend known as E15 year-round. It previously had been blocked for sale in the summer in many areas where smog is an issue. Most gasoline sold in the U.S. is a 10% blend known as E10."}]}
