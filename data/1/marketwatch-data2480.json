People are going about their business as usual and construction on the border wall on the southern border with Mexico appears to be gaining momentum. President Donald Trump made a trip to the state this week for a rally in a private church in the northern part of the city, attended by thousands of young people, few of whom wore masks. He marked the completion of the 200th mile of the border wall in Yuma. And that\u2019s part of the problem, health workers say. More people need to wear masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. \u201c While restaurants and bars generally followed the protocols, life continues like normal here. \u201d While restaurants, bars, and barbershops generally followed the protocols, life continues like normal here. Case in point: The state does not require masks to be worn in public, while many cities, including Phoenix, have adopted their own mask requirement. The early easing of the stay-at-home orders may have influenced the new surge of cases. Governor Doug Ducey, a Republican, let barbershops and salons reopen on May 8. Starting May 11, Arizona restaurants were allowed to offer dine-in services again. The scenes inside many of the state\u2019s hospitals tell a different story, as medical staff desperately work to attend to the rising number of coronavirus patients. On Friday, hospitals across the state have activated their emergency surge plans to deal with the increase in coronavirus patients. \u201cWhen we opened up our state, people started interacting with each other without practicing physical distance or wearing face masks as recommended by the CDC,\u201d said Christian Bime, who is the head of the division of Pulmonary Care at the Banner University Medical Center in Tucson, in the southern part of the state. \u201cNaturally, you can expect more infections this way,\u201d he says. Maria Singleton, a volunteer for Samaritans from Ajo, in Pima County: \u2018The construction of the wall sped up in February. It coincided with when COVID-19 came in.\u2019 Gaia Squarc \u2018These are things that happen once in a lifetime\u2019 When Bime moved from Cameroon, in Africa, to Michigan in the United States, years ago, he never imagined he\u2019d have to wake up at 4 a.m. every day to face a pandemic as a frontline doctor in Arizona. \u201cThese are things that happen once in a lifetime,\u201d says Bime, who is the head of the division of Pulmonary Care at the Banner University Medical Center in Tucson, in the southern part of the state. The U.S. hit its highest single-day count of confirmed coronavirus cases of 40,135 on Friday, Arizona reported 3,428 new cases, according to the Arizona Department Healthcare Services database. \u201c The U.S. hit its highest single-day count of coronavirus cases of 40,135 on Friday, Arizona 3,428 new cases. \u201d Along with Florida and Texas, some refer to Arizona as one of the frontrunners to become the new New York, as the new epicenter of the virus. \u201cThe main problem we have to face is the increase of patients that we are admitting to our hospitals, especially to the intensive care unit, over the past few weeks,\u201d said Bime. Along with his colleagues, he works every day, from dawn to sunset, and late into the evening, to provide care for as many patients as possible. \u201cIn an ordinary situation, you may have some patients who are very sick, and others that are not so sick. With coronavirus, almost all of them in the intensive care unit need a ventilator,\u201d says Bime, while sharing a glimmer of optimism: \u201cThe positive thing is that so far we have enough ventilators.\u201d As of Friday, 86% of current inpatient beds and 88% of ICU beds were in use, in Arizona, far more than the usual occupation rate versus 62% and 68% respectively before the coronavirus\u2019 first wave hit Arizona in late March, according to the Arizona Department Healthcare Services database. And Pima County, where Bime\u2019s hospital is located, is the second hardest-hit county in the state, with more than 6,800 positive cases and at least 266 deaths. If the rate of hospitalization is 7% across the state, Pima County counts 670 out of the 4514 hospitalizations overall. This round of infection is different from the first wave of coronavirus cases in April and May, Bime said: \u201cNow we are hospitalizing younger people with severe disease, too, in a range of 40-to-60-year-old.\u201d Arizona is one of the 19 states with the trend of new coronavirus cases still increasing.

Getty Gaia SquarcImages \u2018The construction of the wall sped up in February\u2019 Pima County is one of the hardest hit by the pandemic, according to the Arizona Department Healthcare Services database. \u201cThe construction of the wall sped up in February. It coincided with when COVID-19 came in,\u201d says Maria Singleton, a volunteer for Samaritans from Ajo, in Pima County. She also has a unique perspective on the wall. On Nov. 9, 1989, she witnessed the Berlin wall collapse in Europe, where she lived. Now she is witnessing the construction of a new wall as well as the outbreak of a new pandemic. She is part of a group of volunteers that organizes every week activities to rescue and to help migrants who cross the border, visits the border at least once a week, and has observed the increase in the number of trucks. \u201c On Nov. 9, 1989, Maria Singleton witnessed the Berlin wall collapse in Europe, where she lived. \u201d Singleton lives on a street that leads to the national park close to the border. We spent an hour on her street, and observed the trucks heading toward the border. Locals on Facebook FB, +0.26% have shared Singleton\u2019s concerns about the influx of workers. Ajo is among the poorest towns in Arizona. Households here have a median annual income of $33,178, close to half the median annual income of $61,937 in the U.S., according to the U.S. Census Bureau. \u201cThe virus hit poor and elder communities hard, and Ajo is one of them,\u201d says Singleton. Her house is not far from Ajo\u2019s historic center. The number of trucks she has seen driving south to build the wall at the border and the number of coronavirus cases have both been increasing in the last weeks, she said. \u201cWe have one little clinic here, but for the most part, people have to drive to Phoenix or Tucson if they want to go to hospitals. The outskirts of Phoenix are 90 miles away,\u201d says Singleton. When she moved to Ajo, she was imagining living in a quiet place. \u201cNow I find myself at the epicenter of everything,\u201d she says. Singleton and other residents are worried about the presence of so many workers coming to Ajo from across the U.S. \u201cWhen they are in town, they never wear masks,\u201d she adds. In a tiny village surrounded by mountains and kissed by the sun in Arizona close to New Mexico and far from Ajo and the southern border, Leonela Nelson, 36, a Navajo who works as a research program coordinator at Johns Hopkins Center for American Indian Health, and her family have managed to avoid the worst of the pandemic. \u201cA majority of the outbreak is in the larger cities hours away from here now,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen in April I saw the lines outside the few grocery stores we have, I was scared.\u201d But the Navajo Nation, an American Indian territory covering more than 17,000,000 acres between Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah, struggled to contain the pandemic, which caused 7,320 cases and 350 deaths. \u201cWhat is the CDC\u2019s first recommendation over the novel coronavirus? \u2018Washing your hands.\u2019 In the Nation, about 30% of the people do not even have running water,\u201d Nelson says. During the peak of the outbreak inside the reservation, the Navajo Nation government intensified testing and tracing and committed to a coronavirus-focused education campaign.

Her aunt is in her mid-60s, and she did not have pre-existing health conditions, but it took almost a month before she recovered. Nelson stopped by her house almost every day to check that everything was still in order. \u201cShe is getting better now, although it was a tough time for my family,\u201d she says. Bime, meanwhile, wakes up thinking about patients like Nelson\u2019s aunt every morning in Tucson. He is optimistic that they will get through this, but is less sure about how long that will take. \u201cThe greatest challenge that we experience in critical care units is that we can\u2019t let families see the patients in person,\u201d he says. Sometimes frontline workers have to replace the physical connection between them. \u201cWith one hand, you have the smartphone with Facetime AAPL, +1.74%, and with the other, you hold the hand of the patients like you were a family member.\u201d Gov. Doug Ducey allowed individual Arizona cities to create their own policies about face-covering requirements and enforcement on Wednesday. Getty Images"}]}
