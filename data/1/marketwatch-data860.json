Robert O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Brien, the national-security adviser, told reporters that he had not spoken directly to the president on Sunday but had talked with Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe said the president is doing very well and, not surprisingly, wants to come back home,\u00e2\u0080\u009d O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Brien said. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team of doctors at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center said they were hopeful that Trump could return to the White House on Monday. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Brien said a transfer of power to Vice President Mike Pence is not \u00e2\u0080\u009con the table right now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said the White House was prepared for any contingencies related to the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have plans for everything,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo far, the president is in great shape, [and] he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s firmly in command of the government of the country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Brien said. The president, O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Brien said, was set to receive a briefing from his foreign-affairs team including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo this afternoon Trump was flown Friday evening by helicopter to Walter Reed in Bethesda, Md. Concerns about the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health status have lingered despite two briefings from Dr. Sean Conley, the White House physician."}]}
