Well, almost nobody. Newsweek just checked in with Bone, whose 2016 \u00e2\u0080\u009c15 minutes of fame\u00e2\u0080\u009d as an undecided voter was sullied by the discovery of his icky Reddit history, and found he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty much sticking to the same message he espoused four years ago. Basically, neither candidate excites him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be perfectly honest, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m uncommitted again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bone explained. \u00e2\u0080\u009cVery, very few people in either of these election cycles were truly undecided. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re uncommitted, which means that you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really have a positive opinion of either candidate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bone, who endorsed Andrew Yang earlier this year, slammed President Trump as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cmaster of manipulating people\u00e2\u0080\u009d and said Joe Biden isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worthy of his support, either. The first presidential debate debacle only solidified his \u00e2\u0080\u009cuncommitted\u00e2\u0080\u009d stance. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe kind of got what we expected. In a way, we almost got what we deserved, because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve all played our part in raising the temperature of political discourse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt leads to a couple of people who are probably older than your grandparents, yelling at each other and telling each other to shut up, and talking over each other like drunk relatives at Thanksgiving. It was insanity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the video of his comments: div.youtube { height:0; position:relative; padding-bottom:56.25%; } div.youtube > iframe { position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; } With that, \u00e2\u0080\u009cKen Bone\u00e2\u0080\u009d quickly emerged as one of Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s TWTR, -0.23% top trending topics.
