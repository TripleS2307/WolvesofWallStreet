But Wallace himself disagrees. In a pair of interviews with the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times following Tuesday night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s debate, the embattled moderator and Fox News anchor reveals that muting the candidates still doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sit well with him at all, even as he agrees that the debate was \u00e2\u0080\u009ca terrible missed opportunity\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just sad with the way [it] turned out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs a practical matter, even if the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s microphone had been shut, he still could have continued to interrupt, and it might well have been picked up on Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s microphone, and it still would have disrupted the proceedings in the hall,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wallace, 72, told the New York Times.

He explained that he let the interjections go, at first, because he wanted to be as invisible as possible, and let the candidates talk. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI never dreamt that it would go off the tracks the way it did,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told the New York Times. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a pro.
