The regulator is expected to make a decision whether or not to approve aducanumab by March 7. In early 2019, Biogen had shelved the experimental therapy after a futility analysis indicated the drug wouldn't meet the primary endpoints in clinical studies. Then, in October, the company surprised investors by resurfacing plans to pursue FDA approval of aducanumab. Biogen's stock is down 6.4% for the year, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% is up 3.6%."}]}
