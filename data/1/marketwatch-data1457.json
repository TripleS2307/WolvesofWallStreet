Stocks closed higher after better-than-expected U.S. retail sales and industrial production data for May, along with a report of progress on a coronavirus therapeutic drug, but Fed Chair Powell suggested that Congress may need to spend more money to ensure the U.S. can reach a full economic recovery, during the first of two days of Congressional testimony. U.S. retail sales jumped by 17.7% in May, the government said Tuesday. Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast an 8.5% increase. \u201cWhile this has bolstered arguments in favor of a V-shaped recovery, we caution that the U.S. economy is only in the initial recovery phase \u2013 one in which strong growth figures from depressed levels of activity give the false impression of an immediate return to pre-Covid economic dynamism,\u201d wrote an Oxford Economics team led by Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist, in a note Tuesday following the retail sales update. U.S. industrial production for May rose by 1.4%, as many factories resumed operations after shutdowns spurred by the coronavirus crisis, the Federal Reserve said Tuesday. Capacity utilization came in at 64.8%. Investors also weighed a Bloomberg report that outlined Trump administration plans for a $1 trillion infrastructure spending package.

He\u2019s saying that jobs will come back, but it\u2019s going to take a long time. And some people may not be able to get back to work, because some of those service-sector entities have been lost, and probably are lost forever,\u201d he told MarketWatch. Stocks pared gains during Powell\u2019s testimony after the Fed chief said, \u201cI don\u2019t see us wanting to run through the bond market like an elephant,\u201d in reference to the central bank\u2019s announcement on Monday that it is expanding the scope of its $750 billion emergency corporate debt loan facility to include individual corporate bonds, which will be purchased in an index fashion. Recap: Powell testifies to Senate on economic outlook Investors also remain nervous about signs of rising coronavirus cases in the U.S. \u201cOne of the greatest fears is a resurgence in the number of cases and what the means for the potential economy recovery,\u201d Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors, told MarketWatch. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen in the past week or so,\u201d he said, adding that news reports on Tuesday about steroid treatments potentially improving the health of COVID-19 patients has helped ease some of the fears around rising infections in certain U.S. states, while also supporting rising stock prices. The BBC reported on Tuesday that dexamethasone, a cheap and widely available steroid, is showing signs of success in low doses when prescribed to patients who are suffering serious symptoms from the illness derived from the coronavirus. The report cited a study from Oxford University, which included 2,000 hospital patients who were given the steroid and were compared with more than 4,000 who didn\u2019t get the drug. The report indicated that for \u201cpatients on ventilators it cut death risk from 40% to 28%,\u201d and for \u201cpatients needing oxygen it cut death risk from 25% to 20%.\u201d Also on Tuesday Beijing ordered all schools to shutter in an effort to contain a new coronavirus outbreak, which already had spread to neighboring provinces, and said all people will need to be tested for the virus before they are allowed to leave the city, according to a Bloomberg News report.
