Andrew Cuomo announced will begin on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s scary,\u201d said Robert Guarino, who owns several restaurants in New York City and is the CEO of Five Napkin Burger, which has four locations in Manhattan. \u201cBut I\u2019m excited about starting to ramp up again and then getting people back to work.\u201d Cuomo shut down restaurants for all business except takeout and delivery orders on March 16 in New York City, once the national epicenter for the virus and where more than 17,000 lives have been lost. Since the shut down and throughout Phase 1, eateries have adjusted to a grab-and-go model, in which bars are temporarily allowed to serve liquor to-go along with food orders. Starting with Phase 2 on Monday, they will be allowed to serve customers outdoors, six feet apart. During Phase 3, restaurants will be allowed to serve customers indoors at 50% of maximum occupancy . But how exactly bars and restaurants in New York City will navigate phases of reopening with limited capacity, or be able to reopen at all, is still unclear. Watch: Inside Seattle\u2019s \u2018Autonomous Zone\u2019 \u201cThe vast majority of restaurants and bars are owned by small business owners,\u201d said Andrew Rigie, executive director of the New York City Hospitality Alliance, a nonprofit that represents and serves restaurant and nightlife establishments in the city. \u201cThey don\u2019t have big investors behind them or large cash reserves to weather this storm.\u201d David Stockwell is the owner of Faun in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, which specializes in Italian-leaning fine dining in a casual atmosphere. The restaurant closed down for months this spring because of coronavirus and PAUSE orders. He described the pandemic\u2019s effect on his business as getting \u201chit by a Mack truck.\u201d Faun has about three staff people at the moment, down from around 30 it has during the busiest times of the year. The restaurant has an outdoor patio, but with socially distancing, it will seat a fraction of what it could before the pandemic, and is at the whim of a rainstorm. \u201cIt\u2019s not just turning the switch back on,\u201d Stockwell said of reopening. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be at full revenue because we\u2019re limited in capacity. So you have to come up with a new model that works with this different kind of capacity and more delivery. And we weren\u2019t a restaurant that was really set up to do a lot of delivery in the first place.\u201d Meanwhile, restaurants will have to deal with previous costs like rent while competing for fewer customers. Other factors that will affect businesses during the next few months are a lack of tourists and lower foot traffic, according to Melissa Fleischut, the president and CEO of the New York State Restaurant Association, a trade group. It will be well into July or potentially later when restaurants can bring diners inside as part of Phase 3 of reopening. How quickly the city goes from one phase to another is based on how successful it is at keeping coronavirus infection rates low, diagnostic testing capacity available, and building a robust contact tracing program. Even then it will be at a reduced capacity. \u201cIf indoor dining is limited to 50% of their occupancy, which it is under the current state guidelines, where are they going to make the rest of it up?\u201d Fleischut said. \u201cAre they going to be able to increase delivery and takeout? Are they going to be able to use outdoor dining to help make that up?\u201d It\u2019s also unclear how comfortable New Yorkers will be to eat in restaurants, even when they\u2019re allowed. The coronavirus pandemic\u2019s effect on consumer behavior remains to be seen, but an economy that has been decimated does not bode well for discretionary spending. \u201cWhen are people going to get jobs back and have disposable income to eat and drink out?\u201d Rigie said.

To supplement that, de Blasio announced earlier this month a \u201cRestaurant Revitalization Program,\u201d to support restaurant workers and employers affected by COVID-19. The program includes short-term payroll support, and restaurants will be eligible for funding up to $30,000. However, only $3 million will be spent to support around 100 restaurants and 1,000 displaced restaurant workers in a city of millions. Before the pandemic, New York City had more than 25,000 eating and drinking establishments, according to the NYC Hospitality Alliance. All four locations of Five Napkin Burger have stayed open for delivery and takeout orders. The chain had around 300 employees before coronavirus quarantine, according to Guarino, and is now running with about 50 employees. Don\u2019t miss: As tables turn, New York fears visitors from out of state could cause rise in infections \u201cI almost feel like I\u2019m busier just trying to learn about the different loans, loan programs that are out there and figure out planning for the future and, you know, negotiating with landlords,\u201d Guarino said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very intense few months.\u201d All of the Five Napkin Burger locations already have sidewalk cafe permits, and Guarino was working to adjust what outdoor seating will look like during Phase 2. He will also reach out to some former staff about coming back for the next phase. \u201cOnce we actually start, once we have a better gauge of demand, then we\u2019ll know how many people we can bring back and when. And that\u2019s really what we\u2019re looking forward to,\u201d Guarino said."}]}
