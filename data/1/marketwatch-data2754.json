Geoffrey Berman, the former federal prosecutor for the Southern District of New York, provided the committee with a detailed account behind closed doors of three days in June as he was pushed out, according to his opening statement, which was obtained by the Associated Press. Berman said Barr, over a 45-minute session at the Pierre Hotel in New York, \u00e2\u0080\u009cpressed\u00e2\u0080\u009d him to step aside and take on a new job heading up the Justice Department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Civil Division so the administration could install Jay Clayton, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, to the top prosecutor post in Manhattan. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI told the attorney general that I was not interested,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Berman told the panel. Berman explained, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere were important investigations in the office that I wanted to see through to completion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He told Barr that, while he liked Clayton, he viewed the SEC commissioner as \u00e2\u0080\u009can unqualified choice\u00e2\u0080\u009d for the job. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe had had no criminal experience,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Berman said. Clayton reportedly has been a golf partner of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on several occasions, including, according to the New York Times, just days before Barr sought Berman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resignation from SDNY. When Barr warned Berman that if he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go voluntarily he would be fired, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI told him that while I did not want to get fired, I would not resign,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Berman said. The Judiciary Committee interview, which was being transcribed for public release later, comes as the panel deepens its probe of politicization at the Justice Department. Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., has called Berman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dismissal \u00e2\u0080\u009cpart of a clear and dangerous pattern\u00e2\u0080\u009d of behavior by Barr. The panel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Democratic majority is pursuing its investigation of the attorney general, who they say operates more like Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal lawyer than the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top law-enforcement official. Barr is set to testify before the committee later this month. The Southern District, known for its high-profile prosecutions, is where Berman oversaw several ongoing investigations of Trump associates, including some who figured prominently in the House impeachment inquiry of the president. Berman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office is looking into the business dealings of Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal lawyer and a former New York mayor. It has also prosecuted Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s former personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, who went to prison for lying to Congress and campaign-finance crimes and was on Thursday returned to federal prison days after the New York Post published photos of him at a restaurant. The closed-door interview with Berman spanned three hours. He was not expected to disclose information about the investigations into Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s circle, but rather to discuss only his removal, according to a person familiar with the proceeding who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss it. He arrived without a lawyer. The session comes as the Capitol remains partially shut down during the COVID-19 crisis. A handful of lawmakers, but not all of those on the panel, attended. Berman, a registered Republican and reportedly a donor to Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2016 campaign, was tapped by the administration in 2018 as the U.S. attorney for SDNY. He ultimately agreed to step down from his post, but only after being assured his office\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probes of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s circle would continue. As he sat alone before the committee on Thursday, Berman told the panel of the series of events that started with an email from Barr\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office requesting the meeting, apparently on June 18. He said he was not told what it was about. When he arrived at Barr\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel suite the next day, there \u00e2\u0080\u009cwere sandwiches on the table, but nobody ate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Barr told him he wanted to make changes at the office. Berman resisted, saying he \u00e2\u0080\u009cloved\u00e2\u0080\u009d his job and asked if Barr was \u00e2\u0080\u009cdissatisfied\u00e2\u0080\u009d with his performance. Barr assured him the move was solely because SEC head Clayton wanted to relocate to New York and the administration wanted to \u00e2\u0080\u009ckeep him on the team.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Before taking the reins at the SEC, Clayton had been a well-connected Wall Street lawyer who represented and advised a number of major companies, including Goldman Sachs, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and UBS. Back and forth it went on that Friday at the Pierre, with Barr saying the move would be good for Berman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s r\u00c3\u00a9sum\u00c3\u00a9 and eventual return to the private sector, Berman said. Berman would \u00e2\u0080\u009conly have to sit there\u00e2\u0080\u009d for five months until the presidential election determined next steps, Barr said. He told Berman it would be an opportunity to accumulate a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbook of business\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 clients \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to bring to a private firm. As Berman remained unmoved, Barr told him \u00e2\u0080\u009che was trying to think of other jobs in the administration\u00e2\u0080\u009d that might be of interest. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI said that there was no job offer that would entice me to resign from my position,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Berman recalled. Late that Friday the Justice Department issued a statement saying Berman was stepping down, launching the standoff. Berman issued his own statement saying he had \u00e2\u0080\u009cno intention of resigning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He showed up for work Saturday. On Saturday night, Barr publicly released a letter saying he had been fired by the president. At the time, Trump told reporters it was \u00e2\u0080\u009call up to the attorney general,\u00e2\u0080\u009d adding, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t involved.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Berman told the House panel the letter also contained a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccritical concession\u00e2\u0080\u009d from Barr. In it, Barr stated that Berman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand-picked deputy would take over as acting U.S. attorney until the permanent successor was in place. Berman said that with \u00e2\u0080\u009cfull confidence\u00e2\u0080\u009d the work of the office would continue, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI decided to step down and not litigate my removal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Berman had worked from 1987 to 1990 for the independent counsel who investigated the administration of President Ronald Reagan in the Iran-contra affair. He previously served in the SDNY office as an assistant U.S. attorney from 1990 to 1994 before joining private practice, including time at the same firm as Giuliani. He reportedly met with Trump before being assigned as the top federal prosecutor job in Manhattan, after Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ouster of Preet Preet Bharara in 2017. Bharara, a federal prosecutor appointed to the SDNY post by President Barack Obama, announced his own firing in March 2017, shortly after Trump took office. SDNY has probed Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inaugural fundraising and overseen the prosecution of two Florida businessmen, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who were associates of Giuliani and tied to the Ukraine impeachment investigation. The men were charged in October with federal campaign-finance violations. More SDNY news:Jeffrey Epstein confidante Ghislaine Maxwell arrested in New Hampshire"}]}
