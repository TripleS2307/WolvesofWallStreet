The ruling came five months after a new government took power with Najib\u2019s Malay party the biggest bloc in the alliance. His party\u2019s shocking election ouster in 2018 was driven by public anger over the 1MDB scandal. \u201cI find the accused guilty and convict the accused of all seven charges,\u201d Judge Mohamad Nazlan Ghazali said after spending two hours to read out his ruling. Analysts said the ruling would bolster the prosecution\u2019s case in Najib\u2019s other trials and would signal to the business community Malaysia\u2019s legal system has strength in tackling international financial crimes. Najib, 67, has promised to appeal. He has said he was misled by rogue bankers and the case against him is political. \u201cFrom day one, I have said this is the chance for me to clear my name,\u201d\u2033 he wrote on Facebook late Monday. \u201cAfter this, we will go to the Court of Appeal. I am ready.\u201d A scion of one of Malaysia\u2019s most prominent political families, he faces 42 charges in five separate trials and could face years in prison. Najib\u2019s lawyers asked the judge for a delay until next week before they made their arguments on sentencing. The current trial involved a charge of abuse of power, three charges of criminal breach of trust and three money laundering charges. The judge said Najib failed to raise reasonable doubt and that prosecutors had established beyond reasonable doubt that Najib misappropriated money for his own use. \u201cThe conviction would serve as a solid foundation for the prosecution in ensuing IMDB-related trials,\u201d said Oh Ei Sun, a senior fellow with Singapore\u2019s Institute of International Affairs. He said the ruling also would strengthen the credibility of current Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin, who was fired as Najib\u2019s deputy, five years ago to the date of Tuesday\u2019s verdict, for speaking out on the 1MDB scandal, although he now relies on Najib\u2019s party for support. Najib\u2019s party is the biggest bloc in the current Malay nationalist alliance, which was formed in March after Muhyiddin\u2019s party toppled the former reformist government. Najib shortly after taking office in 2009 set up 1MDB to ostensibly accelerate Malaysia\u2019s economic development. But the fund accumulated billions in debt, and U.S. investigators allege that at least $4.5 billion was stolen from it and laundered by Najib\u2019s associates to finance Hollywood films and buy hotels, a luxury yacht, artwork, jewelry and other extravagances. More than $700 million from the fund allegedly landed in Najib\u2019s bank accounts. Najib\u2019s wife and several officials from his party and previous government have also been charged with graft. Najib, whose father and uncles were Malaysia\u2019s second and third prime ministers, denies any wrongdoing. He calls the prosecutions a political attack on him. Najib\u2019s s first trial began in April 2019 over seven charges related to the transfer of 42 million ringgit ($9.8 million) from SRC International, a former 1MDB unit, into his bank accounts through intermediary companies. Najib was accused of using his position to receive a bribe for approving a government guarantee for billions in loans to SRC, committing criminal breach of trust and accepting proceeds from unlawful activities. Evidence showed a complex trail of money through the accounts that paid for renovating Najib\u2019s home, credit card purchases including a Chanel watch bought in Hawaii as a birthday gift for his wife and disbursements to political parties. In defense, Najib has said he was misled by rogue bankers led by Malaysian fugitive financier Low Taek Jho, identified by investigators as a mastermind in the 1MDB saga. The judge found Najib and Low had a close relationship. Najib testified he assumed the money was part of an Arab donation arranged by Low. The judge debunked that argument in the guilty verdict, finding it an \u201celaborate but weak fabrication.\u201d Najib\u2019s lawyers said Low had used the donation as a guise to keep Najib from being suspicious of his plundering of the 1MDB fund. Prosecutors argued that Najib was the real power behind 1MDB and SRC, and called the Arab donation \u201cmanufactured evidence\u201d to cover up his tracks."}]}
