The tactic was part of a broader strategy to grow the business and put more protein alternatives on people\u2019s plates, even as the company\u2019s foodservice business wilted due to COVID-19. \u201c[W]e developed value packs for retailers, offered promotional and reduced pricing at retail to encourage greater consumer trial during a period of higher beef prices, switched food service production lines over to retail products, repacked food service inventory for retail sale, supported our QSR [quick-service restaurant] and food service partners with incremental programs and continued to invest in what our brand stands for by providing free product to first responders and those in need,\u201d said Beyond Meat BYND, +0.80% Chief Executive Ethan Brown on the late Tuesday earnings call, according to FactSet. \u201cMany of these efforts, like the COVID-19 crisis itself, continue. And I\u2019m proud to report that early indications suggest each have been highly effective.\u201d Beyond Meat reported second-quarter revenue of $113.3 million, up 69% from 2019. The company said the rise was driven by an increase in volume sold, though it was partially offset by promotional programs.

The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% has gained 3% for 2020 so far. Besides price, Beyond Meat is showing up at more meals because it launched a new product, Cookout Classic, which was introduced at the end of the quarter and contributed 16 points to year-over-year volume growth, according to Brown. That product is available at Walmart Inc. WMT, +1.00% and Target Corp. TGT, +1.14% Beyond Meat also recently expanded to warehouse club chains Sam\u2019s Club, which is part of Walmart, and BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club Holdings Inc.

Beyond Meat\u2019s breakfast sausage was also recently made available at 650 Wawa convenience store locations, with the remaining 220 coming next week. \u201cThe quarter was not without its messiness but demonstrated the company was able to quickly pivot its supply, distribution and marketing efforts to the retail channel in the face of market challenges,\u201d wrote BTIG analysts led by Peter Saleh. \u201cWhile foodservice will likely remain a headwind for several more quarters, we view the retail sales growth as a testament to demand for the product and believe ample opportunity remains as distribution and product offerings expand.\u201d BTIG rates Beyond Meat stock buy with a $173 price target.

UBS rates Beyond Meat shares sell, but raised its price target $5 to $110. Competitors are forging partnerships of their own, with Impossible Foods beginning the rollout of its product at nearly 2,100 Walmart Supercenters and Neighborhood Markets.

TSN, -1.71% , which originally held a 5% stake in Beyond Meat, reported fiscal third-quarter earnings on Monday, has lowered beef prices during the pandemic after the cost to consumers rose. Tyson\u2019s beef sales fell to $3.65 billion from $4.16 billion last year, though the average price for beef rose 11.6%. \u201cWe saw large supplies of market-ready livestock during the quarter but continued to experience production inefficiencies and lower throughput due to our decisions to temporarily idle some facilities in an effort to protect our team members,\u201d said Samuel Dean Banks, president of Tyson Foods, on the earnings call, according to a FactSet transcript. Banks has been named the chief executive of Tyson Foods, effective October 3. Tyson announced on July 30 that it has created a new role, chief medical officer, and has added nurses to the staff as part of a new COVID-19 monitoring program.
