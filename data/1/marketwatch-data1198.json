Trump said it would be up to Attorney General William Barr to issue any charges, but hinted that the matter would end up in court. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens. They\u2019re in court \u2014 or they\u2019ll soon be in court,\u201d Trump said about the book, set to be released early next week. The president accused Bolton of not completing a pre-publication review to make sure the book does not contain classified material. That contradicts statements from Bolton\u2019s attorney, Chuck Cooper, who says his client worked painstakingly for months with classification specialists at the White House National Security Council to make changes to avoid releasing classified material. Barr echoed Trump\u2019s accusation. During an event at the White House, the attorney general said administration officials who have access to sensitive information typically sign non-disclosure agreements that require them to go through a clearance process before they can publish something based on information they accessed in the job. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe that Bolton went through that process \u2014 hasn\u2019t completed the process \u2014 and, therefore, is in violation of that agreement,\u201d Barr said. The Trump administration is \u201ctrying to get them to complete the process \u2014 go through the process \u2014 and make the necessary deletions of classified information,\u201d Barr said. Bolton\u2019s book, \u201cThe Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir,\u201d was supposed to be released in March. Its release date was twice delayed and it is now set to be released next week by publisher Simon & Schuster. \u201cBolton covers an array of topics \u2014 chaos in the White House, sure, but also assessments of major players, the president\u2019s inconsistent, scattershot decision-making process, and his dealings with allies and enemies alike, from China, Russia, Ukraine, North Korea, Iran, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany,\u201d according to the publisher. \u201cI am hard-pressed to identify any significant Trump decision during my tenure that wasn\u2019t driven by reelection calculations,\u201d Bolton writes in the book, according to a news release from the publisher. In a recent op-ed published in The Wall Street Journal, Cooper accused the White House of using the pre-publication review process as a way to protect the president from embarrassment. He said he sent Bolton\u2019s manuscript to classification specialist Ellen Knight on Dec. 30, 2019. Knight and Bolton, who was Trump\u2019s national security adviser for 18 months ending Sept. 10, 2019, spent nearly four months going through the nearly 500-page book multiple times, \u201coften line by line,\u201d Cooper said. In a March 27 letter, Knight thanked Bolton for his efforts to address the classification issues, but said additional edits were required to ensure national security information was protected. She outlined her concerns in 17 single-spaced pages of typed comments, Cooper said. He said Bolton worked through that weekend and sent Knight a response the following Monday. Bolton accepted most of Knight\u2019s suggestions and proposed alternative solutions to others, Cooper said. In mid-April, after resolving a shorter list of remaining issues, it appeared that the pre-publication review process had been finalized. Yet when Bolton asked for a letter confirming his book was cleared for publication, Cooper said his client was told his book had prompted \u201cvery delicate\u201d interactions at the White House and there remained \u201csome internal process considerations to work through.\u201d Knight said she thought the letter might be ready soon, but more than six weeks later, Bolton still hasn\u2019t received it. On June 8, Bolton got a letter from John Eisenberg, the president\u2019s deputy counsel for national security, who claimed that Bolton\u2019s manuscript still contained classified information and that publishing the book would violate his nondisclosure agreements. \u201cThis is a transparent attempt to use national security as a pretext to censor Mr. Bolton, in violation of his constitutional right to speak on matters of the utmost public import,\u201d according to Cooper. \u201cThis attempt will not succeed, and Mr. Bolton\u2019s book will be published June 23.\u201d"}]}
