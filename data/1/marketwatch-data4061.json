The 87-year-old Ginsburg, who spent time in the hospital this week for a possible infection, said her treatment so far has succeeded in reducing lesions on her liver and that she will continue chemotherapy sessions every two weeks. \u201cI have often said I would remain a member of the Court as long as I can do the job full steam. I remain fully able to do that,\u201d Ginsburg said in a statement issued by the court. She said her recent hospitalizations, including one in May, were unrelated to the cancer. A medical scan in February revealed growths on her liver, she said, and she began chemotherapy in May. \u201cMy most recent scan on July 7 indicated significant reduction of the liver lesions and no new disease,\u201d she said. \u201cI am tolerating chemotherapy well and am encouraged by the success of my current treatment.\u201d Ginsburg, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton and joined the court in 1993, has been treated four times for cancer. In addition to the tumor on her pancreas last year, she was previously treated for colorectal cancer in 1999 and pancreatic cancer in 2009. She had lung surgery to remove cancerous growths in December 2018."}]}
