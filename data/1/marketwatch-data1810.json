Oracle co-founder and Chairman Larry Ellison hosted a Trump fundraiser earlier this year, and Trump has voiced support for Oracle taking over TikTok. \u201cI want to make sure you understand that we will be making no comments regarding the press reports about TikTok, so there\u2019s no need to ask,\u201d Catz said at the beginning of the call. Shares, which had surged as much as 6%, were last up around 3.5% after hours, following a 0.3% decline in the regular session to close at $56.80."}]}
