AMC, -2.17% soared 17% in the extended session Tuesday after it and Universal Filmed Entertainment Group UFEG, a division of Comcast Corp. CMCSA, -0.99%, announced a multi-year agreement in which Universal movies will be shown at AMC Theatres for 2 1/2 weeks before they go online. Under the deal, the so-called \"theatrical window\" will be shortened to 17 days from the current 75. For consumers, that means instead of waiting 2 1/2 months to watch a new movie at home, they will be able to see at least some titles just 2 1/2 weeks after they premiere in theaters. The deal settles a dispute between the companies over how soon new films should be allowed to appear on digital platforms. AMC shares are down 43% in 2020; the broader S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% is down 0.4% this year."}]}
