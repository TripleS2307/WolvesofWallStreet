In July, an immigrant laborer in Arkansas lost his father, who had been a poultry-plant worker, to COVID-19. The 30-year-old son also contracted the deadly disease, ended up hospitalized but survived. However, the illness cost him weeks of pay, while he battled for his life against the infection. Now, the man, who declined to use his name for this article for fear of potentially losing his job and jeopardizing his U.S. legal status, is back at work, in manufacturing near Springdale, Ark. He is one of an estimated 55 million essential workers on America\u2019s frontlines, and he doesn\u2019t know how long he can keep paying the loan on his dad\u2019s Corolla at its 16% interest rate. \u201cIt\u2019s all my dad left,\u201d he told MarketWatch via an interpreter. \u201cI can barely make the payment.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s one of the issues that\u2019s been compiling into a big crisis,\u201d said Margarita Solorzano, executive director at the Hispanic Women\u2019s Organization of Arkansas, a 20-year-old nonprofit in Springdale, which has provided emergency aid to families struggling to make car payments, keep up with rent and put food on the table, seven months into the the global viral outbreak. \u201cOwning a car is a must,\u201d she said. Springdale is an industrial hub tucked in the state\u2019s northwest corner with about 81,000 residents. It also sits deep in the Ozarks, where many workers earn minimum wage and public transportation remains scarce. Hispanics make up nearly 40% of the town\u2019s population, a far greater proportion than most any other part of the state. But in a lot of ways, Springdale also could be any town in America \u2014 where the toll of the worst public-health crisis in a century has hit Latinos, Blacks and other ethnic minorities the hardest. \u201cA lot are considered essential workers,\u201d Solorzano said of families in northwest Arkansas seeking aid from her group and others, which aim to help families hurt by the economic and public-health shocks of COVID-19, particularly where federal aid has fallen short. Several auto dealerships peppered throughout the town offered initial loan extensions to borrowers facing hardships, according to Solorzano, but so-called buy-here, pay-here subprime lenders often repossess vehicles quicker than other lenders. Then there\u2019s the man who\u2019s been making payments on his dad\u2019s Toyota, even though he\u2019s unsure he can claim title to the vehicle, since it\u2019s not under his name. The dealer who sold the car to the family a few years ago hasn\u2019t been helpful, he said. \u201cRight now, they are close to paying for the car,\u201d Solorzano said, adding that she\u2019s been working with the son and his mother try to find ways to keep the car. \u201cBut since no one else is on the contract, they are wondering what will happen.\u201d \u201c \u2018People will go without food and the medicines they need to hold on to a car. \u2018 \u201d \u2014 Rosemary Shahan Echos of \u201908 Families often find out the hard way that auto debt can fall into an administrative morass similar to the one that ensnared millions of homeowners during the 2007-\u201908 financial crisis. Rosemary Shahan said paperwork problems, including delayed vehicle registrations and title woes, can leave unsuspecting buyers in the lurch down the road. It\u2019s often those who relied on dealerships to take loans out on used vehicles, something Shahan, a consumer advocate who founded California-based nonprofit Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety in the 1980s, never recommends. Those problems often get worse during downturns. Shahan pointed to a vicious cycle of predatory auto lending and repossessions that has been around for decades. \u201cNow it\u2019s on steroids,\u201d she told MarketWatch. \u201cPeople will go without food and the medicines they need to hold on to a car.\u201dLow wages, high stakes Government studies show that essential workers have been coping with higher odds of contracting the virus and dying because of their jobs, but also with the fear they\u2019ll bring it home to their families. Some of Springdale\u2019s largest local employers are a school district, Tyson Foods TSN, -1.71%, which is based there, and retail giant Walmart WMT, +1.00%, founded about 40 years ago in the town of Rogers, which is just about 10 miles north. In the early months of the pandemic, COVID-19 ravaged U.S. meat and poultry plants, forcing many to temporarily close. That prompted a national food-shortage scare, compelling President Donald Trump to sign an executive order to keep workers on the line and meatpacking plants open.

Marshallese are Pacific islanders who immigrated to Arkansas after the U.S. in the 1980s granted free travel and work privileges to citizens of the Marshall Islands. Many work in the poultry plants, earning starting wages of about $13 an hour, but often also pay up to 20% interest rates on marked-up used vehicles, which have gone through multiple cycles of repossessions with previous owners, Latior said. Even the hint of COVID-19 exposure can spell financial ruin. That\u2019s partially because anyone suspected of exposure to the novel strain of coronavirus faces a two-week quarantine, which will restart if anyone else in a household has a similar scare on the job. Test results also have been known to take about 14 days, he said, which adds up to some workers going a month or longer before collecting any back pay. \u201cI know of more than 30 families that got a car repossessed,\u201d Latior told MarketWatch. \u201cThey can\u2019t miss a car payment.\u201d To help families get by, Latior helped raise nearly $50,000 in emergency funds through the nearby Good Shepherd Lutheran Church in Fayetteville. In August, Latior and the Rev. Clint Schnekloth went around to local car dealers to make auto payments in person and help Marshallese families get caught up on their loans.

Clint Schnekloth The relief, unlike the pandemic, has been short-lived. \u201cOn my list are almost 300 families asking for help with car payments,\u201d Latior said. Tyson told MarketWatch it responded to the pandemic by boosting its support for workers, including by increasing short-term disability pay and medical benefits, as well as handing out a one-time $1,000 bonus to about 71% of its nearly 141,000 employees. It gave about another $6 million in personal hardship assistance. As part of its third-quarter earnings, Tyson disclosed that $114 million of \u201cthank-you bonuses to frontline employees,\u201d was offset partially by credits from the landmark $2 trillion Cares Act passed by Congress in March to help shore up households, businesses and cities during the pandemic. Walmart said it has given employees $1.1 billion in special bonuses this year and extended emergency leave. But Deeksha Gupta said government help hasn\u2019t been targeted enough for many communities, particularly marginalized groups experiencing higher rates of coronavirus infections and deaths. While the Cares Act provided a temporary income windfall and forbearance protections for home loans with government backing, no similar relief has been granted on the auto front. \u201cThat\u2019s one reason why collection practices are ongoing,\u201d said Gupta, an assistant professor of finance at Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Tepper School of Business, who wrote a July working paper with Tetiana Davydiuk that found that low-income workers, particularly in Black communities with higher debt burdens, often couldn\u2019t afford to reduce their mobility and stay at home during the pandemic.Auto debt haunts for life Also, unlike swaths of the mortgage market, auto loans typically are recourse, meaning a lender can sue a borrower and often garnish wages for any remaining defaulted loan balance \u2014 even after a car gets repossessed and a borrower owes more on a vehicle than it\u2019s worth on paper. \u201cThe car was just bait,\u201d Shahan, the consumer advocate, said of lenders using predatory practices. Already, the boom in subprime auto lending over the past decade had been a key concern among regulators focused on what sectors might fare the worst during the next downturn. But as far as scrutinizing subprime auto industry practices, it\u2019s been states\u2019 top legal officers leading the charge, including by extracting legal settlements from large and small lenders. That work continues. In August, the Massachusetts attorney general filed a lawsuit against Credit Acceptance Corp CACC, -0.73%, one of the nation\u2019s largest subprime auto lenders. The AG claimed that Credit Acceptance knew \u201cwell over 50% of high-risk low-score borrowers would default, typically a little more than a year into their loans,\u201d and also claimed the lender has engaged in unfair collection and repossession practices since at least 2013. Credit Acceptance disclosed in August that about 40 state attorneys general, including from Arkansas and the District of Columbia, have been investigating the company. It didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment for this article.Wall Street\u2019s role There were $250 billion of outstanding subprime auto loans that Wall Street packaged into bond deals and sold to investors at the end of 2019, or about 18.8% of all U.S. auto loans, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. Proceeds from bond sales help lenders keep making new loans. Already this year, $21.6 billion of subprime auto bonds have been issued, according to Finsight data, which roughly is in line with annual issuance over recent years, despite it being the worst U.S. economic downturn since World War II. During the \u201908 crisis, subprime auto loans largely held up as borrowers clung to their vehicles as a lifeline to a job. In recent months, subprime auto-bond loan delinquency rates have dipped below levels from a year prior, according to Goldman Sachs data. But that resilience largely has been attributed to one-time stimulus checks and $600 in extra weekly unemployment befits, which expired in July. \u201cThe longer Congress and the president delays in coming up with another relief package, the longer this pandemic-induced recession will be prolonged,\u201d said Brian Marks, an economics and business analytics lecturer at the University of New Haven. What\u2019s more, messy loan-document practices uncovered during the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis often led to a temporarily reprieve for many underwater homeowners who stopped paying their lenders, but continued to stay in their homes. The opposite has been the case in subprime auto finance, where a car with late payments or a title lien can be immobilized and repossessed, sometimes within hours of a missed payment. \u201cI do believe the good news is going to end,\u201d said Joseph Cioffi, chair of law firm Davis & Gilbert\u2019s insolvency and creditor\u2019s rights practice, of the strong performance of subprime auto loans so far during the pandemic. After all, COVID-19 led many car factories to temporary shut down production and consumers to race out and buy used cars to avoid public transportation. But that\u2019s also meant lenders now have great incentive to swiftly repossess vehicles and refill their lots. \u201cSubprime auto borrowers, right now, they are in a very vulnerable spot,\u201d Cioffi said."}]}
