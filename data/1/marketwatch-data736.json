The more rugged looks give it more traditional SUV flair. In addition to its standard model and conventional Hybrid, Toyota has also added off-road capability with its Adventure and TRD Pro packages. Also see: These 3 EVs are the lowest cost to own over 5 years But the most significant change comes with the 2021 RAV4 Prime plug-in hybrid (PHEV). Its returned 4-cylinder engine combined with a more powerful lithium-ion battery pack and three motors (two on the front axle and one in the rear) makes AWD standard. Total system output is 302 horsepower, making the Prime that most powerful and quickest (0-60 mph in 5.7 seconds) of all the RAV4 models. It also boasts 42 miles of pure electric range and offers several available firsts for RAV4, including 19-inch wheels and a head-up display.Driving the 2021 Toyota RAV4 Prime The 2021 RAV4 Prime has a similar feel and responsiveness as the standard RAV4 Hybrid. The big difference here is the additional noticeable output from the powertrain, which makes 302 horsepower in total. Toyota says the extra 83 horsepower over the hybrid is responsible for 0-60 mph acceleration of 5.7 seconds. The RAV4 steps quickly off the line in either its pure electric or hybrid mode and easily cruises at highway speeds without feeling winded. While Toyota says the vehicle can travel 42 miles as an EV, we were able to wring nearly 46 miles out of a full-charge before the engine kicked in. The electric-assist power steering feels natural, and Toyota has figured out the interplay between regenerative braking and hydraulic-assist stopping power to provide a balanced and linear feel when you depress the brake pedal. There's a nice balance between the RAV4's operation in both pure electric and hybrid mode that speaks well to Toyota's commitment to refinement.Favorite features Plug-in hybrid powertrain:\u00e2\u0080\u00a8The new PHEV setup provides at least 42 miles of pure electric operation that blends smoothly with the vehicle's conventional hybrid powertrain.
