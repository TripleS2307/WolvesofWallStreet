Speaking at the White House, Meadows said negotiations with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will continue Friday and that there would be \"perhaps an in-person meeting tomorrow on Capitol Hill.\" Meadows spoke a day after Democrats rejected the administration\u2019s offer of a short-term extension of the $600 weekly unemployment benefit. Experts have said the failure to renew the benefit last week meant it was practically impossible for the add-on to be extended without a gap, even if lawmakers acted by formal expiration date of July 31."}]}
