The U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service sent out Economic Impact Payments as prepaid debit cards to roughly 2 million Americans in May. Problem is, many taxpayers still waiting for their cut of the $2.2 trillion CARES Act didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get the message that they should be expecting to get their stimulus money in the form of an EIP Card, as opposed to a paper check. And the IRS is concerned that people may have thrown them out, as many of the stimulus debit cards it mailed out last month still haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been activated. So now people who have still not received their Economic Impact Payments should be keeping an eye out for new letters from the IRS, the revenue service announced Thursday, which will notify them that they may have an unactivated prepaid EIP card. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese new letters, like the prepaid cards, are not a scam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the IRS emphasized in a new announcement on Thursday, which included images of what the envelope looks like (see here), as well as a sample letter (see here). Anyone who has not received the card, or who has accidentally thrown it out, should call 800-240-8100. If the letter you receive has a different phone number on it, the IRS warned, then it is likely a scam. \u201c Anyone who has not received the card, or who has accidentally thrown it out, should call 800-240-8100. \u201d So why the confusion over these cards? Well, these Visa cards are being issued by MetaBank (the Treasury\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial agent) and delivered in plain envelopes from Money Network Cardholder Services \u00e2\u0080\u0094 neither of which is a familiar name for most of us. So reports of people mistaking these for preapproved credit-card junk mail, or even a scam, have popped up across the country. And, in some cases, people have even thrown away the debit cards containing their long-awaited stimulus money before they realized their mistake.

They told local CBS VIAC, -2.34% affiliate WINK-TV that they chucked their EIP Card because they were expecting a stimulus check from the U.S. Treasury. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy husband looked at it, briefly read it and he said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Do you want this?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And I said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need another fake card,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 so he cut it up in little pieces,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bonnie Moore said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe next thing you see is I am in the garbage can trying to pull out all of the pieces together, which did not work.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Their neighbor also told the outlet that he found his prepaid debit card suspicious because it bore no official federal insignia, and the return address was in Omaha, Neb. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDoesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sound like the federal government to me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.

But the IRS has tweeted \u00e2\u0080\u009creminders\u00e2\u0080\u009d that \u00e2\u0080\u009cmillions of people are getting Economic Impact Payments by prepaid debit card mailed in plain envelopes from Money Network Cardholder Services.\u00e2\u0080\u009d iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more, the IRS recently issued a press release with the subject line: \u00e2\u0080\u009cEconomic Impact Payments being sent by prepaid debit cards, arrive in plain envelope.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It also answered several \u00e2\u0080\u009cfrequently asked questions\u00e2\u0080\u009d about the cards, such as how the cards could be used without fees.

Among the dissatisfied customers complaining online about getting a debit card instead of a direct deposit or a check were those saying they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d prefer, and expected, a payment form that they could more easily cash or deposit into a bank account: iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } The Internal Revenue Service had distributed more than 128 million checks and paid over $218 billion by early May. This includes $1,200 payments to individuals with adjusted gross income below $75,000 and $2,400 to married couples filing taxes jointly who earn under $150,000, with payouts prorated above those income thresholds.

Nearly 4 million people will receive a prepaid debit card instead of a paper check, which was determined by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, another part of the Treasury Department that works with the IRS to handle distribution of the payments. In some cases, people who qualified for an Economic Impact Payment, but whose bank account information was not on file with the IRS, received a debit card in lieu of a check or a direct deposit. How will I receive my card, and what does it look like? The EIP Cards are being sent to the most recent mailing address filed with the IRS. The cards will arrive in a plain envelope from Money Network Cardholder Services.

You can withdraw cash at ATMs, get cash-back from participating merchants, or withdraw cash from a bank or credit union. But only some of these methods are free, and there are some limits to how much cash you can take at once.

Then you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll ask the teller for the amount that you would like to withdraw. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a $2,500 per transaction and per day limit, although the bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s limit may also be less. What if I just want to transfer my balance into my bank account?

But you will be charged $2 for withdrawing money from out-of-network ATMS \u00e2\u0080\u0094 after your first ATM withdrawal.

Perhaps most importantly, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a $7.50 fee to reissue a lost or stolen card. It will be shipped in seven to 10 business days after the reissue order is placed. If you want that card to be sent four to seven days after the order is placed, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a $17 priority shipping fee. Will the government be tracking what I spend the money on? No. Under the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the federal government is not allowed to ask the card issuer about your EIP Card account, and the card issuer is not allowed to give the government information about your EIP Card account without your written permission, except under very limited circumstances.So these cards aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a scam \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but what IRS scams should I watch out for? Be warned that the IRS will never call, text, email or reach out to you over social media to say it needs more information to process a payment. The same goes for banks and credit unions.
