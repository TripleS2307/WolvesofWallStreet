He said he now expected an unemployment rate in a range of 9%-10% at the end of the year. That is up from his earlier forecast of 8% year-end unemployment rate. The unemployment rate was at 11.1% in June and estimates are for July to show a 10.5% rate, according to an average estimate of economists polled by MarketWatch. The Labor Department will release the July employment report on Friday morning. Economists are worried that the strong pace of job growth seen over the past two months may have faded last month. Kaplan is a voting member of the Fed's interest-rate committee this year. In the interview, Kaplan said that he didn't think there needed to be a shutdown of the economy to get the coronavirus pandemic under control. On Sunday, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said a four- or six-week shutdown \"could get the case count down so that our testing and our contract tracing was actually enough to control\" the virus. Kaplan said that if all Americans wore masks, the virus could be managed. He said there may be some communities where lockdowns are needed. \"I think we're going to have to learn to live with this virus. We're going to have to learn to reengage in our daily activities, but still control the virus,\" he added. Stocks opened higher on Monday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56%  climbing near midday trade."}]}
