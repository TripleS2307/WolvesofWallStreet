Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how this will likely play out on Election Day", "body": "\u201c The 2016 election has left many voters in 2020 with polling PTSD. \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe only poll that matters is the one on Election Day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This election adage gets tossed out pretty much every time a new political poll drops \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a product of the many election night surprises seen over the years, where the winner of the election ended up being the loser of the polls.\u00c2 This is exactly what happened in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, when key Midwestern states in the Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u009cBlue Wall\u00e2\u0080\u009d consistently produced leads for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump that were well outside of the margins of error, but where Trump ended up with narrow victories \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a trifecta of upsets for the record books.\u00c2 The 2016 election has left many voters in 2020 with polling PTSD. During the Democratic primary period, Joe Biden, now the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presumptive nominee and then one of only two Democratic prospects with name recognition high enough to conduct head-to-head ballot tests against President Trump, enjoyed on average a\u00c2 4.5-point advantage against Trump\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 just outside most survey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s margins of error.\u00c2 Had the dynamics of the race stayed there, Democratic hand-wringing and poll-doubting would no doubt still be quite intense. At that time only\u00c2 my forecasting model\u00c2 was confident of a Biden victory in November\u00e2\u0080\u0099s general election. But a once-a-century global pandemic has altered American life, sent the U.S. economy into a tailspin, and tested America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cchaos president\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a test many voters now say Trump is failing.\u00c2 Indeed, Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mismanagement of the U.S. response to the coronavirus pandemic has accomplished the seemingly impossible in this polarized era: It has spurred a seismic shift in voter preferences among independents. What was a\u00c2 13-point advantage\u00c2 for Trump among independents in the\u00c2 YouGov/Economist\u00c2 tracking panel of registered voters in March is currently a\u00c2 9-point Biden advantage\u00c2 in their most recent poll \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a total swing of 22 points.\u00c2 \u201c A new anxiety is seeping in among Democrats \u00e2\u0080\u0094 what if it happens again?\u00c2 \u201d In poll after poll, Biden now holds double-digit leads nationally in head-to-head contests against Trump, along with robust leads in an ever-expanding map of swing states. In some ways, it feels like 2016 again. With less than 100 days before the 2020 election, a new anxiety is seeping in among Democrats \u00e2\u0080\u0094 what if it happens again?\u00c2 It, of course, refers to the 2016 election night shock of seeing states like Wisconsin, long marked \u00e2\u0080\u009csafe\u00e2\u0080\u009d for Clinton, instead popping into vibrant GOP red on whichever election tracker you were using that night. Though the public has a general sense of \"the polls got it wrong in 2016,\u00e2\u0080\u009d few voters understand what specifically went wrong.\u00c2 Although it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a complex topic with many moving parts and contributing elements, three major factors generally contribute to election night surprises. The most common explanation is a sudden, last-minute shift in voter preferences, which, while rare, certainly can happen. More likely though, what looks like a last-minute preference change is usually the product of a decent number of undecided voters coming down the stretch who break decisively against the candidate who has been leading in the polls, causing that lead to reverse at the ballot box.\u00c2 This is partly what happened in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania in 2016.\u00c2 Although over-representation of college-educated voters in the Midwest state surveys impacted polling estimates in these states, atypically high third-party and write-in balloting, combined with abnormally high numbers of undecided voters who then\u00c2 broke disproportionately for Trump, played a big role in America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s election night surprise.\u00c2 A polling autopsy I conducted on 2016 polls for my\u00c2 book on the 2016 election\u00c2 revealed how clear a signal in the aggregated polling data these atypically large numbers of undecided voters were sending out \u00e2\u0080\u0094 one that in retrospect should have been obvious. In fact,\u00c2 Nate Silver of 538.com did cite a high percentage of undecideds as a factor for why his election model was slightly more generous to Trump than others.\u00c2 Undecided voters decide elections To illustrate just how high the number of undecideds were in 2016, and how atypical this was, consider that at the end of October 2012 just 5% of voters remained undecided in their presidential choice.\u00c2 In 2016 that percentage tripled to 15%. Meaning that instead of a forgone conclusion for Clinton, the narrative for the 2016 election should have been that \u00e2\u0080\u009canything can happen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The failure wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the polls \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but in how they were interpreted.\u00c2 Pollsters, and those who covered them, generally failed to notice or at least greatly minimized a clear signal in the 2016 data \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the unusually high numbers of voters breaking for the third party or write-in option. Due to variation in the way pollsters deal with voters who indicate a choice that is not one of the two party nominees or undecided, this was a noisier signal than the \"undecided\" signal. One of the reasons people, myself included, were dismissive\u00c2 of such \"protest voting\" data is the well-known and well-documented tendency for third-party support to be overstated in polls. But third-party balloting, especially factoring in the historically high 2016 write-in ballots, was on average, three times higher than in the past four presidential election cycles. In Wisconsin, for example, where Trump won by just 0.7 of a point, almost 7% of the electorate cast \"protest\" ballots.\u00c2 \u201c Democrats and left-leaning independents are more likely to vote since Trump got elected. \u00c2 \u201d A second source of poll-result disconnect occurs when the electorate ends up \u00e2\u0080\u009clooking different\u00e2\u0080\u009d than what pollsters modeled. In 2016, pollsters expected an electorate that was slightly more diverse and younger than the one that ended up casting ballots, especially in cities like Detroit, Philadelphia, and Milwaukee. Pollsters weight surveys to reflect anticipated turnout \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the demographic composition of the electorate that actually shows up to vote \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in terms of race, gender, age, and education. This can lead to overestimates of Democratic candidate support, which is why Clinton failed to capture the White House, and why Democrats across the Senate and House maps underperformed despite strong poll numbers. Sometimes when good polls go bad, it's because of a significant, aggregate voter behavior change pollsters fail to anticipate, or anticipate fully, such as the massive voter turnout surges\u00c2 that have erupted in elections since 2016 as a backlash to Trump. These turnout surges form the foundation of my election forecasting work: the American electorate is changing significantly due to \u00e2\u0080\u009cnegative partisanship,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which argues that along with positive emotions about their own political party, partisans experience negative emotions about the opposition party, particularly hate and fear. Applying negative partisanship to voting behavior shows that Democrats and left-leaning independents are more likely to vote since Trump got elected. \u00c2 2020 polling is sending clear signals Another major source of poll-result disconnect occurs because of the way polls are interpreted. Most of this confusion ties back to what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s called the \u00e2\u0080\u009cmargin of error.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2 Margin of error introduces error estimates ranging from 3-to-5 points. Polls inside the margin of error, unless they are stretched\u00c2 to\u00c2 the outside bands of it, should only be characterized as \u00e2\u0080\u009ctoss-ups.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2 So, what if a candidate has a lead of say 8- or 9-points, which is well outside of the margin of error, and it is a consistent\u00c2 finding across multiple polls? Should the polls be trusted?\u00c2 This is, of course, exactly where the Trump vs. Biden polling is right now. And as in 2016, the 2020 polling is sending clear signals.\u00c2 The \u00e2\u0080\u009cDems in Disarray\u00e2\u0080\u009d issue of 2016 has been replaced with early signs of solid party unity as Democrats rally around Biden. Already,\u00c2 91% of Democrats indicate they plan to vote for him.\u00c2 In 2016 after Bernie Sanders ceded the presidential nomination to Clinton,\u00c2 just 84% of Democrats had rallied behind her \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an ominous sign of the trouble to come and another clear signal from polling data that we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take seriously, though in context, Republicans were also having \"rallying\" issues at that time. Although it is early, my\u00c2 Lincoln Project\u00c2 colleagues are working hard to chip away at Trump's support among Republicans, which has dipped to\u00c2 88% in the latest YouGov/Economist poll.\u00c2 The 2020 election also stands in stark contrast to 2016 in terms of how many undecided voters there are. Few voters are on the sidelines in an election with stakes for the future of the country as high as the election of 1860. Compared to 2016\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 15% undecided voter pool, a scant 4% of voters now report being \u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot sure\u00e2\u0080\u009d who they will vote for, according to\u00c2 YouGov/Economist polling, which I should emphasize is polling registered voters and is not yet imposing any type of likely voter modeling. These are sure signs that voters know what side they are on in this election, which with the addition of the pandemic has become a referendum\u00c2 on America herself.\u00c2 Another key difference from 2016 is that voters hate one presidential candidate far more than the other. Granted, in this polarized era, it's all but impossible to be loved in the political arena. A more achievable goal is to be less vilified than your opponent. Not only does Biden come out neutral, or close to it, on the net favorability ratio compared to Trump's massive net deficit, but among voters who say they dislike both candidates, the Democrats have the edge:\u00c2 Biden is heavily favored over Trump.\u00c2 Read: AP-NORC poll finds just 32% approve of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s handling of pandemic Plus: Trump plays on fears in campaign for suburbs This fall will bring us hundreds of polls, on the presidential race as well as competitive Senate and House races. In terms of polling, we've never had access to more data, and other than\u00c2 challenges pollsters face getting people to take surveys, polling has never been more sophisticated or better executed.\u00c2 Pollsters, and the people who consume polls can mitigate polling \"surprises\" by demystifying polls and familiarizing themselves with the capabilities, and the limitations, of horse race\u00c2 polling. As much as pundits and the media will hate to hear this, the hard truth is that in races where polls put the candidates competing within the margin of error, the only statistically\u00c2 valid conclusion is that the race is highly competitive. With better education as to the statistical limitations of polling data, there would be far fewer Election Day surprises. With great polling comes great responsibility to convey its limitations and not to oversell its capabilities.\u00c2 Rachel\u00c2 Bitecofer\u00c2 is the\u00c2 election forecaster\u00c2 and senior fellow at\u00c2 The Niskanen Center, host of\u00c2 The Election Whisperer podcast, and senior adviser to The Lincoln Project.
