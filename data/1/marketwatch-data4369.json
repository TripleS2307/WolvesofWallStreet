Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina and Texas are seeing infections climb, according to a Washington Post analysis. The news comes a day after Vice President Mike Pence said in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that worries about a second wave of cases later in the year were \u201coverblown\u201d and due to the media trying to scare Americans. His comments were dismissed by health care experts, who continue to urge people to wear face masks, wash their hands frequently and socially distance to avoid further economic hardship and unnecessary deaths. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } \u201cDr. Pence would not be someone I\u2019d go to for a medical checkup, or for medical advice,\u201d said Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic minority leader Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, said he would not be attending the rally in Tusla, Oklahoma planned for Saturday by President Donald Trump, telling the Daily Beast that he is in the high-risk category given he is 79 years old. Fauci also said the current talk of a second wave of infections is redundant as the U.S. is still dealing with the first wave. \u201cWe are seeing infections to a greater degree than they had previously seen in certain states, including states in the southwest and in the south,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cI don\u2019t like to talk about a second wave right now, because we haven\u2019t gotten out of our first wave.\u201d See also:\u2018We\u2019re still in a first wave,\u2019 Fauci says, noting precautions can prevent second wave of coronavirus Fauci said he is nervous about states that are reopening aggressively, especially when he sees images on TV of people gathering closely in bars with no masks. Regarding the Tulsa rally, he said outside is better than inside, no crowd is better than a crowd, and a crowd is \u201cbetter than big crowd.\u201d The Trump campaign is planning to hold the rally indoors in a 19,000-seat arena, that has canceled all other events through the end of July. The campaign has acknowledged the risk of infection by insisting that those who attend sign legal waivers absolving Trump and his staff of any blame, if people get sick or are injured. The virus is spread by droplets of moisture that are released when people cough, sing or shout and it moves rapidly in indoor spaces. Trump rallies tend to include a lot of cheering, shouting and chanting. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released its guidelines for reopening safely on Friday, and identified the highest risk of spreading the virus as stemming from, \u201clarge in-person gatherings where it is difficult for individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and attendees travel from outside the local area.\u201d See:Considerations for Daily Life and Considerations for Events and Gatherings A group of Tulsa city residents and business owners filed a suit seeking to bar Trump from hosting the rally, but their suit was denied by a judge, according to media reports.

At least 4.0 million people have recovered. The U.S. has the highest case tally in the world at 2.15 million and the highest death toll at 117,290. Brazil is second with 923,189 cases and 45,241 deaths. The U.K. has 300,715 cases and 42,238 fatalities, the highest in Europe and the third highest in the world. A chart published Wednesday by Our World in Data was the subject of social media buzz, as it showed the difference in the rolling three-day average of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the European Union and the U.S. EU countries moved faster to enforce restrictions on movement when the pandemic first created hot spots in Spain and Italy and has made far greater progress in flattening its infection curve than the U.S. The EU has a population of 446 million, compared with the U.S. population of about 330 million. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } China, where the illness was first reported late last year, is introducing further restrictions on movement in Beijing, a city of about 21.5 million, after a fresh cluster of cases that is understood to be linked to a wholesale food market. Officials have barred unessential travel, canceled hundreds of flights and suspended schools, the Guardian reported. Health authorities reported 31 new cases of COVID-19 as of Tuesday, bringing the total number of new infections to 137 in just six days. The outbreak could cause more disruption than the initial one in the city of Wuhan, which has a population of 11 million. See: Beijing cancels 60% of flights to contain fresh coronavirus outbreaks: report \u201cA lockdown of Beijing would be a Wuhan on steroids, being a governmental and commercial centre of China, and much more massive on any measure then Wuhan,\u201d said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst, Asia Pacific, at foreign exchange services company OANDA. \u201cThe economic implications would be profound in China, and by default, the rest of Asia.\u201d See: Coronavirus tally: Global cases of COVID-19 at 8.19 million, 444,076 deaths and 6 U.S. states see record new casesWhat\u2019s the economy saying? There was good news for the housing market on Wednesday in numbers from the Commerce Department, showing construction of new houses rose 4.3% in May. Housing starts climbed to an annual rate of 974,000 last month from a five-year low of 934,000 in April, to mark the first increase since January. Construction rose as the reopening U.S. economy and ultra-low mortgage rates drew buyers and spurred builders to speed up work. Economists polled by MarketWatch forecasted starts to rise to a 1.13 million rate. That\u2019s how many new homes would be built in a year if the level of construction was the same each month. Although the increase was less than expected, a sharp rise in builder permits indicates construction is on track to expand more rapidly soon. Permits to build new houses jumped 14.4 % to a 1.22 million annual pace.

And that will be the biggest constraint on stronger housing activity,\u201d said senior economist Jennifer Lee of BMO Capital Markets. What are companies saying? U.S. Steel Corp. X, -1.99% disappointed investors with the news that its second-quarter losses would be much worse than expected after a \u201csignificant\u201d portion\u201d of steelmaking operations have been idled during the quarter as a result of the pandemic. The company reiterated its view that the second quarter will mark the bottom for the year, with demand starting to show improvement in June. Results for the company\u2019s flat-rolled business are expected to be \u201csignificantly lower\u201d than the first quarter as a result of the pandemic, but demand has begun improving. The tubular business remains \u201cchallenged,\u201d however, with demand for welded and seamless pipe declining significantly, as rig counts continue to decline and oil prices remain low. There was better news from mattress company Tempur Sealy International Inc. TPX, +1.16% , which reported a strong rebound in orders in May and early June after a \u201cvery difficult\u201d April. See: COVID-19 will force older workers into early retirement \u201cThis has been a very difficult period to forecast as shelter-in-place orders and other COVID-19 related issues impact the bedding market,\u201d Chief Executive Scott Thompson said in a statement. \u201cBut there is no question that post-April order trends have been strong.\u201d The improvement has been broad-based across geographies, driving by improvements in the wholesale channel and robust growth in e-commerce, he said. Elsewhere, companies rushed to issue debt mostly in the form of bonds, continuing a trend seen for months as they seek to bolster liquidity during the downturn. Here are the latest things companies have said about COVID-19: \u2022 Abercrombie & Fitch Co. ANF, -3.02% is planning to offer up to $300 million of senior secured notes that mature in 2025.

The aluminum smelter has suffered \u201csignificant and recurring financial losses,\u201d which the company expects to continue. The alumina refinery at San Ciprian is not affected by the restructuring. \u2022 Chembio Diagnostic System Inc. shares CEMI, +1.00% tumbled after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) revoked an emergency use authorization for its antibody test. An antibody test doesn\u2019t test for a current COVID-19 infection; it instead assesses whether an individual has been exposed or been previously infected with the virus. The FDA has concerns about the accuracy of the test, which was one of the first serologic tests to receive emergency authorization during the COVID-19 pandemic, on April 14. The test reportedly generates \u201chigher than expected\u201d false results.\u201d The company previously said it plans to distribute the test in the U.S. and abroad, and it had announced a public offering in May to raise about $27.5 million, saying it would use proceeds in part to support the manufacturing and commercialization of the test.

Interim Chief Executive Aaron Cooper Groupon has \u201cdistinct competitive advantages\u201d to gain market share in its \u201chighly fragmented\u201d market. It ended the quarter with $667 million in cash, including $150 million in borrowings from its revolving credit facility.

MRK, -0.14% priced a $4.5 billion, four-part bond offering on Wednesday, joining the many companies issuing debt to bolster liquidity during the pandemic.

The Lexington, Ky.-based mattress company now expects second-quarter sales to fall 15%, as strong sales in May and early June offset a \u201cvery difficult\u201d April. \u201cThis has been a very difficult period to forecast as shelter-in-place orders and other COVID-19 related issues impact the bedding market,\u201d Chief Executive Scott Thompson said in a statement. \u201cBut there is no question that post-April order trends have been strong.\u201d The improvement has been broad-based across geographies, driving by improvements in the wholesale channel and robust growth in e-commerce, he said.
