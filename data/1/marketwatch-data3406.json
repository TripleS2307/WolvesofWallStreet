The House Democrats had offered a $3.4 trillion bill in May, while Senate Republicans, with the White House's blessing, put forward proposals scored independently at $1.1 trillion. Mnuchin said he and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows were willing to return if Democrats made new proposals."}]}
