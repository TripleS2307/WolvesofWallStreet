The letter indicates a lack of confidence in the White House medical team\u2019s own contact-tracing efforts regarding an ongoing virus outbreak that has infected President Donald Trump, multiple senior staff members and two U.S. senators, among others. News Pulse:White House is not tracing contacts of guests and staff at Rose Garden event 10 days ago: New York Times Coronavirus update:Expert calls for \u2018radical transparency\u2019 on Trump\u2019s coronavirus treatment and progress as more in president\u2019s circle test positive Co-signed by nine other local health departments from neighboring jurisdictions in Maryland and Virginia, the letter flatly states a belief that contact tracing on the outbreak has been insufficient. It says the public appeal is based on, \u201cour preliminary understanding that there has been limited contact tracing performed to date, there may be other staff and residents at risk for exposure to COVID positive individuals.\u201d It asks all White House employees, anyone who attended the Sept. 26 event and anyone who may have been in contact with those people to \u201ccontact your local health department for further guidance/questions regarding your potential need to quarantine.\u201d The letter represents a rising level of concern and a clear shift in strategy by Mayor Muriel Bowser\u2019s government, which had previously remained publicly hands-off and said it trusted the White House\u2019s robust medical operation to handle its own contact tracing and follow-up. Bowser said earlier this week that repeated attempts to contact the White House over the outbreak had received a \u201cvery cursory\u201d response but that she believed the necessary steps were being taken. \u201cThere are established public health protocols at the White House that are federal in nature,\u201d Bowser said on Monday. \u201cWe assume that those protocols have been engaged.\u201d A Health Department spokeswoman did not respond to questions on whether the letter had been directly sent to any White House employees or people who attended the Sept. 26 event, or if the D.C. government had been provided with a list of attendees. The move highlights the public health dilemma faced by Bowser\u2019s government regarding the current outbreak. The Trump White House has operated for months in open violation of several D.C. virus regulations, hosting multiple gatherings that exceeded the local 50-person limit and in which many participants didn\u2019t wear masks. It shines a further spotlight on the Sept. 26 Rose Garden ceremony to introduce Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Amy Coney Barrett. Multiple attendees, including Trump and University of Notre Dame President Rev. John Jenkins, who flew in from Indiana for the ceremony, have now tested positive. Washington\u2019s local virus regulations don\u2019t apply on federal property, but the current outbreak has blurred those distinctions. Trump inner-circle members like former counselor Kellyanne Conway, who has also tested positive, are D.C. residents, as are many of the staffers, employees, Secret Service members and journalists who have had close contact with infected officials. White House spokesman Judd Deere said Monday that the White House \u201chas established a robust contact tracing program led by the White House Medical Unit with CDC integration to provide appropriate recommendations.\u201d On Wednesday, White House deputy press secretary Brian Morgenstern detailed the in-house contact tracing regime to reporters. \u201cWe look back 48 hours to find people who may have been within six feet [of an infected person] for at least 15 minutes. And the purpose is to mitigate further transmission of the virus, correct? It\u2019s not to go back and identify patients zero. I understand that people are very curious about that I\u2019m curious too,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of an unknowable question as to where it entered the environment.\u201d The District of Columbia has reported 15,765 positive COVID-19 cases, with 634 deaths. Bowser on Wednesday announced she was extending the local state of emergency, which was scheduled to expire Oct. 9, through Dec. 31.
