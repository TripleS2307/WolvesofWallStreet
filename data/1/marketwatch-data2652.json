That was higher than the previous one-day record of roughly 229,000 counted last Friday, the data show. The U.S. recorded another 66,300 cases on Wednesday, just below the record of more than 67,000 cases reported on Tuesday. A full 43 states and territories have seen case numbers rise in the past 14 days, according to a New York Times tracker, showing Florida is the new hot spot in the U.S. Hospitals in parts of the South and West are straining to handle the case load. The cities of Houston, Miami and Phoenix are reporting dire shortages of intensive-care unit beds and staff. Public health experts and academics are astounded at the White House move to order hospitals to report COVID-19 data to the Department of Health and Human Services, instead of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the nation\u2019s premier public health agency. The decision is expected to make the data less transparent to the public and to researchers.

HHS and the White House broke a system that was working to put in a no-bid contract \u2014 contractor, inexperienced \u2014 to try to do something that is mission-critical to solve the pandemic,\u201d said Tom Frieden, a former head of the CDC and now a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cJust when you think can\u2019t get less organized or less functional, it does, in this country.\u201d iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } There was further outrage about Georgia\u2019s Gov. Brian Kemp ban on Georgia\u2019s cities and counties from ordering people to wear masks in public places. Kemp voided orders on Wednesday that at least 15 local governments across the state had adopted, as the Associated Press reported. Georgia has lost 3,091 people to the pandemic so far, the Johns Hopkins data show. The ban comes as other states are moving in the opposite direction, ordering residents to cover their faces, including Alabama on Wednesday. Public health experts agree that wearing a face mask, washing hands frequently and socially distancing are vital measures to contain the spread. Retailers Walmart Inc. WMT, +1.00% and Kroger Co. KR, +0.46% have both said face masks are mandatory for shoppers in their stores. The National Retail Federation is recommending that all retailers follow their example. Savannah Mayor Van Johnson was the first local official to defy Kemp and order masks, and had said police would start writing $500 citations to businesses that didn\u2019t enforce the law. Johnson called Kemp out by name on Twitter. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } The Harvard Global Health Institute (HGHI) shot down a suggestion by CDC Director Robert Redfield earlier this week that COVID-19 cases in the South were being caused by people from the North vacationing there after Memorial Day weekend. Redfield said there was a pop in cases around June 12 to June 16 caused by vacationers driving down south. \u201cThis is not what the data say,\u201d the HGHI said in a report. Infections in states including Nevada and Florida actually stared rising on June 1. \u201cRemember that there is always a lag between when infections occur and when they begin to be diagnosed,\u201d said the report. \u201cThis means that the increase in confirmed cases around June 1 comes from infections occurring around May 24, right around the Memorial Day weekend (and well before mid-June, as Dr. Redfield suggests.) So the data show that these outbreaks started before Northern vacationers supposedly traveled South.\u201d The more likely explanation is that infections are spiking because states reopened far too early. \u201cVirginia, on the other hand, remaine d in phase 1 of its reopening through the end of May and has fared significantly better than its neighbors,\u201d said the report. The HGHI\u2019s tracking tool is currently showing 11 states flashing red, led by Florida, which now has a seven-day average rate of 51.8 cases per 100,000 people. Harvard researchers say those states \u2014 the other 10 are Arizona, Louisiana, South Carolina, Alabama, Texas, Georgia, Nevada, Tennessee, Mississippi and Idaho \u2014need to reimpose stay-at-home orders. How Coronavirus Spread Across the U.S. Latest tallies The number of confirmed deaths from COVID-19 climbed to 584,990, while the number of people who have recovered climbed to 7.6 million. The U.S. leads the world with 3.49 million cases and 137,420 deaths. Brazil is second to the U.S. with 1.97 million cases and 75,366 deaths. India is third measured by cases at 968,876 followed by Russia with 751,612 and Peru with 337,751. The U.K. has 45,138 fatalities, the highest in Europe and third highest in the world. China, where the illness was first reported late last year, has 85,247 cases and 4,644 fatalities.

Johnson & Johnson CFO Joseph Wolk told CNBC that the company expects the Phase 1 trial for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate to begin next week. Wolk said the Phase 1 trial is expected to enroll more than 1,000 participants, primarily between the ages of 18 and 55 years old, although the company also plans to include a group of people who are 65 years old or older in the early-stage trial. He also said that J&J is in talks with the National Institutes of Health to move up the timeline for the anticipated Phase 3 trial to late September. \u201cThe science still has to play out,\u201d Wolk said. Dynavax Technologies Corp. DVAX, -3.68% announced that it will work with the Icahn School of Medicine at the Mount Sinai Hospital system in New York on a universal influenza vaccine. Mount Sinai has received funding from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to develop a vaccine and aims to use Dynavax\u2019s adjuvant technology to support that process. A universal flu vaccine would get rid of the need for annual flu vaccination, the organizations said in a news release.

The number of Americans applying for jobless benefits fell slightly in the second week of July to a post-pandemic low of 1.30 million, but the grudgingly small decline points to ongoing stress in the labor market as the economy struggles to cope with the latest coronavirus outbreak, MarketWatch\u2019s Jeffry Bartash and Greg Robb reported. New applications for unemployment compensation, a rough gauge of layoffs, fell 10,000 in the seven days ended July 11 to 1.30 million from a revised 1.31 million in the prior week, the Labor Department said Thursday. The figures are seasonally adjusted. Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast 1.24 million new claims. These figures reflect applications filed the traditional way through state unemployment offices. An unadjusted 928,488 people also applied for benefits through a temporary federal-relief program. Initial jobless benefit claims have stalled since mid-June when they hit 1.57 million. An economic rebound in May and June has lost momentum in July amid a fresh wave of coronavirus cases that has forced many states to either reimpose partial lockdowns or pause reopening plans. The latest setback is expected to put more people out of work again and delay the return of others to their jobs, making it harder for the economy to recover. Economists say Washington has to extend emergency unemployment benefits and increase other aid to prevent the situation from getting worse. \u201cThe trend in initial jobless claims has now just about stopped falling; next week could easily see an increase, for the first time since March, in the wake of the continued gradual reimposition of restrictions across the South and parts of the West,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. Separately, sales at U.S. retailers posted a big increase in June for the second month in a row, but that trend too may be sapped by the rise in new cases. Retail sales climbed 7.5% last month following a record 18.2% increase in May, the government said Thursday. Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast a 5.4% increase. \u201cRetail sales may have had a strong showing for June, but that\u2019s old news given how quickly the coronavirus resurgence is beating up the economy,\u201d said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union.What are companies saying? Morgan Stanley and Bank of America were the latest big banks to post earnings and they showed the same trend as other banks of strong trading and investment banking fees, offset by the need to set aside huge provisions for potential loan losses. Banks are warnings that they may be facing a wave of defaults as companies struggle in the pandemic. There was more upbeat news from Domino\u2019s Pizza, which has been thriving during lockdown periods and as consumer eat at home more. Johnson & Johnson beat profit and sales estimates for its latest quarter, amid strong demand for drugs. Cowen downgraded Walt Disney Co.\u2019s DIS, +1.53% stock on concerns that its parks and film business will be disrupted for longer than investors anticipate, and Citi reiterated a sell rating on Tesla Inc. TSLA, +1.89%, after its massive year-to-date rally, which has come even as its main plant in Fremont, California was shut down for much of the last quarter. \u201cWhat hasn\u2019t changed, in our view, is the lack of evidence to support the recent narrative in the stock-namely that Tesla is already experiencing seemingly \u2018unlimited\u2019 demand that\u2019s decoupled from autos, that traditional & emerging competitors stand little chance, that FSD/AV [fully self-driving technology] is industry leading and that Tesla should be valued vs. large Tech names,\u201d analyst Itay Michaeli wrote in a note to clients. \u201cIt is tough to fight the momentum, but it\u2019s even tougher to construct a fundamental risk/reward framework that makes sense here (particularly with COVID-19 risks), even if one is constructive on Tesla the company.\u201d Elsewhere, companies offered updated guidance and outlined ways they are managing liquidity in the pandemic, among other issues. MMM, +0.94% Here\u2019s the latest news about companies and COVID-19: \u2022 3M Co. MMM, +0.94% , the maker of Post-it Notes and industrial products, has filed 18 lawsuits and shut down thousands of deceptive websites and social media posts as it moves to prevent COVID-19 fraud and profiteering. The company is working with law enforcement agencies to help protect the public against those parties who are exploiting the strong demand for its products, which include N95 masks and other equipment. \u201cThe schemes we shut down were not only unlawful, they also endangered lives and wasted precious time and resources by diverting buyers from legitimate sources of much-needed respirators,\u201d Denise Rutherford, senior vice president of corporate affairs said in a statement. 3M has created hotlines and websites for consumers to report suspected fraud and has published pricing information for N95 masks to help them avoid inflated prices. The company has won 6 temporary restraining orders and 4 preliminary injunction orders from courts that halted unlawful actions, said the statement. \u2022 Abbott Laboratories ABT, +1.02% reported second-quarter profit and revenue that beat expectations and provided an upbeat full-year outlook. For 2020, the company expects adjusted EPS of \u201cat least\u201d $3.25, above the FactSet consensus of $2.90. \u201cWe\u2019re a leader in the global COVID-19 testing efforts, we\u2019ve continued to advance our pipeline and, importantly, we saw significant improvements in growth trends throughout the quarter in the business areas that were initially most impacted by the pandemic,\u201d said Chief Executive Robert Ford. \u2022 Alcoa Corp. AA, -1.65% reported a narrower second-quarter loss and sales were slightly ahead of expectations. The company made progress on its continuing asset review in preparation for potential sales and cost-cutting goals related to the pandemic. It increased its liquidity after completing the sale of $750 million worth of bonds on Monday, at a 5.5% coupon rate that was lower than any of its previous debt issuance. \u201cDespite challenging market conditions, our team has lowered production costs, increased output, maintained stable shipments, and improved our balance sheet,\u201d Chief Executive Roy Harvey said in a statement. \u201cWe continued to make progress in executing our strategic actions and 2020 programs, and we finished the quarter with a cash balance of nearly one billion dollars.\u201d \u2022 American Airlines Group Inc. AAL, +0.34% sent notices to 25,000 workers -- about one-fifth of its workforce -- about potential furloughs as the airline copes with what it calls slackening demand for air travel during the pandemic. American, which is prohibited from slashing jobs or pay rates through Sept. 30 under terms of $25 billion in federal payroll support, also urged employees to take buyout and early retirement packages before being forced to cut their jobs. The airline, which reported an 80% plunge in June revenue, says it will be overstaffed by 20,000 when federal aid expires Oct. 1. \u2022 Separately, American Airlines Group Inc. and JetBlue Airways Corp. JBLU, -0.07% announced a partnership aimed at creating more options for travelers in the Northeast U.S., to give the more choices across the airlines\u2019 domestic and international routes. The partnership includes an agreement that proposes code-share and loyalty benefits for flight offerings in New York and Boston. The partnership will allow American to launch service from New York\u2019s JFK airport to Tel Aviv and to Athens, and the JFK to Rio de Janeiro flight will return as a daily route in winter 2021, and will allow JetBlue to add flights in New York\u2019s LaGuardia Airport and New Jersey\u2019s Newark airport and grow its presence at JFK. \u2022 Bank of America Corp. BAC, +0.47% posted net income of $3.5 billion, or 37 cents a share, in the second quarter, down from $7.3 billion, or 74 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. The number was weighed down by a $4 billion build in loan loss provisions during the coronavirus pandemic. Revenue fell to $22.3 billion from $23.1 billion. The FactSet consensus was for EPS of 28 cents and revenue of $21.8 billion. \u201cStrong capital markets results provided an important counterbalance to the COVID-19-related impacts on our consumer business,\u201d Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said in a statement. Net interest income fell 11% to $10.8 billion, driven by lower interest rates. Noninterest income rose 5% to $11.5 billion, buoyed by strong capital markets results. Sales and trading revenue rose 28% to $4.2 billion, as FICC (fixed income, currencies and commodities) revenue climbed 50% to $4.2 billion and equities revenue rose 7% to $1.2 billion. Investment banking fees rose 57% to a record $2.2 billion, amid record capital raising by companies seeking to bolster liquidity during the pandemic. \u2022 Charles Schwab Corp. SCHW, +1.29% reported a second-quarter profit that topped expectations but revenue that fell why, as the pandemic created a \u201cmyriad challenges\u201d for its clients. Total client assets as of the end of June were $4.11 trillion, up 11% from a year ago. \u201cWe grappled with the ongoing health crisis, a contracting U.S. economy, and sustained pressures on interest rates, yet there were some encouraging signs as the quarter progressed, including domestic equity markets recovering to pre-pandemic levels,\u201d said Chief Executive Walt Bettinger. \u2022 Domino\u2019s Pizza Inc. DPZ, -2.50% reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that far exceeded expectations during the pandemic. U.S. same-store sales grew 16.1%, and international same-store sales rose 1.3%.

JCPNQ, -3.42% announced a company restructuring that includes 152 store closures and a head count reduction of 1,000 workers across corporate roles, management and internationally. J.C. Penney filed for bankruptcy protection in May after which Cowen analysts forecast the company would have to shutter 25% of its locations. J.C. Penney has 90,000 employees, according to FactSet and, as of February 2020, had 850 locations in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. \u2022 J.Jill Inc. JILL, +6.45% reached an agreement with lenders to extend a forbearance period to July 23 to give the company more time to complete negotiations. \u201cWe are making progress with the negotiations and expect a resolution soon,\u201d Interim Chief Executive Jim Scully said in a statement. The Quincy, Mass.-based women\u2019s clothing retailer entered the forbearance agreements in June after falling out of compliance with certain covenants on its asset-based lending facility and term loans during pandemic. \u201cThe uncertainty created by recent events generate scenarios that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued,\u201d the company said in its 10k filing published in June. \u2022 Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +1.39% reported second-quarter profit and sales that beat expectations, and raised its full-year outlook. Consumer health sales fell 7.0% to miss expectations, while pharmaceutical sales grew 2.1% to slightly top expectations and medical device sales dropped 33.9% but was above expectations. \u201cOur second quarter results reflect the impact of COVID-19 and the enduring strength of our pharmaceutical business, where we saw continued growth even in this environment,\u201d said Chief Executive Alex Gorsky.

NCLH, +2.91% is offering $250 million of stock in a syndicated deal. J.P. Morgan, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Barclays, Mizuho Securities and UBS are joint book-runners on the deal.
