Now we know their plan of action to avoid this outcome. On Wednesday, the Fed rolled out of the final details of its new strategy, promising to allow inflation to overshoot its 2% target and setting a relatively strict criteria for the next interest-rate hike. One goal is to avoid past mistakes of tightening too soon to strangle a recovery, said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank, both in the quicksand of zero rates, provide cautionary tales for the Fed. Low inflation can cause inflation expectations to drift down, pulling inflation lower. This pulls interest rates toward zero, giving central banks less room to support the economy in a future downturn. \u201cWe have seen this dynamic play out in other economies around the world, and we are determined to avoid it here in the United States,\u201d Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said earlier this year. \u201c \u201cWe have seen this dynamic play out in other economies around the world, and we are determined to avoid it here in the United States.\u201d \u201d \u2014 Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, on Jan. 29 A host of factors \u2014 mainly an aging population \u2014 have created a glut of savings that has pushed down global interest rates. These forces have hit Japan and Europe hard and their central banks are struggling to find ways to stimulate tepid economies. \u201cThis is why the Fed feels it has to try to avoid slipping into those situations,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays. Ethan Harris,head of global research at Bank of America, agreed: \u201cThe Fed is taking these actions to avoid getting trapped in a permanent low-inflation world, so-called \u2018Japanification.\u2019\u201d Although not in dire shape, the central banks in these two major economies have been unable to spur demand. \u201cIt is like the economy is never really out of the hospital, in a sense,\u201d Harris said. Recap:Live blog of Fed\u2019s decision day on Wednesday Prominent economists first suggested the Fed should raise its inflation target to a 3% or 4% annual rate to avoid the quicksand. But the Fed rejected this prescription, likely fearing a backlash from Congress. Instead, under the strategy revealed fully this week, the Fed has now pledged to hold rates between zero and 0.25% until the economy has reached maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2% and is on track to \u201cmoderately exceed 2% for some time.\u201d Harris said the details of the strategy were kept vague and flexible so Powell could garner support from the members of the FOMC. Even so, there were two dissents. In the old days, this type of discretion for a central bank would have been viewed as highly inflationary, Posen said. \u201cThere are a dozen different indicators of unemployment and a dozen for inflation,\u201d Posen said. The Fed also projects it won\u2019t need to raise rates at least through the end of 2023. Roberto Perli, a former Fed staffer and now an analyst with Cornerstone Maco, thinks the Fed will be on hold until 2025.

The COVID-19 pandemic will make the Fed\u2019s goal of achieving higher inflation harder as wages are not expected to rise. \u201cThey will be quite lucky to hit the inflation target, let alone overshoot it in the next three years,\u201d Harris said. The Fed had more credibility a decade ago to hit the 2% inflation target, Harris said. \u201cNow the whole world is in a prove-it-to-me mode,\u201d he added. The fact that there was no major move in financial markets DJIA, +0.56% SPX, +0.87% on Thursday as a result of the Fed\u2019s new strategy is a bit of a disappointment for Powell, Posen said. In theory, if the Fed commits to not raise interest rates early next time, there should be a jump in inflation expectations. But that didn\u2019t happen. \u201cThey are discovering, like the Bank of Japan and the ECB before it, that if the economy is going against you and you\u2019ve undershot your inflation targets for years, even well-intentioned talk isn\u2019t going to matter,\u201d Posen added. \u201cThe U.S. feels like Europe felt like in the last cycle, when it couldn\u2019t get inflation anywhere close to target, and their economy stumbled,\u201d Harris said. While the Fed and Congress have poured trillions of dollars into the economy, it is still only operating at about \u201c60%\u201d of capacity and is vulnerable to policy mistakes, like the failure of another stimulus package from Congress, he said. \u201cThe current is running faster. The Fed is swimming a little faster but has lost some ground,\u201d Harris said. \u201cIt is an open question on whether or not this works,\u201d Gapen agreed. \u201cI think the Fed is trying to say \u2018we definitely want to try to avoid getting into a situation where we feel more permanently impotent.\u2019\u201d \u201cWe are fortunate that the U.S. economy appears to recover in a way to generate enough inflation where we don\u2019t look like Europe and Japan yet, but there\u2019s no guarantee that we\u2019re just not a couple of cycles away from them,\u201d he said."}]}
