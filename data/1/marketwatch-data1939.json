The rules require a certain percentage of work truck sales each year to be zero emission vehicles. By the time its fully implemented in 2035, the board estimates at least 20% of the 1.2 million trucks on the road would run on electricity and that it would create thousands of new jobs. Over 100 people called into the California Air Resources Board\u2019s meeting Thursday, mostly offering their support during hours-long public comment. Dozens said their neighborhoods were choking on air pollution from diesel fuel, particularly threatening the lung health of poor and minority communities, which has gained more prominence amid the coronavirus pandemic. Supporters included a group representing environmental agencies from eight states in the Northeast, from New York to Maine, whose officials said it would create a road map for reducing emissions on trucking routes and propel the market toward electrification. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way we think we can make significant progress on the most stubborn air pollution problems,\u201d said Mary Nichols, chair of the board. \u201cThis will have a really transformational impact not just in our state but around the world when people see that it can be done.\u201d Regulators said they were determined to quickly address fears electric trucks would go unsold, aiming to establish rules next year that would require companies to purchase zero emission trucks from manufacturers, meant to ensure there is demand for the supply. The Truck and Engine Manufacturers Association argued the new rule would eventually \u201ccollapse\u201d because there are not enough charging stations. \u201cThey cost more than traditional fuel trucks, because there\u2019s no charging infrastructure and developing one is very expensive,\u201d Jed Mandel, president of the association, said during public testimony. \u201cAnd there is inadequate incentive funding available.\u201d Meanwhile, a representative for Tesla TSLA, +1.89% , which is preparing electric pickup truck and semitruck models for production in 2021, endorsed the measure. \u201cCharging infrastructure can and will be built,\u201d said Andy Schwartz, a policy advisor at Tesla. Work trucks and delivery vans, while just a small fraction of all vehicles on the road, are some of the largest sources of air pollution in the transportation sector. They travel many more miles than passenger vehicles and often have diesel engines, which are more powerful but produce more pollution than gasoline engines. California has lots of these trucks on the road because it is home to two of the largest ports in the world at Los Angeles and Long Beach, where heavy duty trucks are constantly hauling freight to and from warehouses in the Inland Empire while spewing harmful pollutants into the air. The American Lung Association\u2019s State of the Air report for 2020 said seven of the 10 most ozone-polluted cities in the U.S. are in California, with 98% of its residents living in counties with poor air quality. The rules, which would not take effect until 2024, will require at least 40% of all tractor trailers sold in California to be zero emission by 2035. For smaller trucks, including models like the Ford F, -1.36% F-250, 55% of all sales would be zero emission by 2035. The standard is the toughest for delivery trucks and vans, with 75% of sales required to be zero emission by 2035. California already has similar rules in place for passenger vehicle sales. But no one has yet imposed rules like these for work trucks, which unlike passenger vehicles are purchased with the intent of returning a profit. Critics argue requiring the industry to sell more electric trucks won\u2019t succeed without first requiring companies to buy more of them. Staff for the board said work on such rules is ongoing and added that demand already exists for bulk orders of electric trucks. Nichols said the board plans to adopt rules next year requiring fleets to have a certain percentage of electric trucks. \u201cFirst you have to make sure the engines and the trucks are going to be available, then you have to ensure there is a market for them,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re proceeding methodically to make that happen.\u201d"}]}
