Work, kids, weekend activities, family road trips \u2014 you need one vehicle that does it all, makes your life easier, and provides maximum safety and security for the people you love the most. Our advice? Get a minivan. Minivans aren\u2019t necessarily boring to drive, as you\u2019ll find with a Honda HMC, -1.21% Odyssey. They can be exceptionally efficient, too, especially the Chrysler Pacifica with its available plug-in hybrid powertrain. On a tight budget? The Chrysler Voyager is the minivan to get. The Kia Sedona boasts exceptional warranty coverage and SUV styling cues, while foul-weather dwellers may prefer the Toyota TM, -0.65% Sienna for its optional all-wheel-drive system. Regardless of your choice, they all supply seating for at least seven people and include sliding side doors that make it easy to load children. They have deep wells behind the third-row seats that won\u2019t disgorge groceries or sporting equipment when you open the rear liftgate. They provide acceptable to exceptional protection based on crash-test ratings. To top it off, minivans are more affordable and efficient than a typical SUV, too. Which one should you get? As ranked by our official expert ratings, these are the best minivans you can buy in 2020.Best minivans of 2020 1. 2020 Honda Odyssey 2. 2020 Chrysler Pacifica 3. 2020 Chrysler Voyager 4. 2020 Toyota Sienna 5. 2020 Kia Sedona1. 2020 Honda Odyssey KBB.com rating: 4.6 out of 5 The Honda Odyssey is the best minivan for the most people. It\u2019s KBB\u2019s highest-rated minivan of 2020, the year\u2019s Minivan Best Buy and the category\u2019s Resale Value Award champion. No surprise that it\u2019s also the bestselling minivan in the country and arguably the best family car ever made. We should know. We lived with one for a year. One of just two minivans to earn a Top Safety Pick rating from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), the Honda Odyssey is priced from about $32,000 for LX trim, including the destination charge. You\u2019ll want the Odyssey EX (about $36,000) at a minimum, though, for its full suite of advanced driving assistance systems. Leather is available starting with EX-L trim, the Touring gets a built-in vacuum cleaner, and the Elite is loaded with luxuries.2. 2020 Chrysler Pacifica KBB.com rating: 4.5 out of 5 The other minivan on this list to earn a Top Safety Pick rating from the IIHS is the stylish Chrysler Pacifica. Aside from its demonstrated ability to protect your family in a collision, the Pacifica\u2019s unique Stow \u2018N Go second-row seats are perfect for people who regularly make use of a minivan\u2019s maximum cargo carrying capabilities. See: New car review: The Hyundai Venue Better yet, the Pacifica Hybrid is a plug-in hybrid supplying 32 miles of electric range before traveling a total of 488 additional miles on the gasoline engine. It starts at about $41,500 before factoring in the $7,500 federal income tax credit and any state or local incentives. Otherwise, your choices include Touring, Touring L, Touring L Plus, Limited, and Red S, all equipped with a powerful V6 engine. They range in price from about $35,250 to $50,000.3. 2020 Chrysler Voyager KBB.com rating: 4.5 out of 5 For 2020, Chrysler FCAU, -0.95% dusts off the classic Voyager nameplate and attaches it to a high-value version of the Pacifica. The two vans are essentially the same vehicle, the Voyager offering less equipment and a lower price. As a result, the Voyager is KBB\u2019s new 5-Year Cost To Own champion. They all have a robust 3.6-liter V6 engine, but the Chrysler Voyager does without Stow \u2018N Go second-row seats and doesn\u2019t offer a plug-in hybrid option. The IIHS hasn\u2019t rated it, either, but because it is structurally identical to the Pacifica, and the two vans wear the same sheet metal, protection levels should be the same. Two trims are available: L and LX. Prices start at about $28,500. 4. 2020 Toyota Sienna KBB.com rating: 4.4 out of 5 It\u2019s been a decade since Toyota last redesigned the Sienna, and the minivan\u2019s age shows in its middling frontal-impact crash-test ratings from the IIHS. But when you want all-wheel drive in a minivan, combined with seating for up to eight people and as much as 150 cu-ft of cargo space, well, this is your only choice.

Plus, it\u2019s available with what Toyota calls an Auto Access Seat option, making it easier for physically impaired passengers to get into and out of the van. A variety of Toyota Sienna trim levels cater to budget-minded buyers (Sienna L from about $32,750), driving enthusiasts (Sienna SE from about $39,000), and luxury seekers (Sienna Limited Platinum from about $49,250).5. Kia Sedona KBB.com rating: 4.3 out of 5 What\u2019s that? You didn\u2019t know Kia made a minivan? It does, and the 2020 Sedona is a stylish choice that, if not for the exposed sliding door tracks beneath the rear windows, might be mistaken for a crossover SUV. Also see: These are the best cars for families in 2020 Offering decent IIHS crash-test ratings combined with industry-leading warranty and roadside assistance coverage that puts the other minivans on this list to shame, the Kia Sedona starts at about $28,750 in L trim. It, and the LX (about $31,500), have stain-resistant cloth upholstery, which anyone with little kids will appreciate. The EX (from about $35,000) and SX (from about $42,750) include leather, and all Sedonas have Slide-n-Stow second-row seats that collapse like folding chairs to maximize cargo capacity.
