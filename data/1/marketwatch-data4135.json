The September silver contract US:SIU20 rose 73 cents, or 3.9%, to settle at $19.788 an ounce Monday. That was the highest finish for a most-active contract since September 2016, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Gold on Monday, meanwhile, saw its August contract US:GCQ20 settle at $1,814.10 an ounce, close to the $1,820.60 it settled at on July 8, which was the highest since September 2011. There has been a historically high purchase of physical silver via silver exchange-traded funds in the past few months alone, said Peter Spina, president and chief executive officer at GoldSeek.com. \u201cNever in the history of silver have we seen such demand for [the metal] in such a short period of time.\u201d As of June 30, global holdings of silver in silver exchange-traded products, or ETPs, which include ETFs, reached a \u201cfresh all-time high of 925 million ounces, which is roughly 14 months of mine supply,\u201d according to a recent report from The Silver Institute, an international industry association. ETP growth in the first half of 2020 of 196 million ounces \u201ccomfortably surpassed\u201d the highest annual inflow of 149 million ounces set in 2009, the report said. Among the reasons for the surge in silver interest, Spina pointed out that the metal has been \u201cdismissed and mostly ignored over the last few years, as many former silver buyers turned to cryptocurrency and more exciting markets.\u201d The value of silver, however, is \u201cdifficult to ignore,\u201d Spina, who is also president of silver news and analysis provider SilverSeek.com, told MarketWatch. \u201cOne of the best value indicators is the relative value of silver to gold,\u201d he said, pointing out that during extremes in the market selloffs, the ratio of gold to silver could spike to around 130 \u2014 meaning that it would take 130 ounces of silver to buy one ounce of gold. That ratio is now back under 100, but that figure should be closer to 50 instead, he said. \u201cEven at a 50 ratio, silver is far removed from the ratio found naturally,\u201d said Spina, as silver is found at a ratio of nearly 20 ounces per ounce of gold. BullionVault\u2019s Ash said that even if the ratio manages to retreat to 84, the bottom of its four-year uptrend, by the end of August from the current four-month low of 93, that would put silver at $21.50, if gold holds the $1,800 level. A move up to gold\u2019s all-time, roughly $1,900 peak could put silver at $22.60, he said. The settlement record for most-active gold futures stands at $1,891.90 from Aug. 22, 2011, based on records going back to November 1984, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The record intraday level was seen at $1,923.70 an ounce on Sept. 6, 2011. Ash pointed out to MarketWatch that silver has jumped from its COVID-19 price crash to an 11-year low in mid-March by 58% in just 80 trading days. That puts the March to July 2020 performance in the \u201ctop 4% of all four-month gains over the last half-century,\u201d he told MarketWatch. Even so, silver has outpaced this current surge many times \u2014 in 1974, 1979, 1982, 1987, 2010 and 2011, which all marked times of extreme economic or financial stress, so \u201cwhen silver gets moving, it can really move,\u201d he said. \u201cThe number of private individuals seeing stability and diversification with precious metals has never been greater,\u201d with silver holdings on BullionVault up by 26% so far this year, versus 11% growth in gold, Ash said. \u201c $100-an-ounce silver is \u2018not at all unreasonable in the coming several years\u2026\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Peter Spina, GoldSeek.com With gold now heading toward $2,000 and beyond, silver is poised to march higher too, said Spina. He said his first target for silver prices is $25 to $30 in the coming few quarters, but the \u201cliftoff\u201d for silver is \u201cnow well under way.\u201d In the coming years, with gold moving above $2,000, Spina sees silver \u201crevisiting its non-inflation adjusted highs of $50\u201d and potentially higher, with $100-an-ounce silver \u201cnot at all unreasonable in the coming several years, and it may be shocking to many how quickly it can move.\u201d"}]}
