Inspired by blowout earnings from tech heavyweights Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google parent Alphabet, stocks rallied at the open, slipped into mostly negative territory during the session, and then recovered in the final hour.What did the major benchmarks do? The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% added 114.67 points, or 0.4%, to close at 26,428.32, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% gained 24.90 points, or 0.8%, ending the trading day at 3,271.12. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39% closed at 10,745.27, up 157.46 points or 1.5%. The Dow on Thursday fell 225.92 points, or 0.9%, to end at 26,313.65, while the S&P 500 lost 12.22 points, or 0.4%, to close at 3,246.22.

Tech earnings were in focus following results from some of the industry\u2019s largest and most powerful players after Thursday\u2019s closing bell, including Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.74%, Facebook Inc. FB, +0.26%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +3.01% and Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, +1.82% GOOG, +1.97%. Apple soared 10% to a new record high, while Facebook gained 7%. Read:Pandemic? Antitrust? No worries for Big Tech, which racked up $200 billion in sales anyway Need to Know:Apple and Amazon to dominate an economy \u2018without mouths or noses\u2019 but 10% of jobs may never come back, strategist says But it was a different story outside the tech sector with the energy sector hit by poor second quarter results and Dow component Chevron CVX, -1.62% down 2.7%. \u201cThis morning the mood was mixed with a plethora of earnings results. Exxon had its worst quarterly loss in modern history, while Chevron\u2019s results were the worst in three decades,\u201d said Edward Moya, analyst at Oanda, in a note. Stocks softened after a downbeat reading on U.S. consumer sentiment. The final reading of the University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment index in July slipped to 72.5 from an initial 72.9. The index registered 73.2 in June. \u201cThe deterioration in consumer sentiment along with a failure to extend full emergency unemployment benefits will weigh on consumer spending,\u201d said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at Oxford Economics. \u201cWe do expect policy makers to approve another round of direct payments to households, but that will provide only temporary relief.\u201d There was little sign of progress in talks between congressional Democrats, Republicans and the White House on a new coronavirus relief bill with expanded unemployment benefits due to expire Friday. Democrats rejected a White House proposal to temporarily extend the $600-a-week in added benefits, saying the Trump administration didn\u2019t understand the severity of the crisis. Talks between Trump administration officials and congressional Democrats could stretch into the weekend, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told reporters Friday morning. Peter Andersen, founder of Boston-based Andersen Capital Management, thinks investors should take some comfort from the unprecedented messaging coming from policy makers, both monetary and fiscal. While the details of another aid package aren\u2019t finalized yet, Andersen said in an interview, Washington is sending \u201csignals\u201d that it will support the economy. \u201cIn a moment when we can\u2019t be analytical, it\u2019s important to be psychological,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled that the Fed came out and said, we\u2019re going to keep rates low. I just think the market is positioned for a tremendous rally when the consumer emerges from lockdown with a vaccine, low gas prices and ultra-low interest rates.\u201d Still, the drumbeat of bad news continues, for now. The U.S. saw record deaths from COVID-19 in Texas, Florida and Arizona, while California faced its second-deadliest day. In vaccine news, European drugmaker Sanofi SNY, +0.89% said the U.S. government will pay up to $2.1 billion for the COVID-19 vaccine candidate it is developing with GlaxoSmithKline GSK, +1.10%. The funding, part of Operation Warp Speed, will be used to support ongoing clinical development and manufacturing of the experimental candidate, with at least 100 million doses promised to the U.S. U.S. consumer spending rose 5.6% in June, while personal incomes declined by 1.1%, government data showed, but spending may be slowing again in July given unemployment benefit claims are edging up again in weekly data. A related measure of core inflation, the Federal Reserve\u2019s favorite gauge of price pressures, rose 0.2%, in line with expectations. The employment cost index for the second quarter rose 0.5%, versus expectations for a 0.6% rise.Which companies were in focus?
