The Nasdaq Composite was up about 0.2% and briefly turned negative but had been up by as many as 159 points or 1.5%, propelled by gains in Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.74%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +3.01% and Facebook Inc. FB, +0.26% among others following stronger-than-expected results late Thursday. Gains for the broader market appeared to soften after modest opening gains, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% down 0.6% and the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% off 0.3%, weighed by declines in energy XLE, -1.59% and financials XLF, +0.11%, considered more economically sensitive sectors of the market."}]}
