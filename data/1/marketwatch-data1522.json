U.S. prices, however, ended with a modest gain for the week. \"This week, fundamentals generally came in supportive, headlined by a strong draw for U.S. crude and gasoline stocks\" in Wednesday's Energy Information Administration report. \"Still, gasoline demand provided a bit of a warning signal with a week-on-week decline, which is coupled with expected upticks in unemployment filings ahead as [Thursday] saw the U.S. log a record number of new COVID-19 cases,\" said Robbie Fraser, senior commodity analyst at Schneider Electric, in a note. August West Texas Intermediate oil clq20 fell 16 cents, or 4%, to settle at $40.59 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. For the week, the front-month contract climbed by roughly 0.1%, according to FactSet data."}]}
