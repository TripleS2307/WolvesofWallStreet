I didn\u2019t hug my mom Betty for 200 days because her nursing home in Jacksonville, Fla., was on lockdown. Before that, my brothers and I saw her virtually every single day. She suffered a debilitating stroke and was left with aphasia (a brain disorder), so she is unable to communicate and has cognitive deficits. While technology has been the solution for many, talking to her through a video screen isn\u2019t an option for us. Not long after the lockdown, my mother\u2019s facility opened up window visits. But sitting on the sidewalk on a noisy street and seeing her through a grainy window screen is more frustrating than it\u2019s worth. My mom either closes her eyes or cries. She doesn\u2019t understand. She misses my morning visits when I\u2019d show up with coffee and doughnuts. And there\u2019s no way to explain this to her. Our pleading and begging with the facility\u2019s administrators have fallen on deaf ears. They\u2019re just following government mandates and, I believe, they genuinely want to protect their residents from this deadly virus. On Sept. 17, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released new guidance easing some nursing home visitation restrictions, but facilities may interpret the guidelines differently. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen the stories in the news and heard the outcry from families who fear that their loved ones in these locked-down facilities are declining. Family engagement, love, human touch and hugs are all important to everyone, but especially to those who may be suffering from physical and mental decline.Caregivers for Compromise The first few months of lockdown, I was just going about my business, griping to anyone who would listen about how cruel this process was. Residents of these facilities felt imprisoned. Punished. Cut off. And like my mom, they felt unloved. Some quit eating due to depression. Some died. It felt like my brothers and I were fighting an uphill battle. Don\u2019t miss: The case for defunding nursing homes and replacing them with a radically different model That\u2019s when I stumbled upon a Facebook FB, +0.26% group called \u201cCaregivers for Compromise \u2013 because isolation kills too!\u201d It was started by a woman in Jacksonville who got a job as a dishwasher at her husband\u2019s memory care facility, just so she could see him. And thus began a groundswell of concerned, disgruntled and downright angry family members who were being kept from their loved ones. What began as a group to connect with others and share stories and commiserate, became state-by-state grass roots action chapters rallying legislators and politicians to find ways to let families reconnect with their loved ones in assisted living facilities, nursing homes and group homes. It\u2019s a place of angry and frustrated voices, but also an idea bank where real solutions are being developed and shared. It\u2019s social media at its best. In Florida, a group of volunteers put together a white paper for the governor and made heart-wrenching videos to garner media attention. Other states followed suit. Word spread through the Facebook groups that Minnesota had successfully lobbied for the Essential Family Caregiver Program which granted family members who had previously provided essential caregiving services to their loved ones access to the facilities. This became the rallying cry and buzzword for other states. Reporters joined these groups so they could feature families in their nightly newscasts. As family members, our voices were finally being heard. But our ultimate goal was to lift the lockdowns and allow us to see our loved ones.PPE, testing and social distancing As a family member and an advocate, it\u2019s a tough situation. I want to spend time with my mom but that also means allowing other people into my mom\u2019s facility, which increases the risk of spreading COVID-19. Also see: Are we undercounting or overcounting COVID-19 deaths? I\u2019m a masker and a distancer, but how could I know if other residents\u2019 visitors were equally as vigilant? I certainly didn\u2019t want my mom exposed to the virus. I know from speaking to other families that we would all go to great lengths to be able to see our loved ones even for periodic visits. We\u2019d get tested regularly, wear all forms of PPE, quarantine if necessary and even socially distance, which is tough because I really want to hug my mom. She doesn\u2019t speak, so human touch is our only form of communication. I generally hug my mom 365 days a year. I\u2019ve only hugged her twice in the last six months. The 51 chapters of Caregivers for Compromise continued to feed off one another. There were letter-writing campaigns to legislators. Sit-ins in parking lots of facilities. Media interviews. Tweet campaigns. Anything that could tear at the heartstrings of those in charge. Even within states, there is little standardization about visitors. Some facilities have usurped the government orders and created their own protocols, while others have gone to the extreme of barring any contact at all, even window visits. But these family members are all about accountability. They\u2019ve shared form letters and emails holding corporate owners and facility administrators responsible for failures in the daily care of their loved ones. It\u2019s the true definition of grass roots. And those grass roots efforts have led to media coverage, which then prompted some states to revise their visitation policies. The key message on behalf of all families is pretty much the same: there are safe ways to allow us access to our loved ones: PPE, distancing and testing. We want to keep residents and ourselves safe, too. Slowly, states are lifting the mandates on lockdown, but many facilities are still left grappling with the logistics of how to reopen to visitors safely. And I get that. In August, Florida\u2019s governor opened up access, but most facilities are still closed to visitors as corporate owners and internal staff reckon with \u201csafe access.\u201d Families have learned that there is strength in numbers. And that we really are all in this together. Keeping each other motivated and informed is the key to successfully fighting the system. See: This is one task everyone in their 50s should consider before it\u2019s too late These days, my visits with my mother are very limited; I\u2019m allowed two one-hour visits a week. I don\u2019t like this new normal and hope we can return to our daily visits. It\u2019s been a long, hard fight, but one in which I was never alone.
