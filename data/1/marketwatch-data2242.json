Stephanie Keith/Getty Images Americans who lacked the ability to work from home during the first four months of the pandemic both sustained steeper job losses and showed more symptoms of respiratory illness than their remote-working counterparts, according to a new working paper \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with some of the worst effects falling on non-remote workers from the poorest families. As COVID-19\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spread across the U.S. prompted stay-at-home orders and business closures, the share of non-remote workers who lost their employment by early April was three times higher (24%) than the share of remote workers who lost their jobs (8%), estimated the study, conducted by researchers from the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Southern California and distributed by the National Bureau of Economic Research. The easing of restrictions on non-essential businesses didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t significantly boost employment, the report\u00e2\u0080\u0099s authors added. And though job losses were also worse for women than for men, for people without a college degree than for those with a college degree, and for African-American people and Hispanic people than for white people, the gap between non-remote and remote workers was wider. Meanwhile, non-remote workers experienced worse respiratory health than those who worked remotely, the study found, as demonstrated by their tendency to report more symptoms of respiratory illness and perceive greater risk of being infected with the coronavirus. \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098Since the losses were highest among remote workers from very low income households, these disparities exacerbated growing income inequality in the U.S.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 researchers from the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Southern California Measuring symptoms such as cough, fever, shortness of breath, sore throat or sneezing provided a \u00e2\u0080\u009cproxy for exposure to respiratory pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the report said, referring to the virus that causes COVID-19. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause COVID-19 is less prevalent than other respiratory illnesses (e.g. the common cold), most reported symptoms do not arise from actual COVID-19 cases,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it added. The pandemic compounded disparities that had already existed, the authors wrote: Non-remote workers from low-income households bore the brunt of job losses \u00e2\u0080\u009cand, to a lesser extent, health losses.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur results highlight the double burden borne by non-remote workers: these workers had substantially larger job losses, and those who kept their jobs faced elevated health risks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the researchers wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSince the losses were highest among remote workers from very low income households, these disparities exacerbated growing income inequality in the U.S.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The study authors conducted a longitudinal survey as part of the University of Southern California\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ongoing Understanding America Study, analyzing data from a nationally representative panel of 6,922 U.S. adults. They surveyed respondents every other week between March and July.\u00c2 The researchers also examined differences in protective behaviors taken by people in work and non-work-related contexts. While remote and non-remote workers didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t significantly differ in their protective behaviors outside of work, \u00e2\u0080\u009cpeople with non-remote jobs in March practiced fewer work-related protective behaviors, especially if they remained employed in April-July,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn this case, the double difference is 11 percentage points,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the authors said, \u00e2\u0080\u009csuggesting that the worse health outcomes for non-remote workers may relate to the nature of their jobs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Policymakers should work to reduce non-remote workers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 risk of infection to address the problems they face during the pandemic, the authors suggested. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNevertheless, it appears unlikely that non-remote workers will face dramatic improvements in their employment opportunities in the short run,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAdequate financial assistance for the unemployed, therefore, appears to be an essential policy tool.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}]}
