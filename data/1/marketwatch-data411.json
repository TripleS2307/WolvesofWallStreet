Wednesday posted a smaller profit in the latest quarter compared with last year as sales to restaurants remained challenged by reduced demand during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Eagle, Idaho-based potato-products company said its first-quarter profit fell to $89.3 million, or 61 cents a share, from $115.7 million, or 79 cents a share, in the same three-month period a year earlier. Analysts polled by FactSet had forecast a profit of 31 cents a share. Revenue was $871.5 million, a drop from $989 million in last year's first quarter. Analysts were expecting revenue of $869 million. Demand remained below pre-pandemic levels but stabilized as the quarter progressed, Chief Executive Tom Werner said, citing sequentially increasing sales to quick-service and full-service restaurants as business improved for those sectors. Retail demand remained strong but declined below the peak it had reached earlier in the public-health crisis, Mr. Werner said. Volume declined 14% year over year, with higher-than-usual retail sales only partially offsetting lower sales volumes to restaurants. Write to Matt Grossman at matt.grossman@wsj.com"}]}
