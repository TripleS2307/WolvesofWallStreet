Ask these 6 questions to find the place that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right for you", "body": "You may have been impressed by a city you visited once on vacation or that you discovered while scrolling through a list of affordable places to live. But if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re considering a move and looking for a new city to call home, a lot of factors influence your decision. Here are a half dozen questions to answer before landing on your next place to live, and where to gather the information so\u00c2 you can find a city that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just right for you.1. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the cost of living?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Knowing just how far your hard-earned dollar will go in a new city is a priority when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking to relocate.\u00c2 As more companies\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2 particularly those in tech, finance and insurance \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2 allow their employees to continue working remotely on a full-time basis after COVID-19, more people have the option to\u00c2 move out of big, expensive metro areas\u00c2 and find more affordable places to live. The appeal of affordable small and midsize cities has never been stronger or more attainable;\u00c2 imagine working for a Bay Area tech company, but living in a smaller, friendlier city and paying a fraction of Bay Area rent (seriously, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t read\u00c2 these median home\u00c2 prices\u00c2 unless you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sitting down). This trend also allows employers to hire top talent without hefty relocation and cost of living fees. This could bolster the appeal of places like\u00c2 Tulsa, which has been setting up incentive programs to\u00c2 convince remote workers to move to their cities\u00c2 through the\u00c2 Tulsa Remote program. Of course, housing affordability is a good metric to begin with, and you can plug U.S. cities into Livability\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cFind Your City\u00e2\u0080\u009d tool\u00c2 to easily access data on median home prices, median rent, and a housing affordability ranking. But cost of living isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just about housing costs. Other considerations include things like retail sales tax rates, parks passes, fishing licenses, parking fees, the price of an average lunch out, and how much it costs\u00c2 to register and insure your car, says\u00c2 Baron Christopher Hanson, lead consultant and owner of\u00c2 RedBaronUSA, who has worked as a consultant with\u00c2 chamber of commerce groups.

Homeowner\u00c2 association fees have been on the rise throughout the country, according to a\u00c2 study from Trulia. Average monthly HOA fees were $250 in 2005 but ballooned to $331 by 2015, which outpaced the growth in housing prices and inflation rates. Metros with the cheapest monthly HOA fees included Nashville, Tennessee ($194); Las Vegas, Nevada ($198); Indianapolis, Indiana ($213); Charlotte, North Carolina ($218) and Warren, Michigan ($218).\u00c2 HOA fees can be tricky. They might seem outrageous to former renters or those who lived in a neighborhood that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have associations, explains Tracy Jones, a Realtor with Re/Max RMAX, -0.35% \u00c2 Oak Crest Realty in Elkhart, Indiana and Sarasota, Florida. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut these fees might include trash, cable, security, a gym, internet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo, you might actually save money.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The takeaway?

Economic development offices make information available about key industries and will often have data on the area\u00e2\u0080\u0099s major employers and how many people each company employs.
