His actions to defer payroll taxes and replace the expired supplemental $600 unemployment benefit with a plan that would pay up to $400, in particular, drew questions about their effectiveness, and whether the president has the right to overwrite the legislative branch of U.S. government. Nobel Prize-winning economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman is among the most vocal critics, calling payroll tax cuts \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe hydroxychloroquine of economic policy\u00e2\u0080\u009d in both a CNN interview and on his official Twitter TWTR, -0.23% \u00c2 account on Sunday. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } His dig harks back to the fervid belief by some during the pandemic, including the president, that the malaria drug would be a silver bullet against COVID-19. That has not proven to be the case. Krugman said that payroll tax cuts are a \u00e2\u0080\u009cknown bad idea\u00e2\u0080\u009d on CNN, adding, \u00e2\u0080\u009cEven Senate Republicans basically said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s forget about that. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a really stupid idea,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d during deliberations for a new relief package. Indeed, Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska called the executive order \u00e2\u0080\u009cunconstitutional slop\u00e2\u0080\u009d in a statement on Sunday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPresident Obama did not have the power to unilaterally rewrite immigration law with DACA and President Trump does not have the power to unilaterally rewrite the payroll tax law,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Top Democratic senators Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer also piled on, releasing a statement calling the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions \u00e2\u0080\u009cunworkable, weak and narrow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Some experts told MarketWatch that they were skeptical whether the order would even bump up take-home money all that much per paycheck.

Trump announced last week that he was eyeing an executive order after Congress failed to compromise and pass a new coronavirus rescue package, even though using his executive power to provide economic aid over the legislative branch is a legal gray area.
