And Borat! Horror fans can look forward to \"Welcome to the Blumhouse,\" an anthology series of creepy genre movies that will drop a pair of double features in October: \"Black Box\" and \"The Lie\" (Oct. 6), and \"Evil Eye\" and \"Nocturne\" (Oct. 13). Expect tales of murder, deception and (bwahahaha) madness. div.youtube { height:0; position:relative; padding-bottom:56.25%; } div.youtube > iframe { position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; } If that's a little too intense, there's also \"Truth Seekers\" (Oct. 30), an eight-episode comedy series from Simon Pegg and Nick Frost (\"Shaun of the Dead\") about paranormal investigators, and \"Bug Diaries Halloween Special\" (Oct. 2), an animated kids show about friendly insects. div.youtube { height:0; position:relative; padding-bottom:56.25%; } div.youtube > iframe { position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; } Prime also has a ton of older scary movies coming, including \"30 Days of Night,\" \"John Carpenter's Vampires\" and \"The Grudge 3\" (all Oct. 1). Among non-Halloween fare, Amazon.com Inc.'s US:AMZN  streaming service will roll out \"Chasing the Crown: Dreamers to Streamers\" (Oct. 9), a competition series for Twitch videogame streamers; NFL football every Thursday starting Oct. 8; and fresh episodes of the ultraviolent superhero satire \"The Boys\" every Friday. Update: A surprise \"Borat\" sequel will drop on Amazon on Oct. 23. This could be big - the first installment of Sasha Baron Cohen's gonzo/reality comedy reaped more than $260 million at the box office in 2006. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } See: What's coming in October to Netflix | Hulu Also read:'The Mandalorian' returns, but what other streaming picks are worth paying for in October 2020?
