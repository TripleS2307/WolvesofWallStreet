AFP via Getty Images Shares in Tesco increased 4% on Tuesday, as the supermarket giant posted a 28.7% rise in first-half profit as shoppers bought more food during the pandemic and online sales doubled.

Tesco TSCO, +1.80%, Britain\u2019s largest grocer, which has outlets across Europe in Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, has also seen a change in shopping habits with people buying more items in fewer larger shopping trips in an attempt to avoid unnecessary trips out of the home. Its new chief executive Ken Murphy, who joined from Walgreens Boots Alliance WBA, -1.96% and is just one week into the job, said growth in the half was most marked in online, with sales up 69% and the rate of growth reaching 90% during the second quarter.
