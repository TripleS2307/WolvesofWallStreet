Analysts on average had expected 2020 revenue of about $8.4 billion, FactSet reported. When asked on the call why the outlook was raised, AMD president and CEO Lisa Su said \u201cdemand has gone up from our initial expectations\u201d and that the company sees better-than-expected PC sales in the second half of the year, along with continued data-center growth, and a ramp in gaming console sales.

Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, who thought AMD was being conservative earlier in the year, thinks sales have even more room to run. \u201cI believe this new forecast is conservative, as I think Epyc revenue will kick in even higher,\u201d Moorhead said.
