Rocket Cos., the parent of Quicken Loans, priced shares below expectations late Wednesday, with an offering of 100 million shares at $18 apiece, as first reported by The Wall Street Journal. The company had previously planned to sell 150 million shares at between $20 and $22 apiece. The stock is expected to start trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange. At the new price and number of shares sold, the IPO would raise about $1.8 billion. The debut had previously been expected to raise as much as $3.3 billion, which would have been the year\u2019s second-largest IPO behind only the $4 billion that hedge-fund billionaire William Ackman raised with his special-purpose acquisition company last month, according to Dealogic.
