Inc. shares closed up 18% Friday in their trading debut, after the company upsized and priced its initial public offering above its price range. The company raised about $765 million in the biggest initial public offering of the week. Late Thursday, the company priced its IPO at $23 a share, above its expected range of $19 to $21 each, offering 33.25 million shares to raise $764.8 million. The maker of low-maintenance but sustainable building materials for outdoor living is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \u201cAZEK.\u201d There were 14 underwriters on the deal, led by Barclays. The Chicago-based company AZEK, +1.24%, which used to be called CPG, says it will use proceeds to redeem debt and for general corporate purposes. \u201cWe are an industry-leading designer and manufacturer of beautiful, low-maintenance and environmentally sustainable products focused on the highly attractive, fast-growing outdoor living market,\u201d the company says in its prospectus. That category includes decks, rail, trim, wood and wood-look siding, porches, pavers, outdoor furniture, outdoor cabinetry and outdoor lighting. The company operates two divisions, TimberTech and Azek Exteriors. The former has a portfolio of capped polymer and capped composite decking, along with railing, porch, lighting and paver products. Azek Exteriors makes trim and moulding. The company has been around for 30 years and has manufacturing plants in Ohio and Pennsylvania and owns Minneapolis-based Ultralox railing systems.

Principia is a research and consulting firm. In the residential segment, the company sells products through a network of more than 4,000 dealers and more than 35 distributors and home-improvement retailers in the U.S. and Canada. The company\u2019s slogan supports its core values, of \u201calways do the right thing,\u201d according to the prospectus, one that might \u2014 in addition to recalling Google\u2019s former motto \u2014 appeal to a key target market. \u201cAs more members of the millennial generation purchase first homes in the United States, we expect the demand for outdoor living spaces will rise, and the appeal of low- to no-maintenance features to gain further momentum,\u201d says the prospectus. \u201cWe believe that consumers are increasingly environmentally conscious in their purchasing behaviors, and that our sustainable manufacturing practices and the high recycled content of our products address evolving consumer preferences.\u201d The prospectus acknowledges the challenges being posed by the coronavirus pandemic and says it has cut staff and tapped credit lines to tide it over. It also concedes that it has a heavy debt load at $1.2 billion.

That makes it a controlled company, limiting individual shareholders\u2019 say in how it is managed. Here are 5 things to know about Azek:It\u2019s loss-making, but peers are making money Azek posted a net loss of $5.8 million for the first six months of fiscal 2020 through March 31. That was narrower than the $20.8 million loss posted in the year-earlier period. Sales rose to $411.6 million from $357.4 million. Azek\u2019s main rival is Trex Inc. TREX, +2.47%, according to Renaissance Capital, a provider of institutional research and IPO ETFs. Trex posted net income of $42.4 million in the first quarter on sales of $200 million. That was up from net income of $31.6 million a year ago on sales of $179.6 million. Trex\u2019s stock has held up through the pandemic, and is up 30% in the year to date, outperforming benchmark indexes. Winchester, Va.\u2013based Trex has been publicly traded since 1999.Azek\u2019s financial profile is not strong Azek faces high default risk and poor core health, according to RapidRatings, a data and analytics company that assesses the financial health of private and public companies. An analysis of the company\u2019s financials assigned it a financial health rating, or FHR, of 35 on a scale of 1 to 100, for the four quarters ending Sept. 30, 2019. The FHR measures short-term resiliency and default risk. That puts Azek in the top half of RapidRatings\u2019 High Risk group, with an estimated probability of default of 1.59% over the next 12 months. \u201cThis FHR and the default risk level are the result of Poor Core Health and current weakness in leverage and earnings performance,\u201d said RapidRatings. Azek\u2019s Core Health Score, which measures medium-term risk and company efficiency, came to 24 out of 100, which \u201csuggests low levels of efficiency and a performance which is not sustainable over the long-term.\u201d The rating fell in the four-quarter period, \u201creflecting deterioration in the company\u2019s performance in net profitability and cost structure efficiency. Operating profitability, net profitability and capital structure efficiency are at low levels relative to the global data set.\u201dAzek is highly leveraged Azek has $1.2 billion in debt, which is equal to 64% of total assets, according to RapidRatings. The company\u2019s interest coverage was 0.71 times in 2019, meaning the company was unable to fully meet its interest obligations with operating profit. Interest expense rose to $83.2 million from $68.7 million. The prospectus acknowledges the risks the company would face if it is unable to generate sufficient cash to service its debt. \u201cOur inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. \u201cIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default, and the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities could terminate their commitments to loan money, the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. Any of these events could result in you losing all or a portion of your investment in the Class A common stock.\u201d James Gellert, chief executive of RapidRatings, noted the intended use of proceeds from the IPO is to pay down the company\u2019s 8% notes. \u201cThis should have a positive impact when they lower debt, but is an interesting item to note,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not unheard of for companies to use IPO proceeds to pay down debt, but It\u2019s less common with the IPOs you\u2019ve seen in recent years, where many are tech companies that are using new capital principally for growth and, frankly, to fund losses for years to come.\u201dAzek has material weaknesses in internal control of financial reporting \u201cAs of September 30, 2019, we determined that we have three material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting,\u201d says the prospectus. The first is related to maintaining an effective control environment, it explains, which is due to a lack of resources. \u201cThis material weakness contributed to an additional material weakness relating to the design and maintenance of formal accounting policies, procedures and controls,\u201d it says. The third material weakness \u201crelates to the design and maintenance of effective controls over certain information technology general controls,\u201d it says. It defines material weakness as \u201ca deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\u201d The company has taken steps to address the issue, hiring a new chief financial officer and a chief accounting officer, among other measures. Azek is going public in a highly uncertain environment For a business that relies on discretionary spending, Azek is going public at a highly uncertain time, with more than 40 million Americans out of work during the coronavirus pandemic. The company includes a detailed description of the risks stemming from COVID-19 in its risk factors. \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic, and the reactions of governmental and other authorities to contain, mitigate or combat the pandemic, which have severely restricted the level of economic activity around the world, have impacted, and are expected to continue to impact, our operations, and the nature, extent and duration of the impact of COVID-19 or any future disease or adverse health condition is highly uncertain and beyond our control,\u201d says the prospectus. The impact of the crisis is expected to be felt through the balance of fiscal 2020. The company is working with distributors to monitor market demand and ensure supply and inventory levels are appropriate. It expects that dealers, homeowners and industrial and commercial customers may delay new projects until the virus is contained. On a brighter note, the deal is coming at a time when the IPO market has been performing strongly. Deals that have hit the market this week and last, including Warner Music Group Corp. WMG, +0.54%, the biggest deal of the year so far, and online used-car site Vroom Inc. VRM, -0.26%, have chalked up strong gains. The Renaissance IPO ETF exchange-traded fund IPO, +1.98% has gained 19% in the year to date, easily outperforming the S&P 500, which is down 7% after Thursday\u2019s market rout. The ETF has been buoyed by the inclusion in the index of recent IPOs of digital companies and others that are benefiting from working-from-home products and services, such as Zoom Video Communications Inc. ZM, +2.89% and Slack Technologies Inc. WORK, +3.36%, and the biotech company Moderna Inc. MRNA, +0.09%, which is working on a COVID-19 vaccine.
