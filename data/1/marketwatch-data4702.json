The 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.777% fell 1.3 basis point to 0.606%, while the 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, 1.576% edged 0.5 basis lower to 1.313%. The 2-year note rate TMUBMUSD02Y, 0.156% was declined 0.6 basis point to 0.143%, around its lowest level in more than two months. What\u2019s driving Treasurys? EU leaders agreed to jointly borrow \u20ac750 billion ($857.8 billion) of funds for a fiscal stimulus package that would support the hardest hit economies in the 27-member economic bloc. An agreement was also reached on the EU\u2019s budget over the next seven years, amounting to \u20ac1074 billion. The deal will see \u20ac390 billion given as grants to individual countries, with the rest coming from loans, lower than the proposed \u20ac500 billion in grants. Investors had mostly anticipated a deal on the EU recovery fund, despite negotiations had stretched to five days. Even though Italy was set to secure 209 billion euros of funds, the 10-year Italian bond yield TMBMKIT-10Y, 0.722% held their ground at 1.09% Equities showed more of a response, with the Stoxx 600 Europe index SXXP, +0.55% gaining 0.3%. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% and Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% traded higher. Investors also eyed the Federal Reserve on Tuesday. The Senate Banking Committee voted to approve on the nominations of Judy Shelton, an early supporter and adviser to President Donald Trump, and Christopher Waller, head of economic research at the St. Louis Fed, to a seat on the Fed board of governors.What did market participants\u2019 say? \u201cA lot of the positive market reaction was priced in at the Merkel and Macron announcement\u201d in May, said Esty Dwek, head of global market strategy at Natixis Investment Managers, in an interview, after investors noted that Germany was on board with the recovery fund. \u201cThe fact that there are more grants is one of the biggest signals we\u2019ve had in years that Europe is sticking together and we\u2019re not leaving a country behind,\u201d she said."}]}
