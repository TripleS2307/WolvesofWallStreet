RXT, -1.99% plunged 22% on their first day of trading Wednesday. Four years after it went private, Rackspace announced pricing of its initial public offering: 33.5 million shares of common stock at $21 per share. But investors turned up their noses, leaving the stock at $16.39 at the close of trading. \"We're in the middle of a tectonic shift to multicloud technology,\" company Chief Executive Kevin Jones told MarketWatch in a Zoom interview early Wednesday. \"It is the right place, right time for our transformation. We used to compete with hyper-scalers in cloud like Amazon AMZN, +3.01%, Google GOOGL, +1.82% GOOG, +1.97%, and Microsoft MSFT, +2.48%. Now, we partner with them.\" Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC are serving as joint lead book-running managers of the IPO. Rackspace was taken private by Apollo Global Management in a $4.3 billion acquisition in 2016. Last year, Rackspace reported revenue of $2.44 billion and a loss of $102.3 million, compared with $2.45 billion in revenue and a loss of $470.6 million in 2018."}]}
