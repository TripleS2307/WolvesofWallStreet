In his first detailed statements on the U.S. presidential campaign, Putin also lamented President Donald Trump\u2019s failure to improve relations between Moscow and Washington but blamed this on a \u201cbipartisan consensus on the need to contain Russia, to curb our country\u2019s development.\u201d Putin\u2019s comments, to Russian state television, seemed intended to serve multiple purposes: playing to Trump\u2019s side by casting the Democrats in a pro-Moscow light, while at the same time hedging his bets by flirting with Biden\u2019s camp in case he wins. He said Biden\u2019s reference to Trump in last week\u2019s debate as \u201cPutin\u2019s puppy\u201d was in fact a compliment to Russia and \u201cactually enhances our prestige, because they are talking about our incredible influence and power.\u201d Russia-U.S. relations have sunk to post\u2013Cold War lows over Moscow\u2019s annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimea, the Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and other issues. Last month, Microsoft said that the same Russian military intelligence outfit that hacked the Democrats has attempted similar intrusions into the computer systems of more than 200 organizations, including political parties and consultants. While Putin again denied meddling in the U.S. election, U.S. intelligence officials believe Russia is using a variety of measures to denigrate Biden and that individuals linked to the Kremlin are boosting Trump\u2019s re-election bid.

The U.S.-Russian talks on extending the pact have produced no visible progress, and Russian diplomats said that chances for making a deal with the Trump administration look slim. \u201cThis is a very serious element of our potential collaboration in the future,\u201d Putin said, speaking on his 68th birthday. He added that Russia would be ready to work with any future U.S. president. Read on:Trump needs to go public with threats to election security, top Democrats say"}]}
