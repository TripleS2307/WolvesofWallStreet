The order President Donald Trump signed Aug. 8 allows employers to stop withholding the 6.2% payroll tax from Sept. 1 through Dec. 31. Employees must make under $4,000 every two weeks to qualify. Trump said the order was aimed at putting more money into Americans\u2019 pockets during the coronavirus outbreak. Small business owners are wary about the plan. The tax must still be paid between Jan. 1 and April 30 of next year, which means employees could take an unwanted financial hit or companies might ultimately have to pay the government if staffers leave. Attorney John Strohmeyer is having the payroll for his Houston firm processed as per usual. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make much sense. I\u2019m not getting a tax break as an employee or employer. The money is still due by April 30 of next year,\u201d Strohmeyer says. Jay Starkman says the businesses calling his human resources consulting firm for advice about tax deferral ask whether it\u2019s a good benefit for employees. But they\u2019re not inclined to implement the plan. \u201cIf the employee doesn\u2019t pay the money back, you\u2019re on the hook for it. Till that changes, it just doesn\u2019t make sense to give somebody a few more months of money,\u201d says Starkman, CEO of Engage PEO, based in Hollywood, Florida. Owners also have questions about the payment process that aren\u2019t answered in the guidelines the IRS issued last week. The three-page document is silent on how the money is to be collected after Jan. 1, leaving owners wondering if they would have to deduct it paycheck by paycheck or whether staffers would need to come up with a lump sum. Owners also don\u2019t know if they\u2019d have to poll staffers individually to see who wants or doesn\u2019t want their taxes deferred. While many companies use payroll processors or human resources consultants to handle staffers\u2019 pay, implementing a temporary tax deferral is still another layer of work for owners who are focused on running their companies during a pandemic. Strohmeyer says business owners would prefer to focus on changes that affect the long-term running of their companies. \u201cThis is a four-month delay. Why would you upset your business?\u201d Owners already see the possibility of a bureaucratic headache in tax deferral, says Karen Kerrigan, president of the advocacy group Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council. \u201cThe vast majority of small businesses will likely opt out due to complexity, and the fact that it puts owners or managers in an awkward position of collecting funds or deducting funds from employees\u2019 paychecks in the future, and these could be substantial amounts,\u201d she says. Owners are finding that employees aren\u2019t eager to defer their taxes. Attorney Arash Hashemi\u2019s sole staffer is looking down the road to paying the tax in 2021 and \u201cshe\u2019s afraid that will hurt her pocket more than it will help,\u201d he says. Hashemi, whose practice is in Los Angeles, is also saying \u201cno, thanks.\u201d \u201cI already have so many obligations to the government, not only federal but state and local. I don\u2019t want to make one more burden for the business,\u201d he says. Michael Kipness has surveyed his five staffers and found that \u201cthey\u2019re very concerned about having to pay this back later.\u201d His financial advisers tell him that the IRS guidance about the tax deferral is confusing. \u201cWe will continue to withhold it, as there\u2019s too much uncertainly right now,\u201d says Kipness, CEO of Wizard Race and Sports, a company that gives sports gamblers analyses of races and games. Payroll processor ADP is ready to adjust its computer systems to stop withholding the tax if companies request it, says Pete Isberg, the company\u2019s vice president for government affairs. But so far, there\u2019s little interest, Isberg says. \u201cA lot of businesses are looking at this and saying, \u2018I don\u2019t think so,\u2019\u201d Isberg says."}]}
