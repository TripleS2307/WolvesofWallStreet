My father-in-law is selfish. My brother-in-law is amoral. How do we protect our inheritance?", "body": "Dear Moneyist, My in-laws are difficult: My mother-in-law is bipolar and narcissistic. My father-in-law is entirely selfish, and my brother-in-law is pretty amoral and lacks scruples. Trust me on this. My father-in-law and mother-in-law live on my brother-in-law\u2019s farm in Florida. My parents-in-law pay for lifestyle expenses, utilities, animal feed, vet bills, etc., and consistently \u201cloan\u201d money to my brother-in-law without hope of repayment. By the way, my brother-in-law is a multimillionaire (although cash poor) and hasn\u2019t worked in 10 years. My father-in-law was a New York City teacher and draws an annual pension worth six figures. Through a lifetime of spending at or beyond their financial limits, my parents-in-law have acquired several valuable pieces (art, antique furniture, etc.) and, due to my father-in-law\u2019s pension, have a few hundred thousand dollars in the bank. The Moneyist:\u2018He doesn\u2019t give me any money\u2019: My husband has been making secret payments to his parents. Should I tell him to stop? My husband, who is wonderful and responsible, and I are expecting our first child. (We\u2019re so excited.) My husband has asked his father to draw up a will that would exclude us but protect the inheritance of his future grandchild. We both expect that his brother will end up draining my in-laws dry and taking everything valuable for himself. My father-in-law refused to create a will, saying \u201cnot to worry about it\u201d and assuring us everything would work out fine. Obviously, that\u2019s no comfort at all. As an aside, my mother-in-law has dementia and relies on her husband as a caretaker; we cannot rely on her help in this matter at all. What can we do to protect the inheritance of our future child? In the absence of a will, would my FIL\u2019s estate be divided evenly between his two children? How can we make sure that my brother-in-law doesn\u2019t drain his parents dry? Thank you, Concerned for my child The Moneyist: \u2018We bet on the wrong horse\u2019: I co-signed my nephew\u2019s $55K student loan: He has no degree and no job. What should we do? Dear Mother, I am #TeamFIL. Imagine, for a moment, that you sent this letter to your father-in-law instead of me. What would he think? You lost me on this line: \u201cMy mother-in-law has dementia and relies on her husband as a caretaker; we cannot rely on her help in this matter at all.\u201d If you see your mother-in-law\u2019s dementia as an impediment to you and your husband securing your inheritance and/or your child\u2019s inheritance \u2014 they are essentially the same thing in this situation \u2014 the problem lies not with your in-laws, but with you. Your in-laws have made smart financial decisions in their lives. I trust your father-in-law to make smart decisions in relation to his estate. He may or may not have a will. He may or may not leave money to you and your husband and child. His money. His choice. Trying to control the behavior of others is a fool\u2019s game. It can start with your in-laws\u2019 estate and trickle all the way down to the person standing in line in front of you at the bank: \u201cWhy can\u2019t they move faster? Why can\u2019t they take me into account? Why can\u2019t they do what I want?\u201d It is a one-way ticket to a life of anger and frustration where everyone except for you is the problem. If everyone else is the problem \u2014 your \u201cselfish\u201d father-in-law, your \u201cnarcissistic\u201d mother-in-law, your \u201camoral\u201d brother-in-law \u2014 then you\u2019re the problem. The Moneyist: My wife had a baby in June. She has $160,000 in student loans \u2014 and just asked for my \u2018blessing\u2019 to work part time Every dollar and cent that goes to helping your brother-in-law is a dollar and cent that does not go to you. It sounds like a frustrating and infuriating situation for you. But it is one entirely of your own making. It\u2019s your father-in-law\u2019s money, his son, his relationship, his business. He may have a will. He may not. But one way to control who your father-in-law leaves his money to in his will, assuming he does have one, is to keep making his business your business, and to keep casting judgment on everyone else in your family except yourself. If I were your father-in-law, I might want to continue helping people after I\u2019m gone. If he is taking care of his wife now, he could leave his estate to the Alzheimer\u2019s Foundation of America or Dementia Society of America, which help elderly people like your mother-in-law. When you try to control other people\u2019s actions and spend your time persuading them to see the world from your point of view, you are effectively playing God. That is probably the most impossible role to play in this life. Play the role of wife, mother, friend and kind daughter-in-law instead. Living a life where you want nothing from anyone is a freeing and happy place to be. You have a child on the way. Your husband cares about you, and it sounds like you think the world of him. You have many good things in your life. Focus on those non-monetary gifts instead. Be #TeamFIL too. You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com.
