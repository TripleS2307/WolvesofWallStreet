Shortly afterwards, the president drove by cheering supporters outside the hospital. He was barely visible in the back of the car, waving from the back seat while wearing a black mask, and giving the crowd a thumbs-up. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting great reports from the doctors,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said in a video on Twitter while standing, dressed in a white shirt and navy blue suit. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is an incredible hospital, Walter Reed. The work they do is just absolutely amazing, and I want to thank them all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d (He also released a video from the hospital on Saturday.)

His medical regimen highlighted how the president is in a high-risk group for more serious illness from COVID-19. He appeared upbeat on Sunday evening. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also gotten to meet some of the soldiers and first responders and what a group,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI also think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to pay a little surprise to some of the great patriots we have on the street, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been out there for a long time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump suggested he would pay them a visit. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got Trump flags and they love our country, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not telling anybody but you, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m about to make a surprise visit so perhaps I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get there before you get to see me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.

I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned a lot about COVID. I learned it by really going to school.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is the real school,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the \u00e2\u0080\u0098let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s read the book\u00e2\u0080\u0099 school, and I get it and I understand it, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very interesting thing and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to be letting you know about it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He signed off: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the meantime, we love the USA, and we love what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening.

Worldwide, there has been at least 35,011,322 confirmed cases, which mostly does not account for asymptomatic cases. Several companies in the U.S. and overseas are working on a vaccine.

MERK, +1.59% ; Moderna MRNA, +0.09% ; and Sanofi SAN, -1.48% \u00c2 are among those working to get a vaccine through trials, in the hope one will be ready in and/or by 2021."}]}
