Nearly all election procedures are governed on a state-by-state basis, with the remainder set by Congress or enshrined in the Constitution. There is no precedent or apparent authority for Trump to try to curtail the use of mail-in ballots by executive order, though he could use a document to formalize his opposition to the practice. Trump\u2019s claimed authority comes days after he publicly floated a delay to the Nov. 3 presidential election, a notion was met with swift bipartisan blowback. Trump has increasingly sought to cast doubt on November\u2019s election and the expected pandemic-induced surge in mail-in and absentee voting \u2014 particularly as he has found himself trailing in public and private polling. Trump has called remote voting options the \u201cbiggest risk\u201d to his reelection. His campaign and the Republican Party have sued to combat the practice, which was once a significant advantage for the GOP. There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud through mail-in voting and the states that use it exclusively say they have necessary safeguards in place to ensure that a hostile foreign actor doesn\u2019t disrupt the vote. Election security experts say voter fraud is rare in all forms of balloting, including by mail. In addition to his claims of fraud, Trump argued that voting by mail would delay the determination of the election\u2019s victor, noting that the winner of a New York Democratic congressional primary vote conducted by mail weeks ago remains undeclared. Trump said he believes that race would need to be \u201crerun.\u201d Trump claimed the challenge would be greater in a presidential election, where the Electoral College could come down to just one state, and some states allow mail-in ballots to be received up to a week after Election Day. \u201cYou\u2019ll never know who won that state,\u201d Trump said Monday of Nevada\u2019s expansion of mail voting."}]}
