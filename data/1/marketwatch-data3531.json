If you\u2019re worried about such a top-heavy market \u2014 don\u2019t. The current market share of the five largest stocks is actually below the market\u2019s long-term average. Those five biggest stocks by market capitalization currently are Microsoft MSFT, +2.48% , Apple AAPL, +1.74% , Alphabet GOOGL, +1.82% , Amazon.com AMZN, +3.01% , and Facebook FB, +0.26% . The problem with comparing this market to the internet boom is that the argument doesn\u2019t go back far enough. While the largest five stocks now represent a greater share of the total market than at any time over the past two decades, that share is far lower than what was seen in prior decades. The data come from Dimensional Fund Advisors, and are plotted in the chart below. Since 1927, the share of the total stock market represented by the five largest stocks has averaged 17%, which means the latest value is slightly below the long-term average. As the firm notes, \u201cthe fact that a small subset of companies\u2019 stocks account for an outsized portion of the stock market is not new\u2026. [It] is not a new normal; it is old normal.\u201d To be sure, just because what we\u2019re seeing now is not unprecedented doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a sign of market health. To find out, I input into my PC\u2019s statistical program the data in the accompanying chart, along with the S&P 500\u2019s SPX, +0.87% inflation-adjusted total return. I was searching for any correlations between the five largest companies\u2019 share of market cap and the market\u2019s return over the subsequent 1-, 5- and 10-year periods. I came up empty. That means we can draw no conclusions about the stock market\u2019s likely future return from the share of the market invested in the five largest stocks. To be sure, I would have reached a different conclusion if I had focused solely on data since the 1990s. But that just illustrates, yet again, the need to look at as much historical data as possible when trying to draw inferences for the future.Losing steam Unfortunately, we can\u2019t be as optimistic about the performance prospects for the largest companies themselves. The DFA study found that after becoming one of the 10 largest companies, their stocks on average lag the market over the five- and 10 years. The data are summarized below: Return relative to overall market (annualized) Over 1 year after becoming one of the 10 largest stocks +0.7% Over 5 years after becoming one of the 10 largest stocks -1.1% Over ten years after becoming one of the 10 largest stocks -1.5% The implication of both results is that, over the next decade, other stocks are likely to replace the current top five. This is the \u201ccreative destruction\u201d that is the hallmark of capitalism. Just ask shareholders of General Electric GE, +2.85% ; it was the largest stock in the S&P 500 for five of the first six years of this century. Over the past four years, the stock has lost 77% of its value, and is now the 65th largest company in the S&P 500. Mark Hulbert is a regular contributor to MarketWatch.
