China on Friday ordered the U.S. to close its consulate in the western city of Chengdu, the latest salvo in a dispute between Washington and Beijing. The U.S. earlier this week ordered China to close its Houston consulate, alleging Chinese agents had tried to steal data from facilities in Texas. Tensions between the two of the world\u2019s economic superpowers \u201cprompted a risk-off move in markets,\u201d analysts at UBS wrote in a research note dated Friday. The analysts said that while they expect gold to continue \u201cto be supported by rising geopolitical tensions,\u201d they believe the \u201cprimary drivers of the gold price are its negative correlation to real interest rates and the dollar.\u201d Those factors, \u201cin combination with limited supply growth as miners continue to restrain capex spending, will drive gold prices higher,\u201d they said. August gold GC00, +2.17% US:GCQ20, the most actively traded contract on Comex, climbed by $7.50, or 0.4%, to settle at $1,897.50 an ounce. That surpassed the all-time closing high of $1,891.90 for a most active contract set in August 2011, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Read:\u2018I would be buying now and continue to buy\u2019 gold, says Mark Mobius investing pioneer \u201cThe active August futures contract has still failed to break out to a fresh record [intraday] high north of $1,923,\u201d said Richey. \u201cBased on the bullish fundamentals, which include a downward trending dollar and falling real yields, it is only a matter of time until we see new all time highs though.\u201d The all-time intraday high for a most actively traded contract stands at $1,923.70 an ounce from Sept. 6, 2011. On Friday, August gold climbed to as high as $1,904.60. The price move comes as the front-month contract notched a fresh all-time high for a second session. The front-month July gold contract US:GCN20, which trades on much lower volume, rose $8.20, or 0.4%, to $1,897.30 on Friday. That was a record for the front-month contracts, based on data going back to 1975.

Read:Why silver is trading at a nearly 4-year high For the week, based on the most-active contracts, gold futures saw a 4.8% gain, while silver surged 15.6%. \u201cThe sheer magnitude of economic stimulus already delivered, and to be distributed on a continuing basis, is filtering through the precious metals markets,\u201d said Ryan Giannotto, director of research at GraniteShares, which offers the GraniteShares Gold Trust BAR, +1.88%. \u201cWhile gold is inches from its 2011 all time high, silver is not even halfway to its previous highwater mark of $50\u201d an ounce, but \u201cbeen explosive retaking ground,\u201d he told MarketWatch. \u201cCuriously, gold and silver have emerged neck and neck for the title of best-performing asset class of 2020, up 24% and 27% [year to date], respectively, notwithstanding the latter\u2019s 38% collapse in price through February and March,\u201d said Giannotto. \u201cPerhaps the best way to conceive of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet expansion is a tax on cash,\u201d he explained. \u201cIn such an environment, monetary metals may be expected to sharply rally not only as a potential dollar hedge, but as alternative stores of value in their own right.\u201d In other metals action, September copper US:HGU20 fell 1.6% to $2.8925 a pound, ending around 0.4% lower for the week. October platinum PLV20, +3.99% lost 0.8% to $956 an ounce, but saw a weekly rise of more than 12%, while September palladium US:PAU20 settled at $2,294.10 an ounce, up 2.4%, for a weekly rise of nearly 11%. The gold-backed SPDR Gold Trust GLD, +1.81% traded up 0.8%, poised for a gain of 5% for the week."}]}
