Most retirees regret not saving more. A 2018 study by Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies found 73% wish they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d put aside more money on a consistent basis, and half felt they waited too long to get serious about retirement saving. But retirement is about more than the balance in your 401(k).\u00c2 Even people with sizable nest eggs can wish\u00c2 they handled certain aspects of retirement differently. Hoping to learn from others\u00e2\u0080\u0099 mistakes, I asked advisers with the Financial Planning Association and the Alliance of Comprehensive Planners to share their clients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 biggest regrets about retirement. Thirty-one advisers responded, and their answers revealed some common themes. Among them:\u00e2\u0080\u0098I wish we had traveled more while we could\u00e2\u0080\u0099 All too often, health issues derail people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s travel plans, says certified financial planner Serina Shyu of Atlanta. They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get around to taking that dream trip or get to see as many places as they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d hoped. Even homebodies regret missed chances to see loved ones. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnother version is where the health issue isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t [the retiree\u00e2\u0080\u0099s]. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I wish we had gone to see so-and-so,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d says CFP Daniel B. Moisand of Melbourne, Florida. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSometimes we wait to reconnect with friends or family and that person dies or suffers a stroke or dementia.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Financial planners\u00c2 can help people get clarity about how much money they can safely spend in retirement. CFP Linda Y. Leitz of Colorado Springs, Colorado, says she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been able to reassure several clients so they could get started on their bucket lists. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs they aged and either had health concerns or just didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enjoy being away from home as much, they all were really glad that they traveled,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Leitz says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind cutting back in later years because they had done the things that were important to them, early in retirement, while they could enjoy them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0098I wish I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d had something to retire to\u00e2\u0080\u0099 People can be so tired of working, or sick of their particular job, that they\u00c2 retire\u00c2 at the first opportunity without thinking through how they will spend their time. Many struggle to replace the structure, meaning and purpose their work provided. Also on MarketWatch: Retiree warning: History suggests we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re overdue for a bear market \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey look back five or six years after they have retired to realize the time has flown by and they have not done anything,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says CFP Jonathan P. Bednar of Knoxville, Tennessee. CFP Jennifer Weber of Lake Success, New York, counsels her clients to think about \u00e2\u0080\u009chow to spend their days with meaning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That could mean a part-time job, consulting gigs, volunteering or spending more time with friends and family, she says.\u00e2\u0080\u0098I wish I had more friends\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Something else work provides: social contact. People often don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t realize how much social interaction their workplace provides, says CFP Patti B. Black of Birmingham, Alabama. Black recommends volunteer groups, clubs and classes as potential sources of new friends. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople may feel \u00e2\u0080\u0098out of the loop\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in retirement,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Black says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt takes time and effort to find a new tribe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0098I wish we hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bought that house\u00e2\u0080\u0099 CFP Kevin M. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Brien of Northborough, Massachusetts, says some of his clients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 retirement home purchases triggered serious buyer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remorse. The clients hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t spent enough time in the community before buying, and now wish they lived somewhere else. The cost and stress of changing homes is usually significant. Although moving may be the right choice, no one should buy a retirement home in haste, O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Brien says.

O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Brien has advised couples where one spouse was thrilled to be the grandkids\u00e2\u0080\u0099 child care provider while the other longed to travel and be more spontaneous. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just up and go because they are relied on to watch the grandchildren,\u00e2\u0080\u009d O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Brien says. Different expectations can cause serious ruptures in relationships, and they may be among the reasons why divorce rates for people 55 and older have more than doubled since 1990 even as the overall divorce rate subsides, Black says. Black urges spouses to discuss how they will spend their time, including how the division of household chores might change and even whether they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have lunch together every day. As with so many other aspects of marriage, the willingness to talk through disagreements and find compromises is essential, she says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRetirement is a major life transition, and you have to be patient with yourself and your spouse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Black says.More from NerdWallet: 4 Things to Know if You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve Never Budgeted Before Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Shop This Way in 2020 Equifax Breach: Claims Cutoff and More Scammers Ahead Liz Weston is a writer at NerdWallet.
