Even with that possible volume, reported sightings of the much-maligned creatures have fallen by one-fifth during the coronavirus pandemic. Fewer sightings is more a reflection of the city being shut down during the coronavirus pandemic than a drastic fall in rat population. In fact, when the city gets closer to normal activity, their numbers could jump. In the three months between March 22 \u2014 the start of New York\u2019s statewide Pause order which closed down all nonessential business \u2014 and June 22, New York City\u2019s 311 service recorded 4,003 rat sightings across the five boroughs, led by Brooklyn, which had the most reported. The number is a 20.8% decline from the 5,056 reports that were made in the same period last year, according to data from the city. The falls were most pronounced in Manhattan, where they fell 24.9%, and in Brooklyn, down 24.5%.

Instead, the slump in 311 reports is \u201cmore of a reflection of what we\u2019re living through than a rat decline,\u201d he said. \u201cMost people are so preoccupied these days with the drama we\u2019re going through,\u201d Corrigan said. \u201cNow seeing a rat on the street, or running down Broadway, is not the biggest deal.\u201d In the midst of a global pandemic, the \u201cnuisance of rats has taken on a pretty minor role in people\u2019s minds,\u201d he added. Rats are likely relocating too, further explaining the fall in reported sightings across the city. Many are likely to have turned to \u201cbasic living,\u201d which for rats, happens to be the sewers, where they\u2019re protected and where there is food that drifts by, according to Corrigan. \u201cRat numbers would not have dropped immediately,\u201d Jason Munshi-South, an urban evolutionary biologist and associate professor at Fordham University, wrote in an email. Though he expects \u201cmoderately lower rat numbers through 2020.\u201d \u201cWith the shutdown of many restaurants and offices, food supplies would have dried up for rats living in areas that are primarily commercial,\u201d he said. In areas with less food, rats would not have the resources needed to reproduce as much as they normally would in areas with more food. Also see: Even with reopening, New York still faces a future that looks very different However, when the city, and those food supplies, return to normal, \u201cthe rat population has the opportunity to rebound fairly quickly,\u201d he said. Part of the reason rats are so prolific, is that \u201cthey have a very fast rate of reproduction when resources are abundant and easily available,\u201d according to Corrigan. \u201cLots of resources means lots of kids.\u201d Their numbers may be further buoyed in the future by a weaker effort than normal to control them, a result of the financial strain that the pandemic has put on the city, Munshi-South said. The city, facing $9 billion in lost revenue, recently agreed to an $88.1 billion budget, roughly $5 billion less than last year\u2019s, with cuts across citywide sectors. \u201cI expect that the amount spent on rat control by the city of New York, and by the private sector, will both decline,\u201d Munshi-South said. What won\u2019t happen though, is the arrival of larger, or more aggressive rats as a result of coronavirus lockdowns. Coming out of this situation, \u201cI don\u2019t think the rats are going to be any different,\u201d Corrigan said. \u201cThe biggest [misconception] is that they\u2019re getting more brazen, more daring and they\u2019re not afraid of people.\u201d \u201cAre they evolving? The answer is no. That takes hundreds of years.\u201d"}]}
