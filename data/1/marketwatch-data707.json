The CDC\u2019s moratorium will apply to all rental units nationwide until Dec. 31 and goes into effect immediately, senior administration officials said of an unpublished CDC agency order. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told a U.S. House of Representatives panel Tuesday that the moratorium would cover around 40 million renters. A previous federal eviction moratorium created by the CARES Act ended in late July and only applied to federally-funded housing, including rental units with mortgages backed by Fannie Mae FNMA, +0.73% and Freddie Mac FMCC, +0.52% . The moratorium will apply to any state in which there is not already a more protective ban in effect, according to the order. Multiple states have eviction moratoriums in place, including California, which established new rules in a late-night vote Monday. Renters will be eligible for the moratorium\u2019s protection if they received an economic impact payment, or stimulus check, as provided for by the CARES Act. Therefore, single renters must earn no more than $99,000 a year, while couples filing jointly can earn up to $198,000 annually. \u201c Around 40 million people will be covered by the nationwide eviction moratorium, according to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. \u201d The order, which was shared ahead of being published in the Federal Register on Sept. 4, includes a declaration for renters to sign and give their landlord. Senior Trump administration officials said the form would be made available on the CDC\u2019s website. Renters must indicate on the declaration that they cannot afford to pay their rent in full and that if evicted they would become homeless or force to move into congregate housing. Renters also must be able to prove that they made an effort to receive government assistance and that they could not afford rent. The moratorium does not absolve renters of paying the rent. That money is still due to landlords, and senior administration officials said that renters should still attempt to make partial payments when they cannot afford to pay in full. Landlords will still be permitted to evict tenants in certain cases, such as instances in which the tenant has destroyed property or poses a threat to the health or safety of neighbors. The moratorium builds on a previous executive order from President Donald Trump that directed the Department of Health and Human Services and the CDC to determine whether halting evictions was necessary to contain the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. \u201cIn the context of a pandemic, eviction moratoria \u2014 like quarantine, isolation, and social distancing \u2014 can be an effective public health measure utilized to prevent the spread of communicable disease,\u201d the CDC\u2019s unpublished order said. \u201cPresident Trump is committed to helping hardworking Americans stay in their homes and combating the spread of the coronavirus,\u201d White House deputy press secretary Brian Morgenstern said during a briefing Tuesday. \u201c \u2018While an eviction moratorium is an essential step, it is a half-measure that extends a financial cliff for renters to fall off of when the moratorium expires and back rent is owed.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Diane Yentel, president and CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition Housing advocates said the move was \u201clong overdue,\u201d but called for more help to be provided to renters facing financial difficulties amid historically high levels of unemployment caused by the pandemic. \u201cAs we have said for five months, the very least the federal government ought to do is assure each of us that we won\u2019t lose our homes in the middle of a global pandemic: The administration\u2019s action would do so and will provide relief from the growing threat of eviction for millions of anxious families,\u201d said Diane Yentel, president and CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. \u201cBut while an eviction moratorium is an essential step, it is a half-measure that extends a financial cliff for renters to fall off of when the moratorium expires and back rent is owed,\u201d Yentel added, while calling on Congress to pass another COVID-19 relief bill with at least $100 billion in emergency rental assistance. Previously, some lawmakers and activists called for a cancellation of rent during the pandemic. Trump administration officials during Tuesday\u2019s briefing said that renters and landlords would have access to emergency funds already in place, including billions of dollars in grants from the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the $142 billion coronavirus relief fund from the Treasury Department. Administration officials could not clarify whether the CDC moratorium would prevent eviction filings from occurring. Housing and legal advocates have raised concerns that landlords filed evictions against many people nationwide who should have been protected by the CARES Act moratorium."}]}
