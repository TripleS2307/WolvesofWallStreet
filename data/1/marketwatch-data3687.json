The Mahwah, New Jersey-based company said it expects to reduce debt by about $1 billion in its pre-arranged restructuring, providing increased financial flexibility to become profitable. \"The meaningful progress we have made driving sustainable growth, improving our operating margins and strengthening our financial foundation has been severely disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic,\" Interim Executive Chair Carrie Teffner said in a statement. \"As a result, we took a strategic step forward today to protect the future of the business for all of our stakeholders.\" Ann Taylor, Loft, Lane Bryant and other chains will continue to operate through the restructuring with about 95% of stores open. But the company will reduce its footprint by closing a significant number of Justice stores and certain Ann Taylor, LOFT, Lane Bryant and Lou & Grey stores. \"This includes the exit of all stores across brands in Canada, Puerto Rico and Mexico and the closure of all Catherines stores,\" said the statement. Ascena has $150 million in funding from existing lenders and expects that sum combined with cash flow generated by ongoing operations and cash on hand to be sufficient to meet its needs. Shares, which are trading below a dollar, tumbled 27% premarket, and have fallen 90% in the year to date, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% has gained 1.4%."}]}
