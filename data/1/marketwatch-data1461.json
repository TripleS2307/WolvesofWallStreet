There was just one deal in Europe over $10 billion in the three months from April to June, when Spain\u2019s Telef\u00f3nica TEF, -0.51% and U.S. tycoon John Malone\u2019s cable group Liberty Global merged their U.K. operations in a $12.8 billion deal to create a new television and mobile company with a combined value of almost \u00a328 billion ($35bn). In total across Europe, there were just 1,958 mergers and acquisitions deals unveiled in Europe during the second quarter, according to data from Refinitiv, as the continent was forced into lockdown and executives focused on ensuring their companies\u2019 survival during the fallout from the pandemic. This marked the lowest number of deals since the first quarter of 1997. Read:Cash Is King \u2014 and M&A Goes MIA The value of deals, $182.9bn, was the lowest second quarter total since 2016. However, this was skewed by one transaction \u2014 Unilever\u2019s ULVR, +0.70% move in June to abandon its dual Anglo-Dutch corporate structure and become a single holding company based in the U.K. Refinitiv counted this as a $106.9bn deal. Excluding the Unilever deal, the value of European M&A in the second quarter declined by 62% in 2020 compared with the same period last year. The slump in Europe came amid a broader collapse in global deal making, the value of which plunged by 55% compared with the same period last year. \u201cBefore the crisis hit, there were a large number of deals that were due to come to market that were put on hold, so not surprisingly there has been a meaningful slowdown in M&A activity,\u201d said Alison Harding-Jones, head of M&A for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Citigroup C, +0.47%.

In the U.S. \u2014 the biggest market for M&A deals in the world \u2014 the value of deals slipped to a 17-year low to $103.5bn, an 85% decline on the same period last year. That included European food delivery service Just Eat Takeaway\u2019s TKWY, +1.00% $7.4bn takeover of US-based app Grubhub GRUB, +0.83% to create the world\u2019s largest food delivery service outside China. So far this year, the value of deals worldwide dropped 41% after several big-ticket acquisitions were struck in the first quarter just before the pandemic went global. These included insurer Aon\u2019s AON, +0.53% $30.1bn purchase of rival Willis Towers Watson WLTW, +0.17% in March and Morgan Stanley\u2019s MS, -0.34% $13.1bn acquisition of online brokerage E*Trade US:ETFC in February. Conversations in boardrooms have gradually restarted in recent weeks, as companies gain more clarity on the outlook for revenues for the rest of the year. \u201cAfter the volatility of March and April, clients have got a handle on liquidity and have a clearer view of what the rest of the year is likely to hold. Boards are thinking strategically about what this means for them and our engagement with clients has rarely been higher,\u201d Cathal Deasy, head of Emea M&A at Credit Suisse CS, -0.94%, said. \u201cThere have been clear winners from the crisis, either in particular industries or players who are stronger. This confidence has been recognized in the boardroom and people are looking to move forward to capitalize on that strength,\u201d he added. The reemergence of shareholder activists, who had initially retreated from agitating for change to give companies breathing space, could also kick-start M&A. In response to activist threats, companies whose stock-market valuations have fallen in recent weeks have rushed to shore up their takeover defenses and fend off hostile bids by adopting poison pills. These shareholder-rights plans allow existing shareholders to buy preferred shares at a substantial discount, thereby diluting the stake of a bidder and making a takeover more expensive.

It has been a big driver of M&A activity over the past two years and we expect that to continue to be a theme,\u201d said Dirk Albersmeier, co-head of M&A at J.P. Morgan JPM, -0.57% Megadeals have been scarce since the crisis began. There were just 13 transactions over $10bn so far this year \u2014 down by 60% globally. Senior bankers expect this to return as the crisis shakes out sectors. \u201cLooking back to the last financial crisis, there were over a dozen, big transformative deals in the aftermath and we expect the same to happen over the next 12 to 18 months,\u201d J.P. Morgan\u2019s Albersmeier said. \u201cIt\u2019s inevitable that we will see some large transactions over the next year,\u201d added Citi\u2019s Harding-Jones. \u201cCompanies will need to reposition themselves after COVID-19 when it will perhaps not be entirely clear where growth will come from. Boards will need to respond to that and M&A will be at the forefront.\u201d Private equity could also help boost deal making as they look to deploy the $1.5 trillion of dry powder \u2014 or uninvested capital \u2014 they have amassed, according to data from capital market company Preqin. Read:Private equity returns are rising. That may not last. \u201cIn the initial phase of the crisis, the key focus of private-equity firms was understandably on securing the health and liquidity of their portfolio companies,\u201d said Ina De, co-head of the strategic investors group in Emea at JPMorgan. \u201cBut now, it\u2019s clear the focus has rapidly moved to deploying their dry powder. Helping look for opportunities to invest is a top priority and we are spending a great deal of our time identifying appealing assets for our clients to buy.\u201d In the advisory league tables, Citi has gained the most during the first half of the year, leapfrogging rival JPMorgan to sit in third place, up from fifth at the same point last year. It advised on $202.6bn worth of deals, while Goldman Sachs GS, -0.21% maintained its top spot in the first half of 2020, advising on $258.1bn of transactions."}]}
