Before that, Washington delivered a mid-March package costing an estimated $192 billion, and an $8 billion measure that was finalized in early March. Other analysts see a similar timeline for the upcoming relief measure, after it previously was expected in June and then late July. \u201cIt continues to be our base case expectation that this bill will pass in the first week of August, likely after the $600/week booster UI payments have expired, but there is a very long time between now and then and plenty could happen in the interim,\u201d said Henrietta Treyz, director of economic policy research at Veda Partners, referring to enhanced unemployment insurance that\u2019s going away. \u201cThe bill could pass next week (a low probability event at the moment), or they could pass the week of August 10th, something House Democrats are specifically prepared to incur.\u201d See:The extra $600 in unemployment benefits \u2018gave people a real lifeline,\u2019 Trump says, so \u2018we\u2019re doing it again\u2019 but in smaller increments And read:Pelosi opens door to no August break for House if next coronavirus relief bill isn\u2019t done Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his fellow Republicans have said they expect the next measure to include coronavirus-related liability protections for businesses, another round of direct payments for households, an extension of the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses and $105 billion for schools to help them deal with the virus and reopen. But Senate Republicans have moved more slowly than expected in releasing the text of their Phase 4 legislation. \u201cThis slow rolling pushes negotiations around a final bill further into next week, potentially delaying final passage beyond the very early August timeline we have been expecting,\u201d said Height Capital Markets analysts in a note on Thursday.

U.S. stocks SPX, +0.87% DJIA, +0.56% are trading below their February peaks after the coronavirus pandemic triggered the shutdown of businesses, but they have rallied from their March lows thanks in part to optimism around Washington\u2019s aid efforts.
