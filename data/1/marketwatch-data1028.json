That\u2019s not what happened. Speakers at the Republican National Convention also hailed Trump for protecting the health insurance of people with preexisting illness, flipping reality on its head as his administration tries to overturn the law that guarantees those protections. A look at how some of the rhetoric from the convention\u2019s third night compares with the facts: On the economy Mike Pence: \u201cFour years ago we inherited ... an economy struggling to break out of the slowest recovery since the Great Depression. ... In our first three years we built the greatest economy in the world.\u201d The facts: That\u2019s a highly misleading portrait. Obama started the longest expansion in U.S. history and prevailed over most of it. The expansion was indeed slow, but growth under Trump has basically been the same: 2.3% in the final four years of Obama compared with 2.5% in the first three years of Trump. Trump took office with unemployment at a low 4.7%, steady job growth and a falling federal budget deficit. \u201c Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden does not propose defunding the police, and has said so explicitly, but rather giving them more money, conditioned on improvements in policing practices. \u201d And Trump\u2019s record on economic growth is about to get crushed by the current recession brought on by the pandemic, a public health crisis that the White House said early on would not hurt the economy. Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota: \u201cIn just four years, President Trump has lifted people of all races and backgrounds out of poverty. He shrunk government and put money back into the pockets of hardworking, ordinary Americans.\u201d The facts: Only this is true: Many Americans did get money back in the form of tax cuts and in direct government payments after the economy plunged into a recession this year as the coronavirus pandemic set in. Everything else is wrong. The government is still huge, not shrinking, as Noem said. Federal spending was 20.6% of gross domestic product in 2016, Obama\u2019s last year, according to the White House Office of Management and Budget. That percentage has gone up and down but was 20.8% in 2019. It probably surged this year due to the fastest and sharpest downturn in modern U.S. history. The pandemic-induced recession has also flung millions of Americans back into poverty \u2014 as expanded government aid has expired. The unemployment rate is 10.2%, versus 4.7% when Trump took office. There are 14.8 million Americans collecting jobless aid, while just 2 million were doing so when Trump became president. See:Weekly U.S. initial jobless claims fall to 1 million and have been at or above the million mark every week but one since the advent of the pandemic On policing Pence: \u201cWhen asked whether he\u2019d support cutting funding to law enforcement, Joe Biden replied, \u2018Yes, absolutely.\u2019 Under President Trump, we will always stand with those who stand on the thin blue line, and we\u2019re not going to defund the police.\u201d The facts: That\u2019s misleading, reliant upon a selective use of Biden\u2019s words on the subject. Biden does not propose defunding the police, and has said so explicitly, but rather giving them more money, conditioned on improvements in policing practices. Biden\u2019s actual position on this has been ignored at the GOP convention. Pence is referring to an excerpted video clip of Biden\u2019s conversation with the liberal activist Ady Barkan. In the fuller conversation, Biden declined to support defunding police, his consistent stance. Don\u2019t miss:Fact checking the Republican claim that Biden plans to defund the police, and Biden\u2019s claim that Trump put brake on coronavirus tests Barkan raised the issue of police reform and asked whether Biden would funnel money into social services, mental health counseling and affordable housing to help reduce civilian interactions with police. Biden responded that he is calling for more money for mental health providers but \u201cthat\u2019s not the same as getting rid of or defunding all the police\u201d and that more money for community policing must be provided, too. Barkan asks: \u201cSo we agree that we can redirect some of the funding?\u201d Biden then answers, \u201cAbsolutely, yes.\u201d Biden then gave the caveat that he meant \u201cnot just redirect\u201d federal money potentially but \u201ccondition\u201d it on police improvements. \u201cIf they don\u2019t eliminate chokeholds, they don\u2019t get [federal] grants, if they don\u2019t do the following, they don\u2019t get any [federal] help,\u201d Biden replied, noting federal aid is only a supplement to departments financed mainly by localities and states. On health care Kayleigh McEnany, White House press secretary: \u201cI can tell you that this president stands by Americans with pre-existing conditions.\u201d The facts: No, people with pre-existing medical problems have health-insurance protections because of Obama\u2019s signature health-care law, which Trump is trying to dismantle. One of Trump\u2019s alternatives to Obama\u2019s law \u2014 short-term health insurance, already in place \u2014 doesn\u2019t have to cover pre-existing conditions. Another alternative is association health plans, which are oriented to small businesses and sole proprietors and do cover pre-existing conditions. Neither of the alternatives appears to have made much difference in the market. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s administration is pressing the Supreme Court for a full repeal of the Obama-era law, including provisions that protect people with pre-existing conditions from health insurance discrimination. See:Despite pandemic, Trump administration urges Supreme Court to end Affordable Care Act With \u201cObamacare\u201d still in place, pre-existing conditions continue to be covered by regular individual health insurance plans. Before the Affordable Care Act, any insurer could deny coverage \u2014 or charge more \u2014 to anyone with a pre-existing condition who was seeking to buy an individual policy. On Charlottesville Jack Brewer, former NFL player: \u201cAre you going to allow the media to lie to you by falsely claiming that he said there are very fine white supremacists in Charlottesville? He didn\u2019t say that. It\u2019s a lie.\u201d The facts: Trump said precisely this at a news conference: Racial protests in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017 had \u201cvery fine people on both sides.\u201d One side was made up of a loosely connected mix of white nationalists, neo-Nazis and other far-right extremists. Key Words (Aug. 17, 2017):McConnell says there are \u2018no good neo-Nazis\u2019 after Trump\u2019s \u2018very fine people\u2019 comment Key Words (Aug. 21, 2017):Paul Ryan: Trump \u2018messed up\u2019 his Charlottesville response Trump\u2019s comment conveyed sympathy for racists by declining to single out and call out the violence they perpetuated and by suggesting the episode was merely a contest of legitimate grievances. The violence broke out after those protesters assembled to demonstrate against the city\u2019s decision to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. Pressed at the Aug. 15, 2017, news conference, Trump acknowledged there were \u201csome very bad people\u201d looking for trouble in the group protesting plans to remove the statue. \u201cBut you also had people that were very fine people on both sides,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou had people in that group, excuse me, excuse me, I saw the same pictures as you did. You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down of, to them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park, from Robert E. Lee to another name.\u201d Later in the news conference, he tried to clarify that \u201cI\u2019m not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists \u2014 because they should be condemned totally.\u201d But he went on to assert that the conspicuously racist rally \u2014 partly organized by white nationalist Richard Spencer and with former Ku Klux Klan head David Duke as a scheduled speaker \u2014 had many other people who weren\u2019t white supremacists, and there are \u201ctwo sides to a story ... two sides to the country.\u201d On veterans Pence: \u201cWe reformed the VA, and Veterans Choice is now available for every veteran in America.\u201d The facts: Veterans Choice is far from available to every veteran. It\u2019s true that Trump expanded the Obama-era program, which allows veterans to see a private doctor for primary or mental-health care if their VA wait is 20 days (28 for specialty care) or their VA facility is 30 minutes or more away by car. But in March, the VA halted much of the program due to the coronavirus outbreak and restricted veterans\u2019 access to private doctors, citing the added risks of infection and limited capacity at private hospitals. Under the temporary guidelines, the VA reviewed referrals for nonemergency care \u201con a case-by-case basis for immediate clinical need and with regard to the safety of the veteran when being seen in-person, regardless of wait time or drive time eligibility,\u201d according to the VA. The move drew criticism from several veterans\u2019 groups and conservatives as rendering the program ineffective. \u201c Minnesota\u2019s sawmills lost 25 jobs under Obama, compared with 69 jobs lost during the first three years of the Trump administration. Paper mills did let go of 1,368 workers during Obama\u2019s eight-year presidency, while 674 jobs have been shed under Trump. Nationwide, sawmill jobs improved under Obama and have declined during Trump\u2019s first three years. \u201d On industrial jobs Scott Dane, representing Minnesota loggers and truckers: \u201cBut the last time Joe Biden was in the White House, Minnesota lost over half of its mills, thousands of jobs, and experienced nearly a decade of decline.\u201d The facts: The decline in Minnesota\u2019s sawmills and paper manufacturing has continued under Trump. And nationwide, sawmill jobs improved under Obama and slumped during Trump\u2019s first three years. Minnesota lost 20% of its paper mills during Obama\u2019s presidency, according to the Quarterly Census of Wages and Employment. It lost 18% of its sawmills. That\u2019s a far cry from the \u201cover half\u201d claimed by Dane. The state\u2019s sawmill sector lost 25 jobs under Obama, compared with 69 jobs lost during the first three years of the Trump administration. Paper mills did let go of 1,368 workers during Obama\u2019s presidency, while 674 jobs were shed during the Trump era. But nationwide, the Obama era saw 7,221 new jobs in the sawmill sector. There were 69 sawmill jobs lost under Trump before the pandemic. Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter."}]}
