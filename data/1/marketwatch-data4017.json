So far, the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investment has been made with no strings attached,\u00c2 not even a guarantee\u00c2 that any vaccines and treatments will be affordable to the people who need them.\u00c2 In June, White House leaders announced \u00e2\u0080\u009cOperation Warp Speed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which gives away even more tax dollars and technical support to companies developing\u00c2 five experimental COVID-19 vaccines\u00c2 to be fast-tracked through testing and then mass-produced soon after.\u00c2 The announcement came with a lot of speculation about what\u00c2 the companies will charge, but, again, with no assurance that the vaccine needed to beat COVID-19 will be affordable.\u00c2 \u00c2 While the Trump administration is rushing the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s return to normal and\u00c2 coronavirus cases are surging\u00c2 in more than half of the states, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been little action in Congress on the one thing that actually could get things back to normal: ensuring an affordable COVID-19 vaccine that could curtail the spread of the disease. The first step is obviously the investment we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already seeing to create the vaccine, but the second step is just as important: regulation and accountability to ensure that medicines we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re paying to develop are accessible to all. With so many lives at stake, Americans need to have full confidence that decision-makers at the highest levels of government are acting in the interest of their health and well-being. But instead, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing business as usual from an administration stacked with\u00c2 former pharma executives and a leader of the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s COVID-19 task force who says it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2 counterproductive to set price limits\u00c2 on vaccines.\u00c2 Despite decades of evidence that drug companies\u00c2 price-gouge\u00c2 patients to maximize profits, the Trump administration plans to hand them monopoly control over the price of a COVID-19 vaccine. This is a case study on who really benefits when the U.S. government hands over exclusive licensing deals with no stipulations for pricing. The industry gets richer while Americans are forced to tighten their budgets, ration medicine or go without drugs they depend on. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been the reality of giving corporations control over prices. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a myth that high prices reflect the hard work involved in the research and development of new drugs. Time and again we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen drug companies jack up the cost of insulin, cancer treatments, opioids, and HIV/AIDS treatments \u00e2\u0080\u0094 all drugs developed with significant taxpayer investments \u00e2\u0080\u0094 making drug prices are the biggest driver in\u00c2 health care costs in the U.S.\u00c2 and making the drug industry the\u00c2 most profitable\u00c2 in the nation.\u00c2 Now this cycle is repeating in the development of a COVID-19 vaccine. Beating COVID-19 is a big job, but the administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s refusal to guarantee affordable medicines to all citizens declares defeat before we even try. Leaving equitable access to lifesaving medicines up to the corporations violates common sense and basic responsibility. Congress has to step in and stop the pharmaceutical industry from using another public health crisis to line their pockets and\u00c2 increase their stock prices.\u00c2 Congress must act now to ensure that COVID-19 vaccines and treatments are available to all. It can start with the\u00c2 MMAPPP Act (Make Medications Affordable by Preventing Pandemic Pricegouging), which would put a check on Big Pharma\u00e2\u0080\u0099s monopoly control over prices by requiring drugs developed using taxpayer dollars be made affordable. Congress can also support the TRACK Act, which would require transparency around how taxpayer money is being spent on COVID-19 drug development and clarify what the government has requested in exchange for this investment.\u00c2 There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a long road ahead before COVID-19 recedes from our everyday lives. That timeline will be longer if vaccines are not affordable. To end the crisis, Congress must rein in monopoly control of drug prices \u00e2\u0080\u0094 once and, quite literally, for all.
