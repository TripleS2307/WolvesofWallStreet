Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Investors will be able to make wagers on the price of water later this year with the launch of futures contracts, which are expected to better balance supply and demand for the commodity and hedge price risks. \u201cThe water sector had long wished for some market structure for price discovery and the ability to hedge risk,\u201d says Deane Dray , a managing director and multi-industry analyst at RBC Capital Markets. \u201cIf this new futures contract shows promise, it could spawn more innovation in the futures market related to water.\u201d CME Group CME, -0.87% and Nasdaq NDAQ, +0.36% announced a plan on Sept. 17 to launch the Nasdaq Veles California Water Index futures contract, which will have a settlement price based on its namesake index, late in the fourth quarter of this year, pending a regulatory review. The contract will allow investors to hedge price risks in the spot water market and better manage price swings, says Tim McCourt, CME Group\u2019s global head of equity products and alternative investments. The index, itself, sets a weekly spot rate price of water rights in California, the majority of which are owned and managed by water districts that deliver water to individual farms, says Clay Landry , managing director at consulting firm WestWater Research, which provides the data used to calculate the index. Some farms own water rights directly, he says; other water-rights owners include municipalities, industrial companies, water utilities, and tribes. On Sept. 23, the Nasdaq Veles California Water Index set the weekly spot price of water rights at $510.99 per one acre-foot. The unit of measure represents the amount of water required to submerge one acre of land in one foot of water\u2014equivalent to about 325,851 gallons of water. Each futures contract based on the index will represent 10 acre-feet of water. The index is \u201creflective of arm\u2019s-length economic efforts to determine fair value\u201d for water, says Patrick Wolf, lead product developer with Nasdaq Global Information Services. The focus on the California market offers both relevance and robustness in the depth and breadth of participants and the value of transactions, he says. Wolf points out that the index is up markedly this year following an extremely dry winter in California, with February 2020 marking the driest February for the state in at least 100 years. For commodities, \u201csupply conditions are extremely variable year to year, and the relative scarcity of water is what determines price,\u201d Wolf says. Future price risk is a key feature of the California water market, and this index \u201ccaptures and distills that risk in real time.\u201d Whether the index is \u201csubstantially up or down, it is adding tremendous value to the marketplace.\u201d Year to date, the index value has doubled, boasting a return of more than 100%. The water futures contract will be specific to prices in California, a state that the CME\u2019s McCourt refers to as having among the \u201cmost active and dynamic water markets\u201d in the U.S. California saw more than $1.1 billion in water-market activity last year, he says, and having a \u201crobust, transparent futures market can help more efficiently align supply and demand of this vital resource,\u201d which may, in turn, help consumers. RBC\u2019s Dray, meanwhile, points out that \u201cwhat California is paying for water has little relevance for other parts of the country.\u201d He also expresses skepticism about the new contract, saying water futures would be a niche \u201cunlikely to generate enough open interest,\u201d or volume of contracts, \u201cto support a reliable forward-pricing model.\u201d Still, Dray said he and his team will examine this new security more closely, \u201cto see what the potential might be.\u201d"}]}
