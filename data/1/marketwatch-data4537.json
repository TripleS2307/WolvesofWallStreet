The real-estate industry has come to a slow decision that took years in the making to stop using the word \u00e2\u0080\u009cmaster.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The decision came as other industries re-evaluated their use of language in a racial context. GitHub, a Microsoft-owned company MSFT, +2.48% \u00c2 that hosts a platform for software development, announced in July that it would no longer use the terms \u00e2\u0080\u009cmaster\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cslave\u00e2\u0080\u009d to describe versions of projects. In the photography world, Canon CAJFF, -3.40% \u00c2 also said it would eliminate the terms \u00e2\u0080\u009cmaster\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cslave\u00e2\u0080\u009d to describe modes on cameras and other devices. But the movement to abandon the \u00e2\u0080\u009cmaster bedroom\u00e2\u0080\u009d is not a new one. Behind the scenes, some major players in the real-estate industry have been skipping the term for years now. Home builders, in particular, have stopped using the terminology. PulteGroup PHM, +0.02% \u00c2 has been using the phrase \u00e2\u0080\u009cowner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suite\u00e2\u0080\u009d instead for several years. Lennar Corp. LEN, +0.07% \u00c2 recently chose to standardize \u00e2\u0080\u009cowner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suite\u00e2\u0080\u009d across its markets. Internally, the National Association of Home Builders has altered its survey language to use the phrase \u00e2\u0080\u009cprimary bedroom,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a spokeswoman told MarketWatch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have been hearing that members are making the change to use other descriptions such as primary bedroom or primary suite,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. But it took weeks of nationwide protests sparked by the police killings of Black people in police custody and by the police across the U.S. for the Houston Association of Realtors to announce in late June that it would no longer use the word \u00e2\u0080\u009cmaster\u00e2\u0080\u009d to describe the largest bedroom and bathroom in a home because some of its members viewed the term as racist. Instead, the Realtor group is opting to use the word \u00e2\u0080\u009cprimary\u00e2\u0080\u009d on the multiple listing service platform that real-estate agents use to search for available properties. In Chicago, local brokerage @properties also informed its employees that same month that it would stop using the term \u00e2\u0080\u009cmaster\u00e2\u0080\u009d to describe bedrooms and bathrooms on its website and in marketing materials. The brokerage\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agents, who are independent contractors, aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t banned from using the word, the company noted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is one small change we can make that seems easy and obvious. What is most important is not the origin of the term \u00e2\u0080\u0098master bedroom,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 but rather the fact that it is offensive to some on the basis of race and sex,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the company said.Many have soured on the \u00e2\u0080\u0098master\u00e2\u0080\u0099 bedroom \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not always because of race To many, the phrase \u00e2\u0080\u009cmaster bedroom\u00e2\u0080\u009d is associated with slavery and evokes imagery of violence against people of color. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a repetitive reminder of slavery and plantations,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Donnell Williams, president of the National Association of Real Estate Brokers, said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proper, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad someone brought it up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The origins of the phrase do not appear to come from the era of slavery. In fact, the term was first used in 1925, according to Merriam-Webster. Real-estate brokerage Trelora meanwhile cites the earliest known reference to a master bedroom as appearing in a 1926 Sears SHLDQ, -3.08% \u00c2 advertisement for a pre-fabricated home. Back in 1995, under the Clinton administration, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ruled that use of the term \u00e2\u0080\u009cmaster bedroom\u00e2\u0080\u009d was not considered discriminatory under the Fair Housing Act. And some people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s objections to the phrase don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stem from concerns about its racial implications. One definition of the word master is a male head of household, according to Merriam-Webster. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBased on the discussion that took place, more members viewed the terms as sexist than racist, although some did view them as racist,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Houston Association of Realtors noted in discussion of the name change. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOthers didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t personally view them as sexist or racist but believed we should change the terms for anyone else who might find them objectionable. The consensus was that Primary describes the rooms equally as well as Master while avoiding any possible misperceptions.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBroad support for a new term has yet to materialize A survey of 300 real-estate agents conducted by HomeLight found that roughly 26% supported replacing the word master, and only 8% of agents reported having buyers or sellers expressing discomfort with the term. Multiple factors will make the shift away from the \u00e2\u0080\u009cmaster\u00e2\u0080\u009d bedroom and bathroom difficult. For starters, most multiple listing services nationwide still use that term. These platforms store data about different properties and are used to generate information about homes listed for sale. There is not one national MLS, though \u00e2\u0080\u0094 there are over 800 of them nationwide, according to the National Association of Realtors. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have to think about the MLS service in any market, because they have to standardize the terminology,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jeff Cohn, president and CEO of Cohn Marketing, a Denver-based marketing agency that works with real-estate brokerages among other clients. \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098This needs to be looked at from a national perspective from an organization like National Association of Realtors.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Jeff Cohn, president and CEO of Cohn Marketing Individual brokerages will find it difficult to adopt new terminology if the MLS in their area is still using the old term. Some argue that for broader change to occur it will take the involvement of major national industry leaders. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis needs to be looked at from a national perspective from an organization like National Association of Realtors,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cohn said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf they decide, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where we want to go as an industry,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see real change because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not going to be haphazard.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cohn also said major influencers, particularly the home improvement and design channel HGTV, will play a role in this cultural reset. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you start seeing them using the new terminology, I think many others would follow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. The National Association of Realtors \u00e2\u0080\u009chas no objection to the use of other terminology if consensus evolves that the word has taken on new meaning,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president Vince Malta said in an emailed statement. Jane Latman, president of HGTV DISCA, -2.32% \u00c2 , told MarketWatch in an email that the network continues to have discussions around the language it uses. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRetrofitting hundreds of hours of shows that are already shot and delivered is not always feasible, but we will be more thoughtful moving forward and have brought up this issue to our production partners,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Latman said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are committed to future change and want to use words that are more descriptive and inclusive \u00e2\u0080\u0094 like primary or main bedroom instead of master bedroom.\u00e2\u0080\u009dOthers argue that the real-estate industry has more pressing issues to consider As discussion about the phrase \u00e2\u0080\u009cmaster bedroom\u00e2\u0080\u009d continues, some insist that the real-estate industry has more important changes it could tackle in the name of social justice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe truth of the matter is there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opportunity for improvement far beyond marketing terminology in the industry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Drew Uher, CEO of HomeLight. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are much larger issues that still need to be addressed \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from the ramifications of redlining and steering, wealth inequality, access to down payment funds, and diversity in the industry across agents, brokerages, and Realtor boards \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that would drive lasting change and move us towards equality.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The homeownership rate among Black Americans has always lagged that of white Americans, and last year it fell to the lowest level in decades. And in the current context of the coronavirus pandemic, Black and Hispanic Americans are disproportionately struggling to afford their monthly housing payments. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere needs to be an African American homeownership program,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Williams said, pointing to the Section 184 Indian Home Loan Guarantee Program designed to boost homeownership among Native Americans as a blueprint."}]}
