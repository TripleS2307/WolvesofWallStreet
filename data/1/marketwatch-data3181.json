Trump\u2019s tweets came hours after a man identified as a supporter of a right-wing group was shot and killed in Portland when a large caravan of Trump\u2019s supporters and Black Lives Matter protesters clashed in the city\u2019s streets. Trump praised the caravan participants as \u201cGREAT PATRIOTS!\u201d and blamed the city\u2019s Democratic mayor for the death. Trump has throughout the summer cast American cities as under siege by violence and lawlessness, despite the fact that most of the protests demonstrating against racial injustice have been largely peaceful. With about nine weeks until Election Day, some of his advisers see an aggressive \u201claw and order\u201d message as the best way for the president to turn voters against his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, and regain the support of suburban voters, particularly women, who have abandoned him. But Democrats accuse Trump of rooting for unrest and trying to stoke further violence for political gain instead of ratcheting down tensions. Biden in a statement said he \u201cunequivocally\u201d condemned violence on all sides, while accusing Trump of \u201crecklessly encouraging\u201d it. \u201cHe may think that war in our streets is good for his reelection chances, but that is not presidential leadership \u2014 or even basic human compassion,\u201d Biden said. \u201cDo you seriously wonder, Mr. President, why this is the first time in decades that America has seen this level of violence?\u201d asked Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler. \u201cIt\u2019s you who have created the hate and the division.\u201d The White House pushed back. \u201cThe only people to blame for the violence and riots in our streets are liberal politicians and their incompetent policies that have failed to get control of these destructive situations,\u201d White House spokesman Judd Deere said. Trump prepared to travel this week to Kenosha, Wisconsin, where tensions are still raw after police shot Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, in the back seven times, leaving him paralyzed. The shooting has ignited new demonstrations against racial injustice and police brutality months after George Floyd\u2019s death at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer touched off a wider reckoning on race. Rep. Karen Bass, a California Democrat who leads the Congressional Black Caucus, said Trump is \u201cdoing everything he can to fan the flames.\u201d \u201cI think his visit has one purpose, and one purpose only. And that is to agitate things and to make things worse,\u201d Bass said Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cIt is clear his campaign is all about law and order. It is a throwback to the past. And he\u2019s going to do everything to disrupt law and order in this time period.\u201d Trump has cast the upcoming election as clash between \u201claw and order\u201d and anarchy, and he has denounced protesters as \u201cthugs\u201d while sharply defending police. That theme was front-and-center at last week\u2019s Republican National Convention, which used recent protest footage to paint a foreboding and violent picture of the future if Biden denies Trump a second term. While the protests this year have largely been peaceful, many businesses have been vandalized and buildings burned. That destruction will be highlighted Tuesday when Trump travels to Kenosha, where he will be meeting with law enforcement officers and \u201csurveying\u201d the damage, Deere said. Asked if Trump planned to meet with Blake\u2019s family, Judd said the president\u2019s schedule had yet to be finalized, but Blake\u2019s attorney, Benjamin Crump, told CBS News the family \u201chas not been contacted\u201d by Trump \u201cat this time.\u201d News of the visit drew swift condemnation from local Democratic leaders, including Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes. \u201cI don\u2019t know how, given any of the previous statements that the president made, that he intends to come here to be helpful. And we absolutely don\u2019t need that right now,\u201d Barnes said in an interview with CNN. Former NAACP President Cornell William Brooks told the network that Trump would be \u201cturning Air Force One into a gasoline truck\u201d and \u201cbringing gas to a fire.\u201d \u201cThe president is going to make a bad situation worse,\u201d Brooks said. Trump has had little to say about the Blake shooting, which was captured on cellphone video. \u201cWell, I\u2019m looking into it very strongly. I\u2019ll be getting reports,\u201d he said in an interview Friday with a local New Hampshire television station. \u201cIt was not a good sight. I didn\u2019t like the sight of it, certainly, and I think most people would agree with that.\u201d Trump offered a similar response Saturday when asked about Kyle Rittenhouse, the white 17-year-old who has been charged with fatally shooting two protesters and wounding a third Tuesday after he traveled to Kenosha, apparently to defend the city from protesters. Attorneys representing Rittenhouse, who was seen walking with an AR-15, have said he acted in self-defense. Trump told reporters Saturday the case is \u201cunder investigation right now\u201d and that \u201cwe\u2019re looking at it very, very carefully.\u201d But Trump on Sunday appeared to lend support to the teenager when he liked a retweet of a series of messages that began, \u201cKyle Rittenhouse is a good example of why I decided to vote for Trump.\u201d The circumstances of Saturday night\u2019s shooting in Portland remain unclear.Video from the city shows sporadic fighting, as well as Trump supporters firing paintball pellets at opponents and using bear spray as counterprotesters threw things at the Trump caravan. The victim is a member of Patriot Prayer, a right-wing group whose members have frequently clashed with protesters in Portland in the past, its founder, Joey Gibson, said Sunday. White House officials, meanwhile, continued to blame local leaders for allowing the protests to continue. \u201cWe\u2019ve had over 200 anarchists and they\u2019re not peaceful protesters. These are people that every night commit violent acts,\u201d Trump\u2019s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that \u201cif the governor had taken action early on after Day One, Day Two of some of that violent activity occurring there, we probably \u2014 a lot of this could have been avoided. Unfortunately, he acted a little too late.\u201d Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin urged calm, while also laying blame. \u201cWhen you encourage the disdain for the police, you encourage criminals. When you do little or nothing to stop rioting, you encourage anarchy. So when you are encouraging criminals and anarchy, people\u2019s lives are lost,\u201d Johnson said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d"}]}
