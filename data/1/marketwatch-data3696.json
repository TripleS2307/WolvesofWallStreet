Two other senior executives will also leave the company. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Rio Tinto RIO, +1.28% \u00c2 detonated in May an ancient habitat at Juukan Gorge with traces of 46,000 years of life. It did so legally, but against the fierce opposition of traditional Aboriginal owners. The blast gave the company access to $135 million worth of high-grade iron ore. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 The original reaction of the board, which found in an earlier review that no individual mistake had been committed and only recommended to cut the short-term bonuses of a few executives, had created an uproar among activist shareholders, Aboriginal people and environment organizations. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 The French-born Jacques, who became chief executive in 2016, will remain until a successor is found, but no later than the end of March 2021. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Rio Tinto shares were up 1.8% in midday trading, against a stable London market as measured by the FTSE 100 UKX, +0.64% \u00c2 index. The outlook: Jacques\u00e2\u0080\u0099s departure illustrates the rising power of activist investors or pension funds demanding that companies comply with cultural, social and environmental standards, and start looking beyond their strict bottom line. The big mining groups, often operating in every region of the world on land owned by Indigenous people, are a natural target for such activism. The delayed response of Rio Tinto may however mean that the board\u00e2\u0080\u0099s problems with demanding shareholders are far from over."}]}
