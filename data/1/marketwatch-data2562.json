I guarantee on Nov. 4, it\u2019ll open up.\u201d The president claimed Democratic governors \u201clove shut down until after the election is over, because they want to make our numbers look as bad as possible for the economy.\u201d Trump and his fellow Republicans have been expected to aggressively counterattack the Democrats and their presidential nominee at this week\u2019s GOP convention, a four-day affair that aims to make the case it is Trump and not Biden who can revive the pandemic-battered U.S. economy. Trump on Monday described North Carolina as a state \u201cthat\u2019s been very good to me.\u201d \u201cWe won a lot of victories here,\u201d the Republican incumbent said. \u201cI do want to show a little bit of a difference, because another state that\u2019s been very good to me is Wisconsin. And Joe Biden was going to have their convention in Milwaukee, and they didn\u2019t go there at all \u2014 they didn\u2019t do this. We did this out of respect for your state.\u201d Wisconsin was picked to host last week\u2019s Democratic National Convention, but Biden and other top Democrats chose not to travel to Milwaukee, as their convention became a largely virtual event due to ongoing public health concerns amid the coronavirus pandemic. Trump\u2019s comments came after Republicans at their scaled-down convention formally nominated him for a second term in the White House, and as more than 300 delegates cast their roll-call votes for him. The president earlier this month hadn\u2019t been expected to travel to Charlotte, but reports over the weekend said he and Vice President Mike Pence would appear in person on Monday. In his remarks on Monday, Trump also continued his long-running attacks on efforts to increase the use of mail-in ballots during the COVID-19 pandemic. \u201cWho\u2019s mailing them? Mostly Democrat states and Democrat governors. Supposing they don\u2019t mail them to Republican neighborhoods?\u201d the president said. \u201cThis is the greatest scam in the history of politics.\u201d He also said: \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing is using COVID to steal an election.\u201d Read more:Trump suddenly supports mail-in voting \u2014 for the key swing state of Florida And see:Trump claims mail voting leads to fraud, but he and other top White House officials have embraced it In addition, Trump talked up the recent performance of U.S.equities, saying: \u201cWe\u2019re just about ready to break the all-time stock-market record.\u201d The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% on Monday traded within 5% of its February peak, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39% closed at records on Friday. The president is slated to accept the GOP nomination on Thursday night in a speech given at the White House, but he also was set to be featured during each day of the convention. Among the speakers on the schedule for Monday night are GOP Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina and Nikki Haley, who served as the Trump administration\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, as well as Donald Trump Jr. and Mark and Patricia McCloskey, the St. Louis couple who brandished guns at protesters during a racial-injustice demonstration outside their home. The Biden campaign on Monday offered up counterprogramming, rolling out a \u201cRepublicans for Biden\u201d group featuring former GOP lawmakers such as Arizona\u2019s Jeff Flake and Virginia\u2019s John Warner. \u201cIt is because of my conservatism, and because of my belief in the Constitution, and in the separation of power, and because I am gravely concerned about the conduct and behavior of our current president that I stand here today \u2013 proudly and wholeheartedly \u2014 to endorse Joe Biden as the next president,\u201d said Flake, a former senator and longtime Trump critic."}]}
