In a statement late Thursday, Pandora said it now sees a full-year earnings before interest and tax margin of between 17.5% and 19%, from previous guidance of 16%-19%. \"In the third quarter of 2020, the underlying brand momentum continued to develop strongly as Pandora experienced a further improvement in the majority of the main markets,\" it said. \"In markets where the physical store network is open, a high conversion rate and continued strong performance in the online channel largely offset reduced traffic into physical stores compared to the same quarter last year.\" The company, which sells charm bracelets, rings and earrings at around 7,300 locations world-wide, said online organic sales rose 89% in the third quarter, despite having 90% of its physical stores open during the quarter. By the end of the third quarter, 95% of its stores were open. The stores that remain temporarily closed as well as social distancing and reduced opening hours continue to weigh on performance, but Pandora said it is investing in its brand momentum while preparing for the peak trading periods in the fourth quarter. The company said it now expects organic sales to fall 14% to 17% in 2020 from a fall of between 14% and 20% previously. Pandora is due to announce third-quarter earnings on Nov. 3.
