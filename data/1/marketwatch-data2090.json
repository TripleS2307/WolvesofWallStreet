The commodity tallied a third climb in a row, but the gains have been modest and prices still remain lower for the week. \u201cOil prices need a shot of something,\u201d said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at The Price Futures Group, in a note. The U.S. Federal Reserve \u201cwants it to be another shot of stimulus and perhaps a shot of a coronavirus vaccine,\u201d he said. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s another shot of compliance by the OPEC plus cartel, or maybe it just needs to get past September where hurricanes and storms impacted both supply and demand.\u201d West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery CL.1, -1.62% CLX20, -1.62% edged up by 38 cents, or nearly 1%, to settle at $40.31 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after tapping a low at $39.12. November Brent crude UK:BRNX20 BRN.1, -0.07%, the global benchmark, added 17 cents, or 0.4%, to trade at $41.94 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe. \u201cLifeless crude prices and frightful refining margins present a faltering demand recovery, especially with COVID cases rising again. But fortunately, OPEC\u2019s supply constraint and a further fall in U.S. supply in 4Q and 2021 will provide the offset,\u201d said Stephen Innes, chief global markets strategist at AxiCorp, in a note. Oil rose Wednesday after the Energy Information Administration reported that U.S. crude inventories fell for a second straight week, by 1.6 million barrels for the week ended Sept. 18. That was much less than the average forecast from analysts polled by S&P Global Platts for a decline of 4 million barrels, but the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday had reported an increase of 691,000 barrels. Also, gasoline inventories fell by a larger-than-expected 4 million barrels, while distillate stocks unexpectedly declined by 3.4 million barrels. On Thursday, October gasoline US:RBV20 rose 1.2% to finish at $1.1957 a gallon, while October heating oil US:HOV20 settled at $1.1167 a gallon, up 0.8% Read:Here are two stocks that stand to benefit from California\u2019s electric-vehicle push \u201cThe continued drop in U.S. oil supply and refinery challenges suggests a balancing of supply,\u201d said Flynn. \u201cIt also indicates that we should see oil bottom and rally as we head into winter and out of the [refinery] maintenance season.\u201d Also, \u201cdespite gridlock in Washington, oil demand should recover, and we face a balanced market globally that will add higher prices,\u201d he said, though \u201cthe risk to this forecast is a massive\u201d COVID-related shutdown. Natural-gas futures, meanwhile, notched back-to-back gains on Thursday as the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported Thursday that domestic supplies of natural gas rose by 66 billion cubic feet for the week ended Sept. 18. That was smaller than the increase of 77 billion cubic feet forecast by analysts polled by S&P Global Platts. October natural gas US:NGV20 climbed by 5.8% to settle at $2.248 per million British thermal units. Front-month prices tallied a two-day gain of almost 23%, the largest two-day rise since November 2018, according to Dow Jones Market Data.
