How did stock-market benchmarks perform? The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% DJIA, +0.56% ended with a loss of 807.77 points, or 2.8%, at 28,292.73, after dropping more than 1,000 points at its session low. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% closed 125.78 points lower, down 3.5%, at 3,455.06. The Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39% tumbled 598.34 points, or 5%, to end at 11,458.10. The declines marked the biggest one-day drops for all three indexes since June. The fall came a day after the S&P 500 claimed its 22nd record close of the year, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite arrived at its 43rd such all-time high and the Dow topped the 29,000 level for the first time since February. Thursday\u2019s fall snapped a four-day win streak for the Nasdaq and a 10-day run of gains for the S&P 500\u2019s tech sector. What drove the market? \u201cIn the absence of a specific catalyst, it\u2019s easy to classify today\u2019s swoon as profit-taking,\u201d said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance, noting that the \u201cmost-loved\u201d parts of the market \u2014 the technology, consumer discretionary and communications services sectors \u2014 sold off the most. In One Chart:Tech stocks and the rest of the market are both very expensive -- but for very different reasons Given the scale of the market\u2019s rally before Thursday\u2019s swoon, analysts said it was premature to declare a tech-led correction to be under way, instead arguing that a near-term pullback was overdue and would likely prove healthy. \u201cTech stocks, and the overall market, hadn\u2019t really had a bad day since June, so this is a healthy breather. It was never just going to be a straight line up. But the long-term structural support for technology has not changed and support for equities has not either,\u201d said Esty Dwek, head of global macro strategy for Natixis Investment Managers, in emailed comments. Signs of rotation into sectors left behind by the stock market rally were easy to find. The S&P 500 index tech sector fell 5.8%, while the communications services and consumer discretionary sectors each dropped more than 3%. The energy sector, in contrast, fell just 0.7%, while financials declined 1.6%. Doubts about the prospect of further fiscal stimulus from Congress may be one factor discouraging investors who have been betting on Republicans and Democrats striking a deal later this month to offer additional relief to American consumers and businesses. On Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Democrats and Republicans still have \u201cserious differences,\u201d following a brief phone call with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, reports said. Investors have also been calling for a rotation away from the leading tech stocks to the broader market in the hopes that it would strengthen the stock-market rally\u2019s foundations. \u201cThere is a sort of benign way that this excess can be corrected through a process of rotation,\u201d said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Schwab, in an interview. She said positive economic data could lay the path for a more sustainable rally. Thursday\u2019s round of economic data continued to point to a steady recovery, though the prospects for the labor market were unclear ahead of Friday\u2019s official jobs report. New applications for unemployment benefits in the latest weekly period ending in Aug. 29 fell 130,000 to a seasonally adjusted 881,000 or lower than the consensus estimate of 940,000 but this was after the Labor Department said last week it tweaked its seasonal adjustment method amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The unadjusted or real number of initial jobless claims rose slightly to 833,353 from 825,761, indicating there was barely any change last week in how many people are applying for benefits. In other data, a revised reading of U.S. second-quarter productivity rose 10.1%, while the trade deficit widened to $63.6 billion. The U.S. IHS Markit final purchasing managers index for the service sector for August was 55, up from 54.8 in July, while the Institute of Supply Management\u2019s service sector indicator for August fell to 56.9 in August from 58.1 in July. Any number above 50 indicates an expansion in industrial activity. By most measures, the economy is still considerably weaker now than it was before the pandemic. Millions of Americans remain out of work, Congress is deadlocked over another financial-aid package, and many industries such as travel, tourism and entertainment are just a shell of their former selves.
