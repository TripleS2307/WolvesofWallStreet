In their political giving as individuals, these chief executives have combined to give more to Trump than Biden. Some 15 CEOs whose companies are components of the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% have donated a total of $2.489 million to Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s principal campaign committee, its joint fundraising groups with the Republican National Committee or pro-Trump super PACs. Meanwhile, 30 chief execs have contributed $536,100 to Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main campaign committee, its joint groups with the Democratic National Committee or pro-Biden super PACs. These figures come from a MarketWatch analysis of processed Federal Election Commission data on individual contributions made between January 2019 and August 2020. Anyone who held the CEO job in 2019 or 2020 at a company that was part of the S&P 500 is included.

Some 179 of these CEOs donated a total of $35.61 million of their own money to Republican candidates and organizations, while 148 bosses combined to contribute $3.172 million to Democratic efforts, according to MarketWatch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s analysis of outlays between January 2019 and August 2020. Most of the GOP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s big advantage comes from Las Vegas Sands\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Adelson, who has given $26.38 million to Republicans, including $25 million to the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC aiming to protect and expand on the GOP majority in the U.S. Senate. But even with Adelson excluded, Republicans come out ahead in drawing donations from the S&P CEOs, with $9.233 million in 2019 and 2020, tripling the Democratic haul. Related: Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 chances of Senate takeover rise, and that could affect health care, energy and financial services And see:If the Democrats win the Senate, Big Tech better be ready for a bigger fight Many of the S&P CEOs \u00e2\u0080\u0094 81 of them, to be exact \u00e2\u0080\u0094 contributed to both Republican and Democratic groups. In other words, only 98 of the 179 GOP donors gave just to the GOP, and only 67 of the Democratic donors gave just to that party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s groups. The greater giving to Republicans by the S&P CEOs in the current election cycle fits with their past behavior. Ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, a MarketWatch analysis found 200 S&P chief execs had given a total of $7.4 million to the GOP, while 149 donated a total of $2.6 million to Democrats. MarketWatch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s analysis here doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cover political contributions by current or former executives of privately held companies, such as billionaire Michael Bloomberg, as it focuses instead on chief executives of the S&P 500\u00e2\u0080\u0099s large, publicly traded companies.
