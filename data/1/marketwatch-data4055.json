SHW, +1.47% said Monday that it was raising its second-quarter sales outlook, to a decline in the mid-single-digit percentage range from a year ago. The paint seller had previously expected a decline in the low to mid-teens percentage range. The current FactSet consensus for second-quarter revenue of $4.33 billion implies an 11.2% decline. The company also raised the sales outlook for its Americas Group and Consumer Brands Group business segments, as moving to curbside pickup and the e-commerce business helped stem the COVID-19 pandemic's effect on business, but maintained its outlook for the Performance Coatings Group. The company said its automotive refinish business remains under pressure, and recovery is sluggish in its general industrial and industrial wood businesses. The stock, which inched up 0.1% in premnarket trading, has rallied 41.7% over the past three months, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% has gained 34.4%."}]}
