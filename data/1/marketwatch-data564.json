Trump, who was admitted to the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center late Friday, has been given a dose of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experimental neutralizing antibody cocktail, in addition to Gilead Sciences Inc.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remdesivir. \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs the president undergoes treatment for his emerging symptoms, the public must receive daily, honest updates about the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s condition, not from White House staff but from his medical team.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Dr. Ashish Jha, Dean, Brown University School of Public Health Dr. Sean Conley, Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s physician, said Sunday that Trump is being treated with dexamethasone, a steroid that is primarily used to treat severely ill, hospitalized COVID-19 patients. During a roughly 10-minute news conference, Conley said that the president had received his first dose of dexamethasone on Saturday. Dexamethasone is a type of cortisteroid that researchers in the U.K. said in June can reduce deaths in severely ill COVID-19 patients who were on ventilators or oxygen support. The drug has yet to show any benefit in hospitalized patients not on respiratory support. Conley also confirmed for the first time that Trump was briefly on supplemental oxygen Friday morning, noting that at that time he had a high fever and \u00e2\u0080\u009chis oxygen saturation was transiently dipping below 94%.\u00e2\u0080\u009d For more, see:Physicians prescribe steroid used to treat severely ill COVID-19 patients to Trump Trump himself addressed the nation in a video statement from the hospital on Saturday, in which he said he was feeling better but that the next few days would be the real test.

He also said it is crucial that immediate and widespread testing be carried out of all who attended events with Trump over the last week to avoid further transmission of the virus. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe public also needs to know how testing and tracing are being implemented and in what time frame, and if all relevant parties are quarantining,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn light of the upcoming election and a nation deeply polarized and increasingly losing trust in government, honest updates about the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s condition and actions taken to control further spread and keep key leaders safe, will assure a basic level of trust in the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to respond effectively at this critical moment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFailing to be transparent will further erode the social contract. We need transparency at every level,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote. See now:Weekend reads: What to know now that President Trump has the coronavirus On Friday, many lawmakers voiced hope that Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s positive diagnosis would change Americans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 view of the crisis and improve compliance with safety measures. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told MSNBC she hoped the news would bring a complete shift in the U.S. approach to managing the pandemic. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaybe now that people that see that the president of the United States, and all the protection he has, and the first lady, having this exposure, it might be a learning experience\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd more than learning, it has to be something that is acted upon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pelosi criticized Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attitude to the illness as cavalier. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGoing into crowds unmasked and all the rest was a sort of brazen invitation for something like this to happen\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sad that it did, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nonetheless hopeful that it will be a saner transition to what this virus all about.\u00e2\u0080\u009d iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat who was in the audience for Tuesday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidential debate, echoed that sentiment: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a reminder that all of us are vulnerable to this dangerous virus and should follow public health guidelines about mask wearing, social distancing, and more,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Coons said in a statement, CNN reported. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, said she hoped the news would serve as a wake-up call to every single American. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the good news. We can beat this enemy \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to take every single one of us working together to do it. Right now the most effective weapon we have is pretty simple: it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wearing a mask that covers your nose and mouth. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s washing your hands with soap and water. And maintaining six feet of physical distance from one another.\u00e2\u0080\u009d See: President Trump tested positive for coronavirus \u00e2\u0080\u0094 here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s everything we know so far Read also:Trump tests positive for coronavirus, and the implications are wide-ranging World leaders rushed to wish the president and first lady speedy recoveries, while markets initially tumbled as pundits weighed in on what this means for the election and the management of the pandemic. Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, which Trump has attacked for its handling of the pandemic, sent his best wishes to the president and his wife. See now:As Trump says he is positive for coronavirus, a look back at his shifting statements on face masks and the threat of COVID-19 The U.S. counted another at least 1,728 new cases on Saturday and at least five new deaths, according to a New York Times tracker. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s after 53,428 new infections and at least 863 deaths on Friday. (Weekend counts are typically lower due to reduced staffing at medical centers.), In the past week, the daily count has averaged 1,230 cases a day, up from the average two weeks earlier. The U.S. has lost 209,401 people to the virus, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University, or about a fifth of the global toll of 1.03 million. Experts have for months lamented the U.S.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s failure to adopt the testing, contact tracing and isolation that have allowed some countries to contain the spread, and to persuade the public of the need to fully comply with the recommended safety measures. Trump confided to journalist Bob Woodward that he has publicly downplayed the virus. Trump has insisted it would disappear, touted unproven and even harmful treatments, and derided Biden for wearing a face mask. That in turn has created mistrust among his supporters and led to protests against face masks in many states. Coronavirus cases have climbed in 33 states and Puerto Rico since August, according to a Washington Post analysis. Now hospitalizations are on the rise again in at least a dozen states, including New Jersey, Delaware and Texas. Wisconsin has seen record high cases counts for 20 straight days as of Thursday, and added more than 17,000 cases in a single week, the analysis found. In other news: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Former White House adviser Kellyanne Conway has tested positive for coronavirus, after attending last weekend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Rose Garden event. Conway disclosed the news in a tweet, in which she said her symptoms were mild and that she felt fine. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have begin a quarantine process in consultation with physicians,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she wrote. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie also tweeted that he has tested positive. The two joint a number of people close to Trump to test positive, joining the president and first lady Melania Trump, adviser Hope Hicks, campaign manager Bill Stepien, RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, Utah Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican, Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, also Republican, and University of Notre Dame President, the Rev. John Jenkins. Conway stepped down from her role as adviser in August, saying she wanted to devote more time to her family. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Solomon Islands reported its first case of COVID-19, after remaining free of the illness throughout the global pandemic, the Guardian reported. Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare confirmed the news in a nationally televised address that a Solomon Islands student repatriated from the Philippines late last month has tested positive for Covid-19. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt pains me to say we have lost our Covid-19 free status, despite our collective efforts to prevent the pandemic from entering our country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. The student is in quarantine and contact tracing and testing of medical staff taking care of students is in effect, he said. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 New York state officials have launched Covid Alert NY, an app that will warn New Yorkers if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve spent more than 10 minutes within 6 feet of other app users, creating a network of \u00e2\u0080\u009cclose contacts\u00e2\u0080\u009d who can easily be notified of exposure if one of them later tests positive for the virus. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a technology-based contact tracing app,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTesting is only as good as your contact tracing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cuomo made the announcement in partnership with New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy. New York and New Jersey will now join Pennsylvania and Delaware in a regional app network that will work across state lines to help stop the spread. Connecticut is expected to join the network in the coming weeks. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Australia has announced plans for a limited travel bubble with New Zealand, the BBC reported. New Zealanders will be allowed to travel to the Australian regions of New South Wales and the Northern Territory without requiring quarantine. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is the first stage in what we hope to see as a trans-Tasman bubble between the two countries, not just that state and that territory,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Australian Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack. New Zealanders will still have to quarantine on the way back, and for now Australians are not being granted access to New Zealand. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Amazon.com Inc. said than 19,000 of its workers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 out of the 1.37 million it employs worldwide \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have tested positive for COVID-19 or are presumed to have had the virus, MarketWatch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Jon Swartz reported. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have been conservative in this analysis. First, we cast a wide net by including both confirmed and presumptive cases in the Amazon figures,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the e-commerce giant said in blog post disclosing a data analysis. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSecond, actual COVID-19 rates in the general population are greater than the official counts because not everyone in the general public gets screened for symptoms or tested.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Amazon employees are regularly screened for symptoms and are increasingly being tested at work, regardless of whether they are showing symptoms, to identify asymptomatic cases, according to the company.Latest tallies There are now 34.9 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, the Johns Hopkins data show, and at least 24 million people have recovered. The U.S. leads the world as measured by cases and deaths. Brazil has the second-highest death toll after the U.S. at 145,987, but third-highest case tally at 4.9 million. India is second to the U.S. by case tally at 6.5 million, and has the third-highest death toll at 101,782. Mexico is fourth with 78,880 deaths and ninth with 757,953 cases. The U.K. has 42,407 deaths and 482,658 cases, the highest death toll in Europe and fifth-highest in the world. China, where the illness was first reported late last year, has had 90,609 cases and 4,739 fatalities, according to its official numbers. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the latest medical news? Promising new clinical data for an experimental COVID-19 treatment hints at a secondary but possibly more important takeaway for investors: that, if this neutralizing antibody treatment works in coronavirus patients, so will the vaccines that are in development, as MarketWatch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Jaimy Lee reported. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. REGN, +0.36% \u00c2 on Tuesday shared preliminary data from a Phase 1/2/3 clinical trial for REGN-COV2, finding that the investigational therapy reduced viral load and made symptoms go away sooner in some nonhospitalized patients with mild or moderate cases of COVID-19. It was most effective in patients with higher viral loads who had not tested positive for antibodies. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe believe our data will have positive implications for the likelihood of success of vaccines that target the same spike protein that REGN-COV2 targets,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Regeneron CEO Leonard Schleifer told investors on Tuesday, according to a FactSet transcript of the call. See now:There are seven coronavirus vaccine candidates being tested in the U.S. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where they stand Moderna Inc.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s MRNA, +0.09% \u00c2 potential coronavirus vaccine will not be ready by the U.S. presidential election, the biotech company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief executive told the Financial Times, as MarketWatch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Mike Murphy reported. CEO St\u00c3\u00a9phane Bancel told the FT in an interview that Moderna \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a front-runner in the COVID-19 vaccine race \u00e2\u0080\u0094 will not seek emergency-use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration until Nov. 25 at the earliest and does not expect to have secured approval for distribution of the vaccine to the general public until spring 2021. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think a late [first quarter], early [second quarter] approval is a reasonable timeline, based on what we know from our vaccine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bancel told the FT. Pfizer Inc. PFE, -0.27% \u00c2 CEO Albert Bourla told employees that development of its COVID-19 vaccine would move \u00e2\u0080\u009cat the speed of science\u00e2\u0080\u009d rather than due to political pressure, the Associated Press reported. The AP cited an internal letter. Pfizer and BioNTech BNTX, +1.23% \u00c2 have an experimental coronavirus vaccine that is currently in Phase 3 trials. There are three other vaccine candidates in late-stage trials in the U.S., and Trump has repeatedly said that a vaccine may be ready by November, referring at least twice to Election Day, Nov. 3, as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cspecial date\u00e2\u0080\u009d by which time a vaccine could be available. LabCorp. LH, +0.77% has been granted an emergency-use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for a new type of molecular test for COVID-19. The new test uses heat and technology to extract RNA from samples collected for COVID-19 testing and can improve the efficiency of testing, the company said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe innovative heat extraction process, which has comparable sensitivity to current extraction methods, traps viral particles, eliminating the need for RNA extraction reagents to capture and concentrate viral nucleic acid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the statement. An emergency-use authorization is not a full FDA approval. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the economy saying? The U.S. created 661,000 new jobs in September and the unemployment rate fell again to 7.9% to the lowest level of the pandemic, but the gain in hiring was the smallest since the economy reopened and pointed to deceleration in the recovery, MarketWatch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Jeffry Bartash reported. The increase in employment last month fell short of Wall Street\u00e2\u0080\u0099s estimate. Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast a recapturing in September of some 800,000 lost jobs. Private-sector hiring was somewhat stronger, with 877,000 new jobs created, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday. What dragged down employment in September was a decline in public-educations jobs at local schools and state colleges. Most have adopted forms of online learning. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, fell for the fifth month in row to 7.9% from 8.4%, a new pandemic low. The official jobless rate had peaked at 14.7% in April before its ongoing decline. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis underscores that job gains from here on will be tougher, and speaks to the need for more stimulus to help the economy and to support the more than 11 million Americans who had jobs in February and who are unemployed now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. See also: Frontline workers in eye of pandemic storm for months, now fending off repo man Separately, Americans grew more optimistic toward the end of September as consumer sentiment reached a six-month high, reflecting more confidence in the U.S. economy after a summer lull. The final consumer-sentiment survey in September climbed to 80.4 from a preliminary reading of 78.9, the University of Michigan said Friday. It was also up from August\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 74.1 score. The index now sits at the highest level since the pandemic erupted in March, mirroring the results of other household surveys. Earlier this week the Conference Board said its consumer-confidence index shot up to a pandemic-period high.What are companies saying? \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Activision Blizzard Inc. ATVI, +0.52% \u00c2 is delaying the release of its \u00e2\u0080\u009cWorld of Warcraft: Shadowlands\u00e2\u0080\u009d installments to continue beta testing the game. The company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Blizzard division had expected to release the update to the massive multiplayer online role-playing game at the end of October but is opting to release it \u00e2\u0080\u009clater this year.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cBlizzard is extending the beta test and iterating based on great input from players, focusing on endgame-related tuning and polishing efforts that have been partially slowed due to the team working from home during the ongoing pandemic,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the company said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 General Motors Co.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s GM, -0.15% third-quarter total automobile sales fell 10%, but the company said there were \u00e2\u0080\u009csigns of recovery\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the auto industry and highlighted its September sales. GM delivered 665,192 vehicles in the quarter, a 10% drop compared with the year-ago period, but sales improved each month within the three-month span during the pandemic. The industry and GM sales \u00e2\u0080\u009crebounded significantly in September, finishing the month with year-over-year sales increases,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the company said. Retail sales also were a reason for optimism and GM said its pickup trucks and SUVs \u00e2\u0080\u009care selling extremely fast.\u00e2\u0080\u009d GM \u00e2\u0080\u009cremains focused on producing the right mix of vehicles to meet demand.
