What happened: New orders increased for the second straight month. Activity has been helped by acceleration in the pace of new business growth at services providers, IHS Markit said. The rate of backlog accumulation slowed. Firms were able to raise their selling prices at the fastest pace since Oct, 2018. Big picture: Business activity has improved from the steep decline in activity in the second quarter during the depths of the pandemic. Manufacturers continue to outperform service providers.
