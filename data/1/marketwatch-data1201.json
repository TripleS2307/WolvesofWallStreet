Caputo has often publicly pushed back on CDC statements about the coronavirus and said falsely in a Facebook video on Sunday that the CDC has a \u201cresistance unit\u201d to undermine Trump, according to the New York Times. His page has since been made private. According to a report in Politico, Caputo, along with scientific adviser Paul Alexander, pressured officials to alter the CDC\u2019s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports, a long-running weekly journal that features the latest science-based research and data on infectious diseases. Known as MMWR, the report has long been a sacred government information resource for doctors, scientists and researchers tracking outbreaks. The officials pressured CDC to change the reports, at times retroactively, to better align them with Trump\u2019s often rosier public statements about the coronavirus, Politico reported.

The panel is also demanding documents from the department, including communications sent or received by Redfield, Azar, Caputo and Alexander regarding the MMWR and other matters. HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter. On the other side of the Capitol, Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington state, called for Azar to fire Caputo immediately, while Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called on Azar himself to step down, citing the Trump administration\u2019s chaotic response to the public health emergency. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } According to Politico, Caputo and Alexander complained about a report that explained children can transmit the coronavirus and Alexander asked the CDC to alter it or pull it down, saying the report could impact school reopening and hurt Trump politically. In the Facebook Live video, reported by The New York Times, Caputo warned that left-wing hit squads would engage in armed insurrection after the election and said officials were engaging in \u201csedition\u201d as they handled the pandemic. \u201cYou understand that they\u2019re going to have to kill me, and unfortunately, I think that\u2019s where this is going,\u201d Caputo said, according to the Times. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Caputo is a longtime confidant and fierce defender of Trump who worked on his presidential campaign.
