Tesla TSLA, +1.89% stock hit an all-time high of $1,650.71 on Friday, and has nearly quadrupled in price this year. Earlier this week, the company announced a five-for-one stock split to make the shares more accessible to investors and employees. BofA and Morgan Stanley highlighted the share rally and future share catalysts such as the company\u2019s \u201cbattery day\u201d next month.

Yet Chief Executive Elon Musk\u2019s \u201cleadership, a compelling brand, and improved execution are driving an ever- increasing stock price,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is direct evidence that the company has unfettered access to low-cost capital, which remains a key advantage that may (and should) be leveraged to accelerate growth to almost 50% per annum over the next five years,\u201d the analyst said.

Of 35 analysts polled by FactSet focusing on Tesla, a third rate the stock a sell, and half rate it a hold, with the remaining 20% rating it a buy. The average price target is $1,232, representing 25% downside from Friday\u2019s share price. \u201dWhile we remain skeptical that (Tesla) will be the dominant EV automaker in the long-run, if a big global footprint can be built with no-cost capital, the \u2018growth\u2019 story would carry the day for the stock,\u201d Murphy said. Adam Jonas at Morgan Stanley raised his rating to the equivalent of hold from sell, and raised his price target to $1,360. The analyst and his team downgraded Tesla stock to their equivalent of sell, from neutral, in June, citing trade risks between the U.S. and China, concerns about near-term demand, and the company\u2019s ongoing capital needs. \u201cWith this report, we now feel we can justify transferring some value of the third-party battery business from the realm of the bull case into our base case,\u201d Jonas said in a note Friday, explaining that the bank now values Tesla as a battery and powertrain supplier in addition to its main business of making cars. The idea that Tesla could supply \u201cnot only drive trains and software but superior battery packs to the auto industry is increasingly gaining validation.\u201d Tesla has set a \u201cbattery day\u201d for Sept. 22 to showcase its battery technology. The shares have gained 293% this year, compared with gains around 4% for the S&P 500 index. SPX, +0.87%"}]}
