The statement came hours after Democratic leaders issued a new warning that Congress appears to be the target of a foreign interference campaign. Biden said in a statement that he would treat foreign interference as \"an adversarial act that significantly affects the relationship between the United States and the interfering nation's government.\" He criticized President Donald Trump for not doing enough in response to U.S. intelligence agencies' assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election. \"If any foreign power recklessly chooses to interfere in our democracy, I will not hesitate to respond as president to impose substantial and lasting costs,\" Biden said. The new alarms give a renewed urgency to concerns that foreign actors could be trying to influence the vote or sow disinformation. Biden said last week that he had begun receiving intelligence briefings and warned that Russia, China and other adversaries were attempting to undermine the presidential election. \"We know from before, and I guarantee you I know now because now I get briefings again. The Russians are still engaged, trying to de-legitimize our electoral process. Fact,\" Biden said Friday, not revealing details or evidence. \"China and others are engaged as well in activities designed for us to lose confidence in the outcome.\" During an online fundraiser Monday night, Biden added: \"It's going to be tough, there's not much I can do about it now except talk about it, and expose it, but it is a serious concern. It is truly a violation of our sovereignty.\" And in an interview on MSNBC, Biden said Russian President Vladimir Putin \"knows I mean what I say.\" The Democratic leaders said in a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray on Monday that they are concerned that Congress appears to be the target of a \"concerted foreign interference campaign\" to influence the 2020 presidential election. They asked Wray for an all-members, classified briefing on the matter of election interference before the August recess. The letter from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and the top Democrats on the House and Senate intelligence committees contains no details about the threats, though they describe them as serious and specific. \"We are gravely concerned, in particular, that Congress appears to be the target of a concerted foreign interference campaign, which seeks to launder and amplify disinformation in order to influence congressional activity, public debate, and the presidential election in November,\" wrote Pelosi, Schumer, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence panel. A congressional official familiar with the letter said that there was a classified addendum \"to ensure a clear and unambiguous record of the counterintelligence threats of concern.\" The person, who was granted anonymity to describe the confidential letter, said the addendum largely draws from the executive branch's own reporting and analysis. The FBI said it had received the letter but declined to provide further comment. While the Democrats' exact concerns were unclear, there have been worries since Trump was elected that Russia's efforts to sow American chaos are ongoing in the 2020 election. The 2016 effort included hacking of Democratic email accounts during the campaign by Russian military intelligence officials and the subsequent disclosure by WikiLeaks. Intelligence authorities said that hack-and-leak operation was aimed at helping Trump's presidential campaign and harming that of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. Russians also used a covert social media campaign to spread misinformation and posts aimed at dividing American public opinion. In the end, former special counsel Robert Mueller charged 25 Russian nationals for their roles in foreign interference and influence during the campaign. Democrats, including members of the Senate intelligence panel, have voiced concerns that an ongoing Republican probe into Biden's son, Hunter Biden, and his work in Ukraine would amplify Russian disinformation. That probe is being led by Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis. Frank Figliuzzi, former FBI assistant director for counterintelligence, suggested in a tweet that a subtext of the Democrats' request is that they believe Russia to be supplying the GOP with Biden disinformation. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } In a statement, Johnson spokesman Austin Altenburg said the committee's staff had already requested and received a briefing on Russian disinformation and Johnson had requested an additional briefing at the member level. While Biden criticized Trump for not acting aggressively against Russia, his pledge that his intelligence community would report \"publicly and in a timely manner\" on any foreign efforts to interfere in an American election also appeared to be a course correction of sorts to the approach of the Obama administration, which waited months after Russian hacks of Democratic email accounts in 2016 to officially attribute them to Moscow. Officials did so only after a rigorous internal debate over what they should say. Even when the administration did issue its October 2016 statement blaming Russia for the hacks, it did not mention Putin by name nor an ongoing effort to determine whether the Kremlin's election interference efforts were being coordinated with the Trump campaign. Democrats were reported to be wary of risking an appearance of politicizing intelligence in a way that could be perceived as assisting the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton. An effort to put out a bipartisan statement on the matter was reportedly blocked by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who a year ago blocked consideration in the Republican-led chamber of a House-passed bill to bolster election security, calling it unnecessary. More recently, Senate Republicans were reported to have stripped from the National Defense Authorization Act, as a condition of the legislation's passage, a provision requiring presidential campaigns to report any attempts by foreign entities to involve themselves in a U.S. election. Clinton, who would go on to lose the 2016 presidential election to Trump, said Monday she was \"glad\" Biden was speaking up. \"It's very clear that Russia succeeded,\" she told MSNBC. \"They believed that they were able to influence the minds and even the votes of Americans, so why would they stop?\" MarketWatch and other news services contributed."}]}
