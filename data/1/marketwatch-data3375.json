Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images BERLIN (Project Syndicate) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 With November approaching, I am becoming ever more nervous about the U.S. presidential election. While my American friends focus on Joe Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lead over President Donald Trump in opinion polls, believing deeply in U.S. democracy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capacity for self-renewal, my own perspective as a British citizen and think-tank director has me worried. As a Briton, I can remember watching a 20-point polling lead for \u00e2\u0080\u009cRemain\u00e2\u0080\u009d become a victory for \u00e2\u0080\u009cLeave\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the Brexit referendum four years ago. And as a think-tank director, I work closely with scholars who study how authoritarian leaders manipulate democratic systems to stay in power, as has happened in Turkey, Russia, Hungary and Poland. \u201c Like other authoritarian leaders, Trump is deploying a new antidemocratic politics that has yet to be fully comprehended. \u201d In fact, it often seems as though Trump has studied the tactics pioneered by other aspiring strongmen more closely than anyone. Based on recent conversations with experts on each of these countries, I have compiled the following catalog of dirty tricks that Trump seems to borrowing.Weaponization of history The first is the weaponization of history. Populist leaders promote their political platforms through polarization and social division. They do not mind alienating and insulting some voters if doing so will energize their own base. By posturing as the champions of national greatness, they want to determine who counts as authentic citizens \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and who does not. This practice inevitably brings history to the fore. Whether it is Russian President Vladimir Putin invoking the Soviet victory in World War II, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u009fan harking back to the Ottoman Empire, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00c3\u00a1n fixating on the Treaty of Trianon or British Prime Minister Boris Johnson looking back to\u00c2 Pax Britannica, each leader has advanced a highly partisan historical narrative.Post-truth politics Another, related approach is what might be called post-truth politics. These leaders prefer direct communication with voters through professional propaganda videos and social media, because this allows them to dismiss the inconvenient facts offered by experts. In this media ecosystem, fact checking gains little purchase, because the people who need to hear it are not listening, or refuse to believe anything the \u00e2\u0080\u009cliberal\u00e2\u0080\u009d media says. In many democracies, fake news is now most common at the\u00c2 local level, where political operatives have filled the vacuum left by the decline of traditional city and regional outlets.Run against the \u00e2\u0080\u0098deep state\u00e2\u0080\u0099 A third tactic is to run against one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own government. The term \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeep state\u00e2\u0080\u009d is said to have originated in Turkey in the 1990s, but now features prominently in the lexicons of Trump, Orb\u00c3\u00a1n, Erdo\u00c4\u009fan, Johnson and Poland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2 de facto\u00c2 ruler, Jaros\u00c5\u0082aw Kaczy\u00c5\u0084ski. By blaming nameless shadowy, faceless characters behind the curtain and undefined cabals, all these leaders have a ready excuse for all of their own failures. \u201c It often seems as though Trump has studied the tactics pioneered by other aspiring strongmen more closely than anyone. \u201d A fourth element in the playbook is voter suppression. Like Erdo\u00c4\u009fan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s constant attempts to disempower Kurdish voters, Trump and the Republican Party are desperate to disenfranchise African-Americans. For an incumbent would-be strongman, the need to tip the electoral scales opens the door to all kinds of attacks on democratic processes. Hence, before Poland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s general election in May, the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party tried to limit all voting to mail-in ballots, effectively transferring control of the election from the independent National Electoral Commission to the PiS-controlled postal service. Though this plan ultimately ran into resistance, it showed that there are countless ways for authoritarians to meddle in or subvert the voting process. Not surprisingly, mail-in voting and the politicization of the U.S. Postal Service have become major issues in the U.S.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s upcoming election, too.Dirty tricks Another related device is \u00e2\u0080\u009cpolitical technology,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a term for the dirty tricks commonly\u00c2 associated\u00c2 with post-Soviet politics. Such methods include Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2 covert backing\u00c2 of third-party candidates like Jill Stein in the 2016 U.S. presidential election;\u00c2 kompromat, or compromising material (epitomized by the search for dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden, and his surviving son, in Ukraine); and simply declaring victory before the votes are counted. In the case of the United States, if Trump declares victory before all postal mail-in ballots have arrived, Republican-controlled legislatures in key states could end the counting early to lock in that outcome. An incumbent authoritarian can also engage in various forms of \u00e2\u0080\u009clawfare,\u00e2\u0080\u009d using law enforcement or compliant courts to facilitate gerrymandering, voter suppression, coverups and other violations of the democratic process. Here, one of the biggest advantages is the ability to control the timing of events or the release of politically damaging information. Many people still believe that then\u00e2\u0080\u0093FBI Director James Comey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s announcement of a new probe into Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use of email just days before the 2016 election tipped the outcome in Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s favor. Now, the Department of Justice is run by Attorney General William Barr, a man who has shown no compunction about politicizing independent law-enforcement agencies on Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behalf.Law and order Another common authoritarian tactic is to play the \u00e2\u0080\u009claw and order\u00e2\u0080\u009d card. By tarring the Black Lives Matter protests as an outpouring of violent \u00e2\u0080\u009curban\u00e2\u0080\u009d hooliganism, Trump is reprising the racial politics used by former Republican presidents since Richard Nixon, but by Erdo\u00c4\u009fan more recently, during the Gezi Park protests in 2013. The problem for the Democrats in the U.S., and democrats everywhere, is that all these techniques tend to become more effective the more they are called out. Fact checking fake news can inadvertently spread misinformation more widely. Warnings about voter suppression can become self-fulfilling prophecies if enough people conclude that the process is rigged and not worth participating in. Challenging violations through the courts creates the impression of an end run around democracy. To avoid these effects, the project of corrupting democracy needs to be clearly identified, named and analyzed through a new lens. There is a world of difference between the political subterfuge outlined above and the outright falsification of election results, as happened last month in\u00c2 in Belarus. Nicu Popescu, a former Moldovan foreign minister who is now at the European Council on Foreign Relations, contends that autocracy is not the right term to describe the phenomenon. Rather, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is the \u00e2\u0080\u009cdegradation, corrosion and deconsolidation of democracy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In any case, if Trump were Moldova\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president, one assumes that the European Union would be calling him out for his dirty tricks. Any such criticism from abroad in his case would almost certainly be counterproductive. But it may help to put the current American experience in a wider context, so that democratic forces can see Trump more clearly. Ultimately, the only way to defeat Trump is through politics. The task for the Democrats is to remind Americans what democracy is for \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and, one hopes, to counter Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tactics effectively.
