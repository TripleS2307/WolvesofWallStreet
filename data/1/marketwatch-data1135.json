An announcement Tuesday that the Department of Defense would pay $71 million to fund manufacturing of a device used to administer the Inovio INO, -1.36% \u00c2 vaccine sent the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stock soaring, to close at a record $21.57. Inovio is expected to release Phase 1 data in the next week. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe pandemic response is different,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Joseph Kim, CEO of Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc., which has said it plans to have a millions of doses of its vaccine candidate by the end of this year. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing all these things in parallel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Read:Why virus stocks are driving market volatility In many ways, the COVID-19 pandemic has upended the traditional drug development process, and now health officials and drugmakers are trying to hasten the time it takes to find a working vaccine, in part by moving forward with manufacturing plans even before the vaccine candidates prove their safety or efficacy. Making this kind of change is what enables government officials like Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, to say repeatedly that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible to have a viable COVID-19 vaccine within a year of the coronavirus first coming to the attention of the U.S. government. Trump administration officials have said they aim to have a vaccine by January as part of Operation Warp Speed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlthough you can never guarantee at all the safety and efficacy of a vaccine until you actually test it in the field, we feel cautiously optimistic based on the concerted effort and the fact that we are taking financial risks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Fauci testified during a Committee on Energy and Commerce hearing on Tuesday, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot risks to safety, not risk to the integrity of the science, but financial risks to be able to be ahead of the game.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A COVID-19 vaccine would change the trajectory of the pandemic, which has sickened more than nine million people and killed nearly 500,000, allowing economies to fully reopen and people to return to work and school. This may be why government officials have said again and again that a year-long timeline to develop a working vaccine is possible. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to have it very soon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d President Donald Trump said Wednesday at a news conference. But even PhRMA, the pharmaceutical industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest lobbying group, says vaccine development takes 10 years, and the chief executives of Novartis NVS, +0.97% and Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +1.39% \u00c2 have said developing a COVID-19 vaccine will take longer than 12 months. At the same time, several companies developing COVID-19 vaccines have pledged millions and sometimes billions of doses of vaccines that have yet to prove their efficacy. This type of guarantee has worried some in the medical community. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the timeline that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been promised,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bunny Ellerin, director of the health care and pharmaceutical management program at Columbia Business School. \u00e2\u0080\u009cExpectations have been set with the public now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are immense public and political pressures to develop a new vaccine, a process that typically takes years, not months,\u00e2\u0080\u009d three medical experts at NYU Langone Health wrote in an op-ed in JAMA last month. \u00e2\u0080\u009cProceeding stepwise through the phases of clinical trials is the ethical standard for investigations involving human research participants.\u00e2\u0080\u009d See also: Hope dims for hydroxychloroquine even as medical study detailing the drug\u00e2\u0080\u0099s failure is retracted Yet some officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that by building out manufacturing capacity before clinical trials have concluded may mean that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible to more quickly secure and dispense a working vaccine, as well as supply larger clinical trials that will need to have thousands of participants down the line. According to the World Health Organization, there are 16 vaccine candidates in clinical trials across the globe, four of which are being tested in the U.S. Those are Moderna Inc.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s MRNA, +0.09% \u00c2 mRNA-1273, Inovio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2 INO-4800, Novavax Inc.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s NVAX, +0.18% NVX\u00e2\u0080\u0091CoV2373, and BioNTech BNTX, +1.23% \u00c2 and Pfizer Inc.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s PFE, -0.27% \u00c2 BNT162. At least half a dozen other companies including Johnson & Johnson, ImmunityBio Inc. and NantKwest Inc. NK, +5.81%, and Sanofi SNY, +0.89% \u00c2 plan to test their investigational vaccines in the U.S. if the candidates move past the preclinical stage. A lot of the development activity is being done in parallel, with clinical trial phases overlapping with manufacturing plans, according to Clement Lewin, the head of Sanofi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) office. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA vaccine is going to be required to get back to normal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt makes sense to invest at risk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Some relatively unknown companies that help manufacture pharmaceutical products have emerged as pandemic stock darlings. Emergent BioSolutions Inc. EBS, -0.81%, which has said it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doing vaccine manufacturing work for AstraZeneca AZN, +0.63%, J&J, Novavax, and Vaxart Inc. VXRT, +0.97%, has seen shares jump 36% this year. It has also already signed a $628 million agreement with U.S. health officials to produce COVID-19 vaccine candidates through 2021. Shares of Lonza Group LONN, +0.75%, Moderna\u00e2\u0080\u0099s manufacturing partner for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, have soared 43% year-to-date. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople, companies are starting to plan to make doses even before, you know, the vaccine works,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Fauci said Tuesday during the House hearing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo the risk of the speed is not risk to safety. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not risk to scientific integrity. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s risk to money.\u00e2\u0080\u009d See also: What we do know \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know \u00e2\u0080\u0094 about the coronavirus at day 100 of the pandemic Still, all of this doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t guarantee that these vaccines will work. The race to develop any vaccine is an uphill battle: it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s notoriously difficult (\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe safety bar is much higher\u00e2\u0080\u009d for vaccines because they are administered to healthy people, said Mizuho Securities biotech analyst Difei Yang), has traditionally taken years, and once-promising candidates can fail to be safe or efficacious in clinical trials. It took researchers a year and a half to develop a Zika vaccine, four years for a mumps vaccine, more than five years for an Ebola vaccine, and 10 years for a flu vaccine. Vaccines for HIV, herpes and hepatitis C have failed, some in Phase 3 trials. And, in some cases, experimental vaccines for SARS and dengue fever have triggered an enhanced version of the disease in people who have been vaccinated. That said, Bernstein analysts are bullish on the probability that this virus will be amenable to a vaccine. Their rationale? This coronavirus hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mutated much, convalescent serum indicates that some patients develop immunity, and we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen significant spikes of re-infections. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re optimistic in the eventual development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, we would not expect the initial crop of vaccines to be silver bullets that solve the pandemic,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they wrote in a June 5 note to investors."}]}
