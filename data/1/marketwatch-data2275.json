Diller, the chairman of both Expedia EXPE, +0.36% and IAC IAC, +0.79%, warned that the uncertainty swirling around the election will only serve as another headwind for a market many believe has already gotten stretched. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEach day from now until November is going to get more and more concerning, and more and more decisive, and more and more difficult,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Diller, who has backed Joe Biden to the tune of more than $600,000,\u00c2 according to Federal Election Commission data cited by CNBC. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI actually think if I could wake up in mid-November, maybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even late November given what might be contested, I would rub that magic genie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, explaining that there could be an initial, but temporary, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdowndraft\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the stock market if Biden wins. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs far as business is concerned, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think long term there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be any particular difference\u00e2\u0080\u009d between Biden and Trump as president, he added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think there will be differences personally. I think people are going to pay higher taxes, particularly the wealthy. I think there are going to be things that are going to be done, really done, to deal with inequality.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2 Watch this clip from the wide-ranging interview: .wsj-interactive.generic-iframe-embed[name=\"diller\"] { height: 349px; margin-bottom: 5px; } .at16units .bleed .wsj-interactive.generic-iframe-embed[name=\"diller\"] { height: 349px; } body.at12units .bleed .wsj-interactive.generic-iframe-embed[name=\"diller\"] { height: 349px; } body .inline .wsj-interactive.generic-iframe-embed[name=\"diller\"], body .offset .wsj-interactive.generic-iframe-embed[name=\"diller\"], body .header .wsj-interactive.generic-iframe-embed[name=\"diller\"], body.at8units .bleed .wsj-interactive.generic-iframe-embed[name=\"diller\"] { height: 349px; } body.at4units .inline .wsj-interactive.generic-iframe-embed[name=\"diller\"], body.at4units .offset .wsj-interactive.generic-iframe-embed[name=\"diller\"], body.at4units .header .wsj-interactive.generic-iframe-embed[name=\"diller\"] { height: 349px; } Cash wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the best place to be during Tuesday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trading session, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% up triple digits.
