National gas prices are likely to average near $2.25 a gallon for the third quarter of this year, representing a 15% decline from the $2.66 average seen last summer, AAA said in its report, which is based on economic forecasting and research by IHS Markit. \u201cThis will be the cheapest summer for filling-up since 2016,\u201d AAA said. AAA forecasts that Americans will take 707 million trips for the July 1 to Sept. 30 summer period, down 14.6% from the same period a year ago. Out of that total number, 683 million Americans will take a trip by automobile, down 3.3% from the same period a year earlier. The \u201crail, cruise and other\u201d category will suffer an 85.5% drop to just 9.3 million this summer, while trips by air are expected to be down by nearly 74% to 15.1 million. Car trips account for about 97% of the favored mode of transportation and will see the smallest decrease in travel volume, AAA said. Americans this summer are taking a \u201c\u2018wait and see approach\u2019 when it comes to booking and are likely to book more long weekend getaways than extended vacations,\u201d said Paula Twidale, AAA\u2019s senior vice president of travel, in a statement. \u201cWhen they do venture out, the greatest share of travelers \u2014 683 million \u2014 will take to the road to satisfy their wanderlust.\u201d Without the pandemic, AAA would\u2019ve projected 857 million trips during the third quarter, which would\u2019ve represented a 3.6% increase over last year, so it estimates that the pandemic wiped out nearly 150 million summer trips. AAA did not release Memorial Day or Independence Day travel forecasts, citing the pandemic\u2019s impacts on travel. In mid-May, a survey of more than 1,800 people from fuel-price tracker and travel app GasBuddy revealed that 31% of Americans said that they plan to go on a summer road trip.
