TikTok argues that it has \"taken extraordinary measures to protect the privacy and security of TikTok's U.S. user data\" by storing U.S. user data outside of China and \"erecting software barriers that help ensure that TikTok stores its U.S. user data separately from the user data of other ByteDance products,\" according to a blog post. The company also says in its blog post, which quotes elements of the complaint, that the Trump Administration's executive order on TikTok \"violates the due process protections of the Fifth Amendment\" by giving the company \"no notice or opportunity to be heard (whether before or after the fact).\" Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +2.48% has expressed interest in potentially purchasing TikTok's U.S. operations, which would help stave off the ban, while Oracle Corp. ORCL, +0.42% and Twitter Inc. TWTR, -0.23% are reportedly interested as well."}]}
