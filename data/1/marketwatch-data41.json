Can the couple manage to score a nine-digit payday? hey bought the parcel back in the late 1990s, and have lived there for almost two decades. They\u2019re now reportedly spending most of their time on Kauai\u2019s North Shore in Hawaii, and are ready to let their Thai-inspired home go to a buyer who can manage the hefty asking price. Brosnan\u2019s abode has a Thai flavor So what does $100 million buy you? Let\u2019s take a tour of the estate. The couple apparently fell for Thai architecture while the actor was filming there, for the 1997 James Bond film \u201cTomorrow Never Dies.\u201d The beachfront retreat took about 10 years to complete, Architectural Digest notes.

Homes in Malibu \u2014 especially on the ocean \u2014 don\u2019t come cheap. When we looked at $100-million-plus sales in the area a couple of years ago, an agent told us there was \u201cnot enough product at the super-high end.\u201d Two years later, far more properties are available in this exclusive enclave of beachfront properties favored by billionaires and celebrities. The Brosnan offering isn\u2019t even the most expensive listing on the market in Malibu. That would be this one, listed for $125 million. Another property, on the market for $115 million, topped our list of the week\u2019s most expensive homes back in February. The $100 million threshold has been broken before for posh properties in this neighborhood. An oceanfront estate that was on the market for $150 million sold for $100 million in August last year. Two years ago, a prestigious property owned by the co-founder of the Hard Rock Caf\u00e9, Peter Morton, sold for $110 million, a record-breaking amount for L.A. County at the time. Is the price right? So is the $100 million price tag on solid ground? We asked some agents for their take. Turns out, $100 million isn\u2019t quite as eye-popping of a price as it used to be. George Penner, CEO of Deasy Penner Podley, notes: \u201c$100 million is certainly a significant number. But [a home on] over an acre on Broad Beach \u2014 with unique architecture \u2014 doesn\u2019t hit the market every day.\u201d \u201cThe property is truly a trophy estate in every way. They\u2019re taking advantage of current market conditions that favor the ultra-luxury \u2018shelter in place\u2019 market,\u201d says Cara Ameer, a bicoastal agent with Coldwell Banker licensed in California and Florida. \u201cAspirational pricing is a common strategy when it comes to putting a property on the market of this caliber,\u201d Ameer adds. \u201cIt attracts attention and interest\u2014but this strategy only works if you have a truly exceptional and one-of-a-kind property to back it up. In this case, we have a definite winner.\u201d The desirable oceanfront locale and spacious parcel also contribute to the asking price. \u201cIt\u2019s an exceptional property, with more than one acre of prime land with ocean frontage, which is quite rare,\u201d says Shirley Sherman with Douglas Elliman. Sherman adds, \u201cIn today\u2019s market, this is what the discerning high-end buyers are looking for. In my opinion, the $100 million price tag in Broad Beach is completely justified.\u201d Now, the goal will be to find a buyer with the bankroll who agrees. Chris Cortazzo of Compass holds the listing. This story was originally published on Realtor.com"}]}
