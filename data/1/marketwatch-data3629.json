The FT said Mayer made the decision to step down after President Donald Trump ordered the popular app to be banned in the U.S. unless parent company ByteDance Inc. of Beijing sold it within 90 days. In a letter to employees, Mayer said the current political climate had changed, and the role he had signed up for \"will look very different\" as a result of the Trump administration's action, the FT reported. Mayer joined TikTok in May, after a stint in charge of Walt Disney Co.'s DIS, +1.53% streaming service, Disney+. TikTok General Manager Vanessa Pappas will take over as interim CEO, the FT reported."}]}
