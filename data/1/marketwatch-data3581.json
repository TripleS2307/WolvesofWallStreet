The final results of the consumer-sentiment survey in June slipped to 78.1 from an initial 78.9, the University of Michigan said Friday. What happened: Consumers don\u2019t think the economy can get much worse, but they are unsure how long it will take for the U.S. to return to normal.

The South was the first region to reopen. Consumer sentiment barely rose in the South in June, whereas it soared in the Northeast \u201cwith residents apparently expecting the later and more gradual reopening to produce at worst a negligible increase in infections,\u201d said Richard Curtin, the chief economist of the sentiment survey. Consumers also expressed more pessimism over Washington\u2019s ability to help. Confidence in Washington\u2019s economic policies fell to the lowest level since President Trump took office in January 2017. See:Marketwatch\u2019s Coronavirus Economic Recovery Tracker. Big picture: The cautious optimism about an economy recovery last month could soon give way to more unease if a new explosion in coronavirus cases is not brought under control. The disease is spreading more rapidly in the South and parts of the West even as it slows in the harder hit Northeast. Most economists predict a choppy recovery and uneven growth as the nation searches for ways to allow businesses, schools and other entities to safely reopen. Unemployment is likely to remain high for at least the next year.

Stocks have zig-zagged over the past few weeks as the economy reopened but suffered another increase in coronavirus cases."}]}
