But that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean now is a good time to refinance for everyone. Last week, Freddie Mac FMCC, +0.52% \u00c2 reported that mortgage rates hit a new record low for the fourth time this year, with the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropping to 3.13%. When rates hit their first record low of the year back in March, it triggered a deluge of refinancing activity just as many lenders were transitioning to remote work environments because of the spread of COVID-19. That led to a massive backlog at some lenders, with some borrowers waiting weeks to close their refinances. Now, the market has settled down, and lenders have adapted to the coronavirus world. And the good news for borrowers is that most markets are served by mobile notary services, said Pat Stone, co-founder and chairman of title insurance company Williston Financial Group, and other states allow for entirely virtual mortgage processes. That means in most parts of the country getting a new home loan won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean risking your health, as infection rates remain stubbornly high in many areas.

Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what homeowners need to consider before closing on a new loan.Figure out when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll break even As a general rule of thumb, experts say that a refinance will be worthwhile if it will net a homeowner an interest rate between 50 and 75 basis points lower than their current mortgage\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rate. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because the reduced interest will compensate for the closing costs associated with the refinance. But those savings don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come immediately \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it will take a few year before the savings via monthly payments accrue to outweigh the costs. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in your forever home, it might make sense to refinance with a half-point rate decrease,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Holden Lewis, home and mortgage expert at personal-finance website NerdWallet. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut if you plan to sell the home within five years or so, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most likely not worth it because you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll pay more in fees than you would save during that time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in your forever home, it might make sense to refinance with a half-point rate decrease.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Holden Lewis, home and mortgage expert at personal-finance website NerdWallet Pay attention to the loan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s term Homeowners shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily default to a 30-year loan, despite their popularity. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause rates have fallen so much you could probably get into a 15-year loan and maybe maintain or even still lower your monthly payment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Tendayi Kapfidze, chief economist at LendingTree TREE, -0.37% \u00c2 . \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to pay off the loan sooner and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to pay less interest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Choosing a shorter term has its trade-offs though, mortgage industry experts warn, if locking into such a loan means making larger monthly payments. The standard 30-year mortgage offers flexibility. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have the flexibility to pay extra every month when you can afford to, and you can cut back to the minimum required payment during insecure times,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lewis said.Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be afraid of closing costs When doing your break-even analysis, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t shy away from paying closing costs. While paying those costs upfront may seem like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s making the refinance more expensive, in reality it could be saving you money. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always attractive to say \u00e2\u0080\u0098no cost,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 but you might end up paying for it over the life of the loan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Brian Koss, executive vice president of Mortgage Network, a Massachusetts-based lender. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because those costs don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go away. Rather, they may be rolled into the loan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s balance, or lead to a higher interest rate. Along those lines, you can prepay your interest by paying for mortgage points. The upfront cost, again, will be higher if you do this, but will save you thousands in interest.The tumultuous economy has made it harder to qualify As millions of Americans lost their jobs or were furloughed because of coronavirus-related business closures, lenders went into damage control mode. Many lenders raised the standards borrowers must meet to qualify for a new loan. This included higher minimum credit scores and lower debt-to-income ratios, among other factors. The prospect of an imminent economic recovery is far from certain. While the job market has improved in recent weeks, some states that have reopened their economies have seen a surge in coronavirus cases. \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always attractive to say \u00e2\u0080\u0098no cost,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 but you might end up paying for it over the life of the loan.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Brian Koss, executive vice president of Mortgage Network \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe V-shaped bounce back was kind of a pipe dream in the first place, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s looking less and less likely, notwithstanding the recent strong data that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kapfidze said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been anticipating that lenders are going to get more and more conservative and restrictive with their lending standards.\u00e2\u0080\u009d If you were furloughed, laid off or if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re self-employed, it could be harder to get approval for a refinance. In these cases, borrowers may have luck turning to their current lender for a refinance. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour current lender is heavily invested in you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kapfidze said. It will cost them money to lose business, so they may be willing to offer homeowners deals on refinancing.If you received forbearance, you may hit roadblocks The CARES Act let millions of Americans take advantage of the ability to claim forbearance from their mortgage payments. But being in a forbearance plan could disqualify a homeowner from certain types of loans. If you skipped payments while in forbearance, you must make at least three current payments after ending the plan to be eligible for a refinance into a loan backed by Fannie Mae FNMA, +0.73% \u00c2 or Freddie Mac. Also see:Americans are eyeing homes in the suburbs as pent-up demand hits housing market But if you were one of the many Americans who requested forbearance but continued making payments, you will be eligible to refinance right away so long as you stay current on your loan.Finally, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try to time the market Yes, mortgage rates have fallen to a new record low multiple times this year. But there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no guarantee that trend will continue. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople are waiting for a rate a half a percent below where we are now relatively \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s getting greedy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Koss said. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a significant upside risk to mortgage rates right now. Their recent drops have largely come after the stock and bond markets have responded to negative news about the coronavirus pandemic. The potential for a second wave remains, and some states are seeing another surge of infections as part of the first wave of the outbreak. But health experts have suggested that a vaccine could come very soon, and researchers have several promising candidates for coronavirus treatments. If a vaccine or treatment for COVID-19 is announced, that would likely cause markets to rally \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and mortgage rates to rise in tandem. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try to time the bottom, just pick the rate that makes the most sense,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Koss said."}]}
