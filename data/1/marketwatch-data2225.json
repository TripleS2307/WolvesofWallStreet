So why aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they? Apple Inc.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AAPL, +1.74% \u00c2 Tim Cook, Amazon.com Inc.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AMZN, +3.01% \u00c2 Jeff Bezos, Facebook Inc.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s FB, +0.26% \u00c2 Mark Zuckerberg and Alphabet Inc.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s GOOGL, +1.82% \u00c2 GOOG, +1.97% \u00c2 Sundar Pichai can think of 5 trillion reasons why: That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the collective market value, in dollars, of their companies. All but Facebook are worth at least $1 trillion. The fab four have never been worth more, as they gobble up market share and expand into other segments through a flurry of acquisitions. As Apple hurtles toward becoming the first company to reach $2 trillion in market value, shares of Amazon and Alphabet catapulted to record highs after Mizuho analyst James Lee raised his price targets for both, citing jumps in cloud spending in the financial services, retail and health-care industries.

This chart might have you rethinking your investment The steep ascent of Big Tech, which is fueling a resurgent stock market despite a deepening pandemic, underscores the enduring power of the industry as consumption of it escalates in a work-from-home economy. This is particularly pronounced among the Mount Rushmore of tech, minus Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +2.48% \u00c2 . Their products and services have become essential for shopping (via Amazon and Google), entertainment (Apple and Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s YouTube), news and how-to tutorials (Google search), and socializing (Facebook). And that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t include sharp spikes in the use of smartphones (Apple and Google) and the cloud (Google, Amazon and Microsoft). \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf anything, the pandemic has furthered Americans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 dependence on technology for groceries, goods, communication, entertainment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rebecca Allensworth, a law professor at Vanderbilt University, told MarketWatch in a phone interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a further opportunity to solidify power of these companies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d How the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee interprets the growing financial power of tech\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Big Four, and how it sways the subcommittee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s calculus, remains a closely guarded secret. A staffer declined comment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSince last June, the subcommittee has been investigating the dominance of a small number of digital platforms and the adequacy of existing antitrust laws and enforcement,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., chairman of the subcommittee, said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGiven the central role these corporations play in the lives of the American people, it is critical that their CEOs are forthcoming.\u00e2\u0080\u009d None of the companies scheduled to testify were willing to talk on the record, but representatives from at least two note a stark contrast between fostering competition and undercutting successful companies that are fueling the U.S. economy and global economic leadership. There is also a sense of Congress shifting blame from its own shortcomings and unpopularity to increasingly powerful tech companies and their influence in a divided society, these people said. A resulting fear among the companies is potential damage to U.S. economic stalwarts at a time when China has made no secret about its plan to dominate the tech industry and industry standards. This much is true: All four have been \u00e2\u0080\u009ccalled into the principal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Allensworth said, and for profoundly different reasons. Facebook is caught in a vortex of bad news as the Federal Trade Commission mulls its No. 2 standing in digital advertising, aided in large part by its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. The spread of coronavirus has accelerated the shift in advertising from billboards, newspapers and radio to digital platforms like Facebook, Google and Amazon. Ironically, antitrust regulators\u00e2\u0080\u0099 scrutiny comes amid a worldwide boycott of Facebook in July by hundreds of brands \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including heavyweights Coca-Cola Co. KO, +0.69% \u00c2 , Verizon Communications Inc. VZ, +0.23% \u00c2 , Starbucks Corp. SBUX, +0.53% \u00c2 , Unilever UL, +1.44% \u00c2 , and SAP SAP, +0.65% \u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in protest of hate speech and misinformation that appears on the social media company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s digital platforms. Read more: Facebook considers banning U.S. political ads ahead of election, report says See also: Here are the major brands that have pulled ads from Facebook Last week, leaders of four of the organizations coordinating the #StopHateForProfit advertising boycott met with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, Chief Product Officer Chris Cox and others. Facebook also faces immense pressure over its hands-off policy regarding political advertising, and is reportedly considering a ban on such ads ahead of the U.S. election in November. If it follows through, it could lose out on hundreds of millions of dollars, according to RBC Capital Markets. Google, which reportedly hopes to avert an EU antitrust investigation into its planned $2.1 billion acquisition of Fitbit Inc. FIT, -0.14% \u00c2 by promising not to use Fitbit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health data to help it target ads, appears to be in the crosshairs of Attorney General William Barr as well. In the coming months, the Justice Department is expected to decide whether to file a lawsuit charging Alphabet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Google with abuse of power in the market for advertising technology and search products. The government is also examining allegations that Google abused its dominance over search, according to published reports. Ultimately, a successful suit conceivably could reshape Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not to mention a large swath of the economy \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and put a throttle to several years of unfettered growth in Silicon Valley. Google hinted in a recent 67-page filing that although it accounts for nearly 30% of spending in the digital ad market worldwide, it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enough to overcharge customers and squeeze competitors. Apple, which is grappling with COVID-19\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impact on its retail operations, could be vulnerable too over accusations of how it wields market power. Late last year, email app developer Blix said it had data showing Apple suppressed App Store rankings of products that compete with Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own apps. In October, Blix sued Apple, alleging patent infringement and antitrust violations. On its website, Apple says its App Store provides \u00e2\u0080\u009cequal opportunities to developers to deliver their apps and services across iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV and Apple Watch.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Amazon competes in a number of defined markets, antitrust experts such as Herbert Hovenkamp at the University of Pennsylvania point out. It is how the company interlinks those markets that has drawn the attention of antitrust investigators. It all makes for an interesting intersection of politics, economic power and cultural ethos when Cook, Bezos, Zuckerberg and Pichai testify before Congress on July 27. But will it be enough to evince significant change? At least one legal expert continues to have his doubts. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo they continue to act with impunity? Does the 2020 election change the calculus? There will be marginal changes on both counts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Andrew Jay Schwartzman, senior counselor with the Benton Institute for Broadband & Society, told MarketWatch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see any signs the companies are compelled to make fundamental changes in the course they have been following.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}]}
