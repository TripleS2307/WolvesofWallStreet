July 15 isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just the deadline to file federal income taxes. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the deadline when people trying to make a living off their stock market savvy need to tell the Internal Revenue Service how they want the tax agency to tabulate their gains and losses for the upcoming tax season. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no one-size answer on whether to go for the \u00e2\u0080\u009cmark-to-market election,\u00e2\u0080\u009d experts say. It can result in big time deductions for some, but big time headaches for others, they note. But a rookie trader with a rocky trading year in this volatile market should think hard about the option, they add. The mark-to-market election is like \u00e2\u0080\u009cfire insurance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to Darren Neuschwander, CPA and a managing member of Green, Neuschwander & Manning, a firm for traders and investments managers that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seen a 100% increase in prospective client consultations year-over-year. The election doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t boost someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s portfolio, but Neuschwander said it makes \u00e2\u0080\u009ca substantial difference when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re basically burning down in the market.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what to know about this tax move and other tax angles for day traders and retail investors:The IRS won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just let you call yourself a trader The IRS distinguishes between who counts as an \u00e2\u0080\u009cinvestor\u00e2\u0080\u009d for tax purposes and who counts as a \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrader.\u00e2\u0080\u009d For one thing, an investor can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get around the annual $3,000 capital loss limitation, but the trader can potentially write off much more, if they take certain steps. Also, trading is a business, even if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s for the trader\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal gain. As a business, there are potential business expenses write-offs including home office expenses, computer equipment, software, trading newsletters, according to Andrew Schmidt, an accounting professor at North Carolina State University. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tough to achieve trader status for tax purposes, Schmidt said. To be engaged in the business of securities trading, a person has to \u00e2\u0080\u009cseek to profit from daily market movements in the prices of securities and not from dividends, interest, or capital appreciation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the IRS says. Their activity has to be \u00e2\u0080\u009csubstantial\u00e2\u0080\u009d and done \u00e2\u0080\u009cwith continuity and regularity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the agency adds. The requirements to be trader for tax purposes can sound fuzzy, as MarketWatch tax expert Bill Bischoff notes. The tax code itself doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t lay down hard and fast eligibility rules, but Neuschwander said Tax Court cases give guidance. The case law says people who are traders for tax purposes need to make at least 720 trades in the year with an average holding period under 31 days. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approximately 250 trading days, Neuschwander noted. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss: IRS says evangelist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s private plane trips and tips to waiters aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tax deductible A trader\u00e2\u0080\u0099s profits are taxed at whatever bracket they fall in, which can range from 10% to 37%. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because net short-term capital gains are taxed as ordinary income using the escalating tax rates, according to the IRS. The long term capital gains rate \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for sale on an asset held over one year \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is 0% if a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s income is beneath $39,375 ($78,750 for a married couple), the IRS notes. For most others above that amount, the rate is 15%. The ups and downs on mark-to-market elections The IRS has a \u00e2\u0080\u009cwash sale rule,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which can kick in when someone sells a security at a loss and either buys or sells the same security or a similar one 30 days before or after that sale. An investor who buys or sells in that 30-day timeframe forfeits the potential capital loss write off, explained Tony Zabiegala, chief operations officer and senior wealth advisor at Strategic Wealth Partners in Cleveland, Ohio. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe government likes it when you pay taxes \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like be taken advantage of. They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like people who bought stock, decide to sell it, lock in a loss and re-buy to realize the loss,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. If a taxpayer convinces the IRS they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a trader, and if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made the mark-to-market election, they can sidestep the wash rule. They can also deduct all their losses, as opposed to an investor, who can only write off a $3,000 maximum every year after they also subtracted their net gains for the year. For example, if a trader loses $50,000 and their spouse earns $100,000, they can subtract the loss for a taxable income of $50,000 that would be taxed at 12%. If an investor loses $50,000 and their spouse makes $100,000, they could only write off the $3,000 and end with a taxable income of $97,000 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which is taxed at 22%. (The remaining losses can be carried forward and applied to future tax years.) To elect using mark-to-market rules under section 475(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, a taxpayer needs to enclose a cover letter with their 2019 returns saying they want to use that accounting method. If they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already submitted their returns, Neuschwander said they can print the first and second pages of their 2019 return, write \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo not process\u00e2\u0080\u009d and include a cover letter stating the election was inadvertently omitted. The post mark has to be by July 15, he noted. The mark-to-market election can sound enticing, but it can be a drawback in certain scenarios, Neuschwander said. Suppose a trader made a $50,000 profit, but they also have a $20,000 capital loss carryover of $20,000 from past years. Without the election for mark-to-market accounting, they can deduct the $20,000 from the $50,000 and just pay tax on $30,000. With the election, a trader cannot offset tax on the profits with the carryover. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll still have to pay tax on the $50,000. With more than five months before the year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s done, it may be tough for someone to game out how they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll end the year. But Neuschwander said it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a tax strategy they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to weigh one way or another. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re down for the year, which a lot people may have gotten into this first year\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 if they have enough trades, and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have that capital loss carry forward, you want that fire insurance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}]}
