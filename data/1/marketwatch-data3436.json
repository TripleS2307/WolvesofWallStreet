The increasing rate of new infections in states, including California, Texas and Florida is raising fears of a second wave breaking out just as business activity is resuming. The stock market, which has seemed resilient to much of the bad news on the virus, cratered after the latest jobless claims data showed more than 47 million people have sought benefits since the start of the outbreak. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC that shutting the economy for a second time is not a viable option. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, announced he will resume holding election rallies with the first in Tulsa, Oklahoma on June 19th and is not expected to require that attendees practice social distancing. Critics echoed the concerns of public-health experts that Americans will suffer unnecessary hardship and deaths if reopening continues to spread the virus. Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, said the pandemic is not over yet and described it as his worst nightmare after it took a single month to span the globe. Read now: Fauci calls pandemic his \u2018worst nightmare,\u2019 warns \u2018it isn\u2019t over yet\u2019 \u201cAfter months of failing to respond quickly or effectively to the COVID-19 crisis, the Trump administration appears to be trying out a new strategy: pretending the pandemic is over,\u201d said Kyle Herrig, president of nonpartisan watchdog Accountable.US in a statement. \u201cThe problem is, that won\u2019t stop the virus from spreading \u2014 nor will it help the millions of Americans struggling to make rent and put food on the table as the economy continues to struggle. \u201cPeople\u2019s lives are on the line \u2014 we need Trump to treat this pandemic with the seriousness it deserves and help keep the American people safe.\u201d Read:Yes, America needs to brace itself for a second wave of coronavirus All 50 states are in the process of reopening and some are even starting to allow visits to nursing home residents, about three months after they were stopped to avoid spreading the virus. West Virginia is allowing visitation by appointment from June 17, if the nursing home has had no cases of COVID-19 for at least the past 14 days. Massachusetts and Indiana, for example, already allow visits, only outside, and Ohio this week began allowing visits in assisted-living and intermediate-care facilities. In many other states, families often resort to visits through windows. Nursing home residents accounted for at least a quarter of the more than 113,000 Americans who have lost their lives to the pandemic, according to data compiled by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some 60,000 cases of illness have been reported, and nearly 26,000 of those residents died. Managing their reopening is viewed as a major test, ahead of the reopening of schools later in the year.

MRNA, +0.09% said it has finalized the Phase 3 study protocol for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, although the Phase 2 trial, which began dosing patients less than two weeks ago, has not been completed. Moderna has previously said it expects the experimental vaccine to move into Phase 3 trials in July if it is successful in the mid-stage study. The plans for the Phase 3 trial include a randomized, placebo-controlled study with about 30,000 participants in the U.S. The primary endpoint will test whether a 100 microgram dose of the investigational vaccine prevents symptomatic COVID-19 disease, and secondary endpoints will evaluate if the vaccine candidate can prevent severe forms of COVID-19 and infection from the virus at all. Moderna is ahead of the pack of drug companies and biotechs attempting to develop a COVID-19 vaccine. It\u2019s July trial is expected to be followed in August by a vaccine that is being co-developed by Oxford University and U.K. drug maker AstraZeneca AZN, +1.16%. In September, Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +1.39% will launch a trial involving its vaccine candidate. In other medical news, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. REGN, +0.36% said it started a Phase 1 clinical trial testing its experimental antibody cocktail aimed at both preventing and treating COVID-19. Regeneron plans to test the therapy in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, COVID-19 patients who aren\u2019t sick enough to be hospitalized, individuals who are at high risk of contracting the virus, and people who have reported close exposure to someone who has COVID-19. What\u2019s the economy saying? The latest Labor Department data showed the number of Americans applying for traditional jobless benefits in the latest week slowed to 1.54 million from a revised 1.9 million at the end of May. Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast 1.6 million new claims filed the usual way through state unemployment offices. New applications for benefits have dwindled since peaking at almost 7 million in late March, but they are still extremely high. Before the pandemic paralyzed the U.S. economy in March, new claims were running in the low 200,000s and sat near a 50-year low. But more than 47 million new jobless claims have been filed since the crisis took root three months ago, an unfathomable number that shows just how much devastation COVID-19 has caused to million of Americans and the U.S. economy. However, people have been returning to work as states reopen, and there are likely duplicative claims given many state employment offices have been overwhelmed, especially early in the crisis. \u201cThe worst in the labor market appears to be over, but it is still in terrible condition from the viral recession,\u201d said chief economist Gus Faucher of PNC Financial Services.
