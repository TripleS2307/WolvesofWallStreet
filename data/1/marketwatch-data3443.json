President Donald Trump sat down with Fox News host Laura Ingraham in the White House on Monday night, and the hour-long Q&A took some unexpected turns that went viral on social media overnight. Among the moments drawing the most debate on Tuesday morning: The president compared police shooting unarmed Black suspects, such as a Kenosha, Wis. officer shooting Jacob Blake in the back seven times last week, to a golfer choking under pressure. Trump agreed that firing seven bullets into Blake in front of his children was extreme. \u201cI mean, couldn\u2019t you have done something different? Couldn\u2019t you have wrestled him?\u201d he asked. Yet he outraged many viewers by adding, \u201cBut they choke, just like in a golf tournament, they miss a 3-foot putt.\u201d Ingraham cut him off, anticipating the blowback to the sound bite. \u201cYou\u2019re not comparing it to golf, because that\u2019s what the media would say,\u201d she said. The president\u2019s response? \u201cNo, I\u2019m saying people choke, and people are bad people,\u201d he said. \u201c[Police officers] can do 10,000 great acts, which is what they do, and one bad apple \u2014 or a choker, you know, a choker, they choke \u2014 shooting the guy in the back many times.\u201d Indeed, this drew a lot of backlash on Twitter TWTR, -0.23%, including from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who noted, \u201cYou know things are bad when Laura Ingraham has to save President Trump from saying stupid things.\u201d iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } The president alleged that people in the \u201cdark shadows\u201d are controlling his Democratic rival Joe Biden. Ingraham asked Trump, \u201cWho is pulling Biden\u2019s strings?\u201d He responded with, \u201cPeople that you\u2019ve never heard of, people that are in the dark shadows\u201d are controlling his presidential opponent. \u201cThere are people that are on the streets, there are people that are controlling the streets,\u201d he continued, but wouldn\u2019t elaborate, because he said the situation is under investigation. \u201cWe had somebody get on a plane from a certain city this weekend. And in the plane, it was almost completely loaded with thugs, wearing these dark uniforms, black uniforms, with gear and this and that,\u201d he continued. \u201cA lot of the people were on the plane to do big damage.\u201d Even Ingraham noted that \u201csounds like a conspiracy theory.\u201d Indeed, NBC News reported that the claim about the flight matches a viral Facebook FB, +0.26% post from June 1 that falsely claimed, \u201cAt least a dozen males got off the plane in Boise from Seattle, dressed head to toe in black.\u201d MSNBC political analyst Howard Fineman called these claims \u201ctruly nuts.\u201d And CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale said the \u201cdark shadows\u201d accusation was \u201calmost too stupid fact-check.\u201d iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Biden\u2019s campaign responded in a statement posted to Twitter early Tuesday morning that read: \u201cThe President of the United States is bizarrely highlighting the unrest and division he has stoked, refusing to condemn violence committed by his own supporters. Donald Trump\u2019s incomprehensible case for doing even more damage in a second term makes less and less sense every single day.\u201d The president said the suburbs are in danger from Biden \u2014 and Black Democratic Sen. Cory Booker \u2014 expanding low-income housing. Ingraham also asked Trump how he plans to win over women voters who might view him as too aggressive, which led him to segue into explaining how he plans to make women feel safe again by pushing for law and order. That includes keeping the suburbs \u201csafe\u201d by blocking the expansion of low-income housing there. \u201cThey were trying to destroy the suburbs,\u201d he said of the Democrats. \u201cThey want low-income housing, and with that comes a lot of other problems, including crime.\u201d Ingraham cut him off once again, interjecting with, \u201cYou\u2019re not saying poor people are criminals though.\u201d The president responded, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not saying that at all, but there is a level of violence that you don\u2019t see.\u201d He pointed to how he recently rescinded the Obama-era Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) rule, which housing advocates have said was necessary to fight racial segregation and discrimination in housing, but which Trump claimed has raised crime and hurt housing prices in those neighborhoods. Critics have called out the racist overtones of equating low-income housing with crime and neighborhood decline. And some accused Trump of racism again on Tuesday, especially after he called out Booker \u2014 a Black senator \u2014 for supporting the low-income housing expansion. Trump said Monday that Democrats are trying to build \u201clow-income housing projects right in the middle of your neighborhood,\u201d and argued that if Biden gets elected president, \u201cit\u2019s gonna go at a much higher rate than ever before, and you know who\u2019s gonna be in charge of it? Cory Booker.\u201d iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Trump also called the Black Lives Matter movement a \u201cMarxist organization,\u201d and once again claimed to have done more for America\u2019s Black community than any president in history, \u201cexcept for maybe Abraham Lincoln.\u201d Catch the full interview here."}]}
