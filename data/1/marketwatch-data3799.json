The ruling in the case involving Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance was a blow to Trump, who has long sought to keep his records private, but it does not mean that those records will be released soon, since they are being demanded as part of a confidential grand-jury investigation. The Supreme Court considered two sets of cases: a subpoena from Vance and subpoenas from three House of Representatives committees to Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s banks and his accounting firm. Vance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s subpoena sought eight years\u00e2\u0080\u0099 worth of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business and personal tax records. In the Vance case, Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyers have said he is immune from criminal investigation while in office. His lawyers have called the subpoenas from House Democrats \u00e2\u0080\u009cunprecedented,\u00e2\u0080\u009d though justices have disputed that, invoking prior Supreme Court losses by Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton when they sought to withhold information. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the opinions in both cases, which were each 7-2. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn our judicial system, \u00e2\u0080\u0098the public has a right to every man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s evidence.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Since the earliest days of the Republic, \u00e2\u0080\u0098every man\u00e2\u0080\u0099 has included the President of the United States,\u00e2\u0080\u009d wrote Roberts in the Vance case. In sending the congressional case back to the lower courts, Roberts wrote, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe courts below did not take adequate account of the significant separation of powers concerns implicated by congressional subpoenas for the President\u00e2\u0080\u0099s information.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s two high court appointees, Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, joined the majority in both cases along with Roberts and the four liberal justices. Trump has refused to release his tax returns ever since he was a presidential candidate. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, meanwhile, has released his.

Mazars also is the recipient of a subpoena from Vance. The committees subpoenaed the bank documents as part of their investigations into Trump and his businesses.
