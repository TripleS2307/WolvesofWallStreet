The trade union Lederne has stepped up its strike on the Norwegian continental shelf from Sunday midnight and as a result of the escalation Equinor has conducted a controlled closure of the Gudrun, Gina Krog, Kvitebjorn and Valemon fields. A total of 54 members of the trade union Lederne will be on strike at Gudrun, Gina Krog and Kvitebjorn, while the Valemon field must be shut down because it is linked to Kvitebjorn, Equinor said. Wage talks between the Norwegian Oil and Gas Association and the trade union Lederne broke down late last Tuesday. Agreements were reached with the other two trade unions involved in the talks, Industri Energi and Safe. In total, these six fields produce 330,000 barrels of oil equivalents per day, compared with total production of oil and gas on the Norwegian shelf of about 4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.
