Drew Angerer/Getty Images The coronavirus pandemic has many Americans heading for the hills \u2014 or the suburbs, as it were. And home prices in cities could decline as a result, says Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller. In an interview with CNBC CMCSA, -0.99%, Shiller outlined the broad risk to the economy posed by the spread of the novel coronavirus and the resulting impact on the global economy. \u201c \u2018People won\u2019t be willing to spend $1 million for a small condo in coming years if that\u2019s the way they feel.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Robert Shiller, Nobel Prize winning economist at Yale University \u201cWe have highly priced markets in the stock market, the bond market and the housing market,\u201d Shiller, who co-founded the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, said in the interview. \u201cAll of these markets could tumble in the coming months.\u201d Where housing is concerned though, the impact of a decline wouldn\u2019t be felt equally across all markets. Rather, Shiller laid out a worst-case scenario for urban markets around the U.S. \u201cWhat\u2019s nice about the city? It\u2019s good restaurants, theaters, museums, art shows,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re afraid of people because you think you might catch something in the next epidemic then it may color your whole feeling about the city.\u201d In addition to that fear, many employers have embraced remote working amid the coronavirus pandemic. Facebook FB, +0.26% has said it will ramp up hiring remote workers, while other firms have given workers the option to continue working from home indefinitely amid the pandemic. There\u2019s even a \u201cwork-from-home\u201d ETF that\u2019s aiming to capitalize on the trend. With living close to work less of a necessity, many Americans may see less of a reason to pay a premium to live in the city. That could accelerate a trend of people fleeing major cities that existed before the pandemic began. Also see: More than 20 million Americans may be evicted by September \u201cIt may cause price declines,\u201d Shiller said. \u201cPeople won\u2019t be willing to spend $1 million for a small condo in coming years if that\u2019s the way they feel.\u201d A drop in home prices would represent a major reversal. Data released last month showed that home prices continued to rise in April even as COVID-19 cases rapidly increased across the country. Economists have suggested that the low supply of homes for sale nationwide and the boost in demand prompted by low mortgage rates could keep prices elevated. On Tuesday, Fannie Mae FNMA, +0.73% upgraded its forecast for home price growth. Citing June housing data from CoreLogic CLGX, +0.86% that showed home prices rising at the fastest pace since November 2018, Fannie Mae now expects home prices to rise 4.4% this year. The mortgage giant\u2019s forecast last month called for only a 0.4% increase. Fannie Mae expects home price appreciation to slow in 2021 due to persistent elevated levels of unemployment caused by the pandemic. While the forecast calls for an increase in home prices, Fannie Mae economists did acknowledge that price changes could vary due to migration patterns. Some researchers have predicted that home prices will fall overall. \u201cIt\u2019s likely housing will feel the broader economy\u2019s downturn eventually, though to a mild degree, and home values will fall in the coming months,\u201d Zillow ZG, -0.42% senior principal economist Skylar Olsen said in a recent report."}]}
