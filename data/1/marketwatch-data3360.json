The number of cases in Tokyo rose to 60 on Sunday, highest since early May and nearly doubling from 31 five days ago. About half of recent daily confirmed cases have been detected among staff or customers of Tokyo\u2019s nightlife districts. Tokyo\u2019s numbers were at their highs since the late May lifting of a pandemic state of emergency. \u201cWe are closely watching the latest development,\u201d Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura told reporters. \u201cFrankly, this gives me a rather bad feeling.\u201d He said he planned to meet with Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike to discuss the situation and a new set of caution scale that would balance disease prevention with maintaining economic activity. Koike planned to announce a new set of infection monitoring measures on Tuesday. The latest cases brings Tokyo\u2019s total infections to 6,172, with 325 deaths \u2014 about one-third of national total."}]}
