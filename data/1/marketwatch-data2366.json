REGN, +0.36% gained 4.6% in premarket trading on Monday after the drugmaker said it had begun a Phase 3 clinical trial testing an antibody cocktail to prevent COVID-19. The study will specifically focus on the cocktail's efficacy preventing disease in 2,000 people who have been exposed to the virus by a close contact, such as a roommate. The trial is being operated by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. (A separate Phase 2/3 trial for the same antibody cocktail is testing the experimental therapy as a treatment in 2,900 COVID-19 patients who are being treated in hospitals and ambulatory settings. That trial is being run in the U.S. and in other countries like Brazil and Mexico.) On Thursday, Regeneron and Sanofi SNY, +0.89% had announced that a study evaluating their rheumatoid arthritis treatment Kevzara had failed to meet a Phase 3 trial's primary or secondary endpoints in a study testing the drug as a COVID-19 treatment; that announcement sent down Regeneron's shares in after-hours trading. Regeneron's stock is up 65.7% year-to-date, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% is down 3.1%."}]}
