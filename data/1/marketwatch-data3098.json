Kushner - who shares three children with his wife, first daughter Ivanka Trump - said that he will \"absolutely\" send them back to school in an interview on CBS's \"Face the Nation.\" \"Our school's not opening back up five days a week,\" he told the program. \"I wish they would, but we absolutely will be sending our kids back to school, and I have no fear in doing so.\" The president's son-in-law added that he wasn't concerned about his children being exposed to the virus. \"Children have a six times higher chance to die from the flu than from the coronavirus, so based on the data I've seen, I don't believe that's a risk,\" he said. Kushner said the president has taken a \"very aggressive approach\" to tackling the coronavirus pandemic, including promoting social distancing and fast-tracking the search for a cure. \"Most importantly, the president's really advanced the use of a lot of therapeutics, which is bringing the case fatality rate down better, which has been a good thing and obviously fast-tracking a vaccine\" Kushner said.
