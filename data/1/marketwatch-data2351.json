Intel INTC, -1.03% reported along with second-quarter earnings that the introduction of its 7-nanometer chips would be delayed by at least six months. AMD AMD, -3.94% is already selling 7-nm semiconductors for servers and PCs; in chip parlance, nanometers, or nm, refers to the size of the transistors that go on a computer chip, with the general rule being that smaller transistors are faster and more efficient in using power. \u201cWe have identified a defect mode in our 7-nanometer process that resulted in yield degradation,\u201d said Bob Swan, Intel\u2019s chief executive, on a conference call late Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019ve root-caused the issue and believe there are no fundamental roadblocks, but we have also invested in contingency plans to hedge against further schedule uncertainty.\u201d Those contingency plans could include using \u201csomebody else\u2019s foundry,\u201d Swan said on the call. For example, AMD uses Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. TSM, +1.11% to manufacture its 7-nm chips. Intel shares sank more than 10% after hours, following a 1.1% decline in the regular session to close at $60.40. On the other hand, AMD shares rallied 8% and American depositary receipts for TSMC rose more than 4% after hours. Intel\u2019s Swan said he expects Intel to ship its first 7-nm CPU products in late 2022 or early 2023, with data-center products coming out in the first half of 2023. \u201cThe 7-nm push isn\u2019t a positive announcement as many products were dependent on it,\u201d said Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. \u201cKnowing Intel, it always has backups for its backups and I am sure we will be hearing about enhancements to 10-nm to increase its competitiveness.\u201d \u201cWe now expect to increase our 10-nanometer base product shipments for the year by more than 20% versus our January expectations,\u201d Swan said on the call. The rest of Intel\u2019s earnings report showed that the chip maker continued to find strong demand for server and computer chips in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company reported second-quarter net income of $5.1 billion, or $1.19 a share, compared with $4.18 billion, or 92 cents a share, in the year-ago period. After adjusting for restructuring and acquisition-related costs, Intel reported earnings of $1.23 a share, compared with $1.06 a share in the year-ago quarter. Revenue grew 20% to $19.7 billion from $16.51 billion in the year-ago quarter. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had forecast adjusted earnings of $1.11 a share on revenue of $18.54 billion. Intel\u2018s reinstated guidance beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations. For the third quarter, Intel forecast adjusted earnings of $1.10 a share on revenue of approximately $18.2 billion; for the full year, Intel reinstated guidance of $75 billion in revenue and adjusted earnings of $4.85 a share. Analysts on average expected third-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.11 a share and revenue of $17.92 billion, while projecting full-year adjusted earnings of $4.81 a share and sales of $73.92 billion, according to FactSet. Intel finished Thursday with a market capitalization of $255.7 billion, and has been challenged recently for the market-cap lead in Silicon Valley\u2019s semiconductor sector by corporate neighbor and videogame-chip specialist Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.54%, which ended the trading session with a market cap of $249.2 billion, according to FactSet. Intel\u2019s financial performance withstood supply-chain problems when the pandemic caused shutdowns across China in the first quarter, and has largely thrived as COVID-19 spread due to cloud-computing needs and a surge in personal-computer sales. The company\u2019s sales of server chips rose 43% in the quarter, while the traditional PC segment grew 7%. For more: Intel has weathered coronavirus because of data center and PC sales Data-center group, or DCG, revenue rose to $7.1 billion, while analysts expected it to rise $6.61 billion, despite growing competition from AMD. Intel\u2019s largest segment \u2014 client-computing, the traditional PC group \u2014 rose to $9.5 billion, with analysts expecting a 2.9% rise to $9.1 billion amid strong sales of PCs in recent months. Memory chips have also been in demand for cloud-building \u201chyperscalers,\u201d and Intel reported that its nonvolatile memory solutions revenue rose 76% to $1.7 billion, while Wall Street expected a 37% rise to $1.29 billion. On the other hand, \u201cInternet of Things,\u201d or IoT, revenue was a disappointment, falling 32% to $670 million, compared with an expected 12% decline to $865.6 million. Mobileye revenue also declined, falling 27% to $146 million, while the Street had expected $217.4 million. While Intel shares were up less than 1% for the year to date at Thursday\u2019s close, AMD has gained 30% on the year and Nvidia\u2019s stock has rallied 72%."}]}
