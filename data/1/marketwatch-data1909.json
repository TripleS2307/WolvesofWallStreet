Services like Square Inc.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s SQ, +2.06% \u00c2 Cash App and PayPal Holdings Inc.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s PYPL, +2.18% \u00c2 Venmo found new uses during the height of the pandemic as people looked for ways to tip service workers, donate to causes, and patronize businesses that had moved to offer digital services during lockdowns. The services also allowed users to get their stimulus payments direct deposited through their platforms, which helped some people get their money more quickly and drove more users to try the Cash App, Venmo, and PayPal. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to look back and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be a really important inflection point\u00e2\u0080\u009d for these services, KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Josh Beck said of the COVID-19 crisis. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss: Square and PayPal finally have a chance to prove they can beat the banks \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to look back and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be a really important inflection point.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Josh Beck, analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets Square disclosed on its latest earnings call that direct deposit volumes on its service grew by three times in April as customers moved to store more than $1.3 billion in aggregate balances on the Cash app during the month. PayPal Chief Executive Dan Schulman said on his company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call that Venmo has \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecome much more central to people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s management and movement of money instead of just being a social payment [service].\u00e2\u0080\u009d The digital tailwinds likely gave a further boost to peer-to-peer services that Ark Invest analyst Max Friedrich estimates had already been growing faster than social-media services did in the U.S. back in the late 2000s and early 2010s. ARK Invest Like social-media platforms, peer-to-peer payments services benefit from network effects and become more valuable to users as more members of their social circles join. But unlike with \u00e2\u0080\u009ccool\u00e2\u0080\u009d social media sites, younger users actually have an incentive to bring their older relatives on board their payments services, helping to spur user growth, Friedrich told MarketWatch. Schulman said on PayPal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s earnings call last month that Venmo has become a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccross-generational platform\u00e2\u0080\u009d with \u00e2\u0080\u009centire families\u00e2\u0080\u009d now using the service to send money to one another. The network effects of peer-to-peer payments give PayPal and Square a leg-up on traditional banks, as well as challenger banks like Chime and Revolut, Friedrich said, contributing to lower customer acquisition costs because users are helping the companies do their marketing. Wells Fargo \u00e2\u0080\u009cliterally spends $500 million each year on postage and supply costs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Lower customer-acquisition costs help digital wallets like the Cash App and Venmo pick up unbanked customers, in his view, as these customers are typically viewed as unattractive for mainstream banks from a financial perspective. PayPal and Square both say their services are popular among unbanked and underbanked customers. While Venmo is viewed as more popular with coastal millennials, the Cash App has caught on in the South and the Midwest. Square announced Monday that it has acquired Verse, a startup from Spain that lets users transfer money to one another. Sending money to family and friends through peer-to-peer services is generally free, but PayPal and Square increasingly have been adding functions that allow them to make money off their user bases. Venmo and Cash App users can pay a fee to transfer their funds over to their bank accounts instantly or spend their funds with associated debit cards. Venmo users can also use a dedicated Venmo checkout button with some online merchants. Though both originated as peer-to-peer payment services, Venmo and the Cash App seem to be going in different directions as they build out their functionalities. PayPal is \u00e2\u0080\u009cstarting to play more of a commerce angle\u00e2\u0080\u009d with Venmo, in line with its broader strengths, while the Cash App is becoming \u00e2\u0080\u009cmuch more of a financial services platform,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Beck told MarketWatch. Square has allowed Cash App users to buy and sell bitcoin on the platform for years, and it recently added equities trading as well. The company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s debit card lets users choose amongst a rotating set of rewards including 10% off DoorDash orders or 10% off a purchase at any grocery store. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re likely to retain new users that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gotten from stimulus products or people looking to save money on non-discretionary items like groceries,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Beck said. For underbanked consumers, these perks are \u00e2\u0080\u009cexcellent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Eventually, the company could branch into adjacent areas, such as deposit accounts, savings accounts, credit cards, or loans, according to Beck. (On the merchant side of the business, Square has obtained conditional approval for a bank charter that will let it more easily distribute loans to sellers.) A company like Square could also more closely link its merchant and consumer businesses, Friedrich said, using coastal merchants to drive more Cash App users and allowing local businesses to offer targeted discounts to nearby Cash App users. The Holy Grail for PayPal, Venmo, and the Cash App is convincing users to set up direct deposits of their regular paychecks through these services, but that appears to be a tougher sell than it was for the one-time stimulus payments, said Lisa Ellis, a payments analyst at MoffettNathanson. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWherever your paycheck is going, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your home base, and banks typically own that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ellis told MarketWatch. She said that while some users who tried Venmo or the Cash App for the first time to access their stimulus payments may stick around and try out other features, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still an \u00e2\u0080\u009copen question\u00e2\u0080\u009d whether these users will deem the user experience to be so much better that it becomes worthwhile to set up direct deposits of their real paychecks. Square Chief Financial Officer Amrita Ahuja said on the last earnings call that direct-deposit customers \u00e2\u0080\u009chave generated revenue, which is multiples higher compared to customers who only use peer-to-peer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They typically carry higher balances and engage with more of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s services. Amassing regular direct-deposit customers could hinge on feature improvements. PayPal, for example, is making a large push into bill payments through a partnership with Paymentus, which aims to help customers more easily manage recurring bills. A better bill-pay experience could prompt more to ship their payments straight to PayPal or Venmo, Ellis said, since many people go to handle their bills shortly after getting paid. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe idea is that the large banks like Chase are working on something similar, but naturally not everyone banks with large banks and the small banks are nowhere on this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEven if Chase rolls it out, there are lots of customers out there who wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have access.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Venmo and the Cash App already have an edge on the traditional banks, according to Ark\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Friedrich, who estimates that each service had more active mobile users last year than any mainstream bank. He projects that there could be 220 million digital wallet customers by 2024 and calculates that if these customers were assigned a \u00e2\u0080\u009clifetime value\u00e2\u0080\u009d similar to that of traditional bank customers, it would represent a $800 billion opportunity. Of course, that assumes that Venmo and the Cash App morph into \u00e2\u0080\u009creal banking platforms\u00e2\u0080\u009d that generate \u00e2\u0080\u009creal banking revenues,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which Friedrich admits is a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbull-case scenario,\u00e2\u0080\u009d especially given that PayPal has proceeded more carefully with how it adds features to Venmo. Still, he said it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cinteresting to think about what scale [the digital wallets] could go to,\u00e2\u0080\u009d given the more optimal margin structures of digital banks. Investors, for their part, seem to be slowly coming around to the value of digital wallets. Beck said there was \u00e2\u0080\u009clow\u00e2\u0080\u009d investor reception when he suggested back in December a high standalone valuation for the Cash App, but now Wall Street appears to be looking past retail-related challenges for Square\u00e2\u0080\u0099s merchant business, in part due to the potential for a surge in Cash demand. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve very rarely seen a change in sentiment this quickly on a stock,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Beck said."}]}
