Staff members from the Democrat-controlled Transportation Committee blamed the crashes that killed 346 people on the \u201chorrific culmination\u201d of failed government oversight, design flaws and a lack of action at Boeing despite knowing about problems. The committee identified many deficiencies in the Federal Aviation Administration approval process for new jetliners. But both the agency and Boeing BA, -0.39% have said certification of the Max complied with FAA regulations, the 246-page report said. \u201cThe fact that a compliant airplane suffered from two deadly crashes in less than five months is clear evidence that the current regulatory system is fundamentally flawed and needs to be repaired,\u201d the staff wrote in the report released early Wednesday. The report highlights the need for legislation to fix the approval process and deal with the FAA\u2019s delegation of some oversight tasks to aircraft manufacturer employees, said Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio, D-Oregon. \u201cObviously the system is inadequate,\u201d DeFazio said. \u201cWe will be adopting significant reforms.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t give details of possible changes, saying committee leaders are in talks with Republicans about legislation. He said the committee won\u2019t scrap the delegation program, and he hopes to reach agreement on reforms before year\u2019s end."}]}
