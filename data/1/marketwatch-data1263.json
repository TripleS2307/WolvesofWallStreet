Roy Blunt, headed into a weekly a lunch with fellow Republicans, appeared to grin a bit behind his mask when asked if the price tag of the next coronavirus aid package would rise as the President Donald Trump\u2019s polling worsened. \u201cMy view has always been that the president would be supportive of big amounts of money going to the economy right now,\u201d he said. The Democrats\u2019 marker for the next package, the $3.448 trillion \u201cHeroes Act,\u201d won\u2019t be taken up by the Senate, but with only two weeks before senators come back from the July 4 break, Republicans like Missouri\u2019s Blunt face decisions on how to build a package and how big to make it. There are signs the discussions are breaking toward a \u201cbigger is better\u201d approach. Of course, how one defines \u201cbig\u201d is subjective. On ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she thought Republicans \u201cwill come around\u201d and support a large package. She said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has backed more spending, pointing to the risk of a worse recession. Republicans \u201cknow we have to have a bill,\u201d Pelosi said, adding that individual Republicans are calling her to make requests for items to be included in a final package. \u201c[Treasury] Secretary Mnuchin knows there has to be legislation,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be friendly.\u201d She said it was not time for face-to-face talks with Mnuchin, explaining that such negotiations typically come at the end of the process. Even though lawmakers are unlikely to turn in earnest to a fifth coronavirus relief package until late July, ideas are percolating. Trump, in a television interview Monday, said there would be another round of checks to individuals. \u201cWe will be doing another stimulus package. It\u2019ll be very good. It\u2019ll be very generous,\u201d he said. The White House has reportedly been considering a $1 trillion infrastructure package that could boost the economy. In recent days, a series of polls has shown Trump\u2019s re-election campaign facing a rockier path. New York Times polls Thursday showed him trailing in key battleground states crucial to his 2016 election, and the Real Clear Politics average of national polls put Trump behind presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden by 10 percentage points. While those factors may not be enough to nudge the White House and Senate Republicans all the way over to Pelosi\u2019s $3 trillion\u2013plus price tag, they could push them in that general direction. Steve Ellis, president of anti-spending group Taxpayers for Common Sense, said the Democrats put \u201ceverything thing they could think of\u201d in their bill. \u201cThey won\u2019t get all they want, but it is clear that the president and many senators want something, as well. It is better to do this package more targeted and thought out to ensure the assistance goes where it is most needed and effective,\u201d he said. Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican, said he can see the Paycheck Protection Program being extended and targeted to \u201cthose areas that were most dramatically impacted\u201d and possibly another payroll tax break, for workers and companies. \u201cIncentives to go back to work, yes. But to do it safely is the critical part,\u201d Rounds said. \u201cI think people, myself included, are watching the economic numbers carefully. All of the money we appropriated still has not yet been spent. The next bill, if there is one, will be very targeted,\u201d said Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated the first four coronavirus bills will cost about $2.404 trillion from 2020 to 2030. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan group focused on the debt, estimates about $1.8 trillion had been disbursed or allocated for disbursement by mid-June. However, some Republican senators are starting with a hard line. Sen. Ron Johnson, the Wisconsin Republican who chairs the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said: \u201cMy own advice is, let\u2019s take a look at what has not been obligated, not been spent, and see if there\u2019s a better way of directing that.\u201d \u201cI certainly do not think we\u2019re in a position today to have to authorize even a dollar more.\u201d Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat who sits on the Senate Small Business Committee, said factors other than politics could push Republicans toward agreeing to a bigger bill in July. \u201cThree things are coming together this month. The economy is not opening and growing as quickly as many of us had hoped. The pandemic is not as under control as many of us might have expected. And Americans are demanding action to respond to long-standing racial inequalities,\u201d he said. \u201cIf what my colleagues hear over the two weeks that they\u2019re back in their states is anything like I\u2019m hearing in Delaware, we\u2019ll end up doing a big package.\u201d"}]}
