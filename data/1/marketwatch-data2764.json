Phil Murphy on Monday tweeted that the state's plan to allow indoor dining later this week won't happen due to concerns that dining in restaurants in other states has led a spike in COVID-19 cases. He also said some restaurants or bars in N.J. are overcrowded, people aren't social distancing, and few people are wearing face coverings. \"We have decided to postpone indoor dining indefinitely,\" he wrote. Florida, Nevada, and South Carolina each reported the highest number of new infections in a single day, and outbreaks have been worsening in Californa and Texas. Murphy's decision to pause indoor dining, however, is the first slowdown in reopening plans in the tri-state area, which is recording far fewer cases of COVID-19 than it did at its peak. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the state will decide Wednesday whether to slow down the reopening of indoor dining there."}]}
