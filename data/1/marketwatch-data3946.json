Tesla rival Nio Inc.'s stock NIO, +0.14%  also soared, in the wake of the China-based EV maker's upbeat June sales report. Meanwhile, among other EV makers, shares of Workhorse Group Inc.

Brinkman said that the deliveries data led Chief Executive Elon Musk to imply Tesla's second-quarter report, due out on or about July 22, could produce a surprise break-even result. But he cautioned investors that any \"substantially better results\" could include items that are \"one-time or somewhat one-time in nature,\" such as zero-emission regulatory credit sales or the release of deferred revenue associated with autonomous driving features. Brinkman reiterated the underweight rating he's had on Tesla for at least the last three years, citing \"lofty valuation\" coupled with \"high investor expectations and high execution risk.\" \"Our underweight rating considers notable investment positives, including a highly differentiated business model, appealing product portfolio, and leading-edge technology, which we believe are more than offset by above-average execution risk and valuation that seems to be pricing in a lot,\" Brinkman wrote in a note to clients. Of the 32 analysts surveyed by FactSet, 12 have the equivalent of sell ratings on Tesla, while 11 have the equivalent of hold and 9 have the equivalent of buy. The average price target is $774.98, or 43.5% below current prices. FactSet Nio's stock ran up 22.7% to $11.51, to also record a fifth straight gain.
