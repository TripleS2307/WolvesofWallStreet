Tesla rival Nio Inc.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stock NIO, +0.14% \u00c2 also soared, in the wake of the China-based EV maker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s upbeat June sales report. Meanwhile, among other EV makers, shares of Workhorse Group Inc. WKHS, +12.62% \u00c2 pulled back after a record 11-day win streak and Nikola Corp. NKLA, -1.36% \u00c2 was headed for a fourth straight loss. Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stock TSLA, +1.89% \u00c2 shot up a record $162.92, or 13.5%, to $1,371.58.
