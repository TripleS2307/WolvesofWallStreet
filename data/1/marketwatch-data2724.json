Invoking Biden\u2019s tax plans, Trump also claimed that the former vice president would \u201ctax this country into a depression like in 1929.\u201d Trump spoke as Democrats are preparing to nominate Biden next week at their party\u2019s convention, which, while nominally being held in Milwaukee, will be an almost entirely virtual event as delegates and lawmakers stay home as a coronavirus precaution. Biden is leading Trump in national polls and in battleground states, including Florida, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Now see:The Obamas, AOC and Kamala Harris: Here\u2019s who\u2019s speaking to the Democratic convention and when Biden on Tuesday introduced his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, to the relief of some on Wall Street. Under a Biden administration, analysts have said health-care stocks XLV, +0.90% could benefit, while financials XLF, +0.11% may be negatively impacted. A recent analysis from Fidelity International found the opposite of what Trump argues. It said that a sweeping victory for Biden and Harris\u2014plus Democratic majorities in both houses of Congress\u2014would be the best outcome for markets in the long run. See:A Biden-Harris sweep would be best for markets, says Fidelity. What\u2019s more, wrote lead cross-asset strategist Wen-Wen Lindroth, a Trump win would bring added downside risk from factors including growing civil unrest and \u201cpotential for continued poor management of the Covid crisis, which increases the risks of a double-dip recession in the U.S.\u201d Trump charges that Biden\u2019s plans would decimate an economy that attempting to recover from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cThey\u2019re big taxers,\u201d he said of Biden and Harris. \u201cIt\u2019s just something that won\u2019t work.\u201d Among Biden\u2019s tax plans are hiking levies on individuals with incomes of more than $400,000. According to the nonpartisan but business-friendly Tax Foundation, Biden\u2019s plan would raise tax revenue by $3.8 trillion over the next decade, and reduce gross domestic product by 1.51% over the long term. Trump in the interview talked up his plans to cut capital-gains taxes, a proposal he has been touting this week along with a middle-income tax cut. \u201cWe are looking very seriously at a capital-gains tax cut, and also an income-tax cut for middle-income families,\u201d Trump said at a Monday news conference, claiming that a reduced taxation of capital gains would \u201ccreate a lot more jobs.\u201d Now read:Trump \u2018seriously\u2019 considers a capital-gains tax cut\u2014and here\u2019s how he could do it Sign up for Trump Today and more MarketWatch newsletters."}]}
