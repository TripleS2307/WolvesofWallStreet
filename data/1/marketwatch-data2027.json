Since January, Barber has had her wages garnished to repay about $10,000 in defaulted student loans. Barber works as a home health aide for a woman with cerebral palsy; her duties range from folding bed sheets to driving to doctor\u2019s appointments to playing board games. It\u2019s a job Barber loves for its variety, but it can be hard to make ends meet.. \u201cMy yearly salary right now is about $20,000,\u201d Barber said. \u201cSo trying to keep up with the town taxes, trying to keep up with the gas and electric and everything, and then the garnishment on top of that, and then possibly my hours dwindling \u2014 I was panicking. I was just absolutely panicking.\u201d \u201c \u2018I was panicking. I was just absolutely panicking.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Elizabeth Barber, who had her paychecks garnished over defaulted student loans during the CARES Act collections pause In March, Congress passed a coronavirus relief bill, known as the CARES Act, that included a provision pausing payments and collections on student loans owned by the Department of Education. It\u2019s a law Barber could have benefited from, but she hadn\u2019t heard of it and at least through April, the news wasn\u2019t showing up in her paycheck. During a period of a few weeks when the wage garnishment was supposed to have been turned off, the government took roughly $165 from Barber\u2019s paychecks, according to court documents. Eventually, Barber got that money back, but only after filing a lawsuit with the help of the National Student Legal Defense Network, an organization founded by alums of the Obama-era Department of Education that represents student loan borrowers and for-profit college students, and the National Consumer Law Center. An agency spokeswoman said previously that the Department was working with its default loan servicer to contact employers by phone, emails and mail to stop wage garnishment. For Barber, the halt in garnishment has helped her catch back up on her bills, but she\u2019s not sure how she\u2019ll cope once the relief period ends on September 30. \u201cThe pause is good,\u201d she said, \u201cBut September is still looming and unless I can get another job, it is going to be tough going.\u201d Barber and other borrowers\u2019 experiences when the Department of Education turned off student loan collections to comply with the CARES Act has advocates worried about what will happen when the agency turns that machinery back on in a few months. \u201cFrom the perspective of all of the people that have reached out to us,\u201d said Alex Elson, senior counsel at NSLDN who is representing Barber and other, similarly situated borrowers, \u201cI\u2019m just very concerned that September 30 right now feels like a kind of arbitrary date. To turn it right back on again, it\u2019s a frightening prospect for tens of thousands of people.\u201d Kicking the can down the road Some borrowers who have defaulted on their loans, like Barber, will face the resumption of wage garnishment. But even those who are current on their loans could be coping with administrative and financial headaches once payments resume. For years, borrower advocates have complained that student loan servicers \u2014 borrowers\u2019 main point of contact when repaying their debt \u2014 don\u2019t do enough to ensure borrowers have access to the affordable repayment plans they\u2019re entitled to by law. Add to that an economic crisis that is likely making it difficult for thousands of borrowers to manage their bills and the fact that this is the first time the government has ever shut off and turned back on student loan payments for all of its millions of borrowers and the challenges could be unprecedented. The payment pause has \u201cmerely kicked the can down the road,\u201d for the struggle borrowers are facing managing their student loans, said Seth Frotman, the executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center, a borrower advocacy group. \u201c \u2018What\u2019s really frightening is the idea that millions and millions of people are going to need to reach out for help.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Seth Frotman, the executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center \u201cWhat\u2019s really frightening is the idea that millions and millions of people are going to need to reach out for help,\u201d said Frotman, who was also the student loan ombudsman at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is these student loan companies are ill-equipped to handle it on a good day. It seems as if there\u2019s zero planning, zero effort put into how we could be better accommodating the real plight of student-loan borrowers over the long-term.\u201d Angela Morabito, a spokeswoman for the Department of Education, wrote in an emailed statement that communications will be sent to borrowers beginning in August as required by the CARES Act. \u201cThe series of communications will inform borrowers that the administrative forbearance and 0% interest period will end and loan repayment will begin after Sept. 30, 2020,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe will also use social media and other channels to reach borrowers, and we plan to work with partners to help spread the word.\u201dEconomic fallout from the pandemic continues The economic fallout from the pandemic is still ongoing, which could complicate borrowers\u2019 ability to repay their debts. Roughly 22 million Americans lost their jobs during the height of the pandemic and the U.S. has only regained 7.5 million of those in May and June. In addition, many of the other efforts aimed at providing economic relief, like eviction moratoriums, will soon be lifted, exacerbating borrowers\u2019 challenges affording their student loan bills. Roughly 33% of federal student loan borrowers said they were already struggling to afford their monthly payments before the coronavirus pandemic, according to a survey of more than 38,000 people released in May by Student Debt Crisis, an advocacy group, and Savi, a company offering a tool borrowers can use to identify and enroll in repayment and forgiveness plans. But that share goes up once the payment pause ends; 46% said they expected to struggle to make their payments in six months. \u201cA six month payment pause was somewhat based on the idea that in six months the economy would be better and this was just the breathing room borrowers needed,\u201d said Persis Yu, the director of the Student Loan Borrower Assistance Project at NCLC. \u201cThe pandemic is not over, in many places, it\u2019s getting dramatically worse. It seems to me that we\u2019re not going to be ready on October 1 to really turn the system back on from the borrower finance perspective.\u201d Those issues could be exacerbated by logistical challenges. The machinery of the student loan system features many players: The Department of Education owns the loans and also hires servicers and debt collectors to manage them. Those relationships are governed by contracts that can be difficult to adjust quickly for extenuating circumstances. Government watchdog highlights challenges turning the student-loan collection system off A June report from the Government Accountability Office on federal agencies\u2019 administration of the CARES Act highlighted these challenges. The report noted that the Department was slow to turn off wage garnishment with some borrowers still seeing their wages seized into June 2020 because the agency first had to get in touch with their employers in writing, who would stop the garnishment. In addition, the agency \u201cfaced challenges in providing borrowers with timely and accurate information,\u201d about the CARES Act payment pause to borrowers in its initial weeks, the GAO noted. Increased call volume to servicers meant that there were higher-than-usual instances of dropped calls and in some cases representatives provided borrowers with inaccurate information. Suspended interest accruals and payments also didn\u2019t show up immediately on borrowers\u2019 accounts, according to the GAO. The report also touched on a headline-grabbing error by one of the agency\u2019s student loan servicers that left millions of borrowers with temporary downgrades to their credit scores. In comments to the GAO, Mitchell Zais, the deputy secretary of education, called the report, \u201cfundamentally flawed, inaccurate, incomplete and unfair.\u201d \u201cThe federal student loan provisions of the CARES Act required [Federal Student Aid] to assist virtually every borrower across the entire federally held student loan portfolio,\u201d Zais wrote. \u201cIn essence, FSA accomplished the enormous task of modifying payment and other requirements for more than 40 million borrowers in a matter of weeks.\u201d The issues highlighted in the GAO report \u2014 as well as evidence that a lack of communication during past, smaller payment pauses for other emergencies allowed borrowers to slip into default \u2014 have consumer advocates eyeing the Department\u2019s plans closely for October 1. They worry that if the government and servicers botch the resumption of payments, a wave of defaults could result. \u201c \u2018Nobody has turned off the collection system for the federal government before for everybody \u2018 \u201d \u201cThis has never happened before,\u201d said David Bergeron, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank, who also worked at the Department of Education for more than three decades. \u201cNobody has turned off the collection system of the federal government before for everybody.\u201d Manual fixes that could be implemented for borrowers having issues during Hurricane Maria or Katrina-related payment pauses \u201cjust don\u2019t work when you\u2019re to the scale of everybody who has a student loan that is held by the federal government,\u201d he said. Only recently have borrowers even begun to understand the contours of the CARES Act payment pause, said Cody Hounanian, the program director of Student Debt Crisis. Roughly 36% of federal student loan borrowers had no idea relief was available when their survey was released in May. \u201cWe\u2019ve finally gotten to a place of some settledness and now we\u2019re going to be disrupted all over again,\u201d he said. Advocates and servicers worry about a crush of calls Of particular concern for advocates and servicers is the likelihood that many borrowers who have had their financial circumstances change during the payment pause will be flooding the system with requests to change their repayment plan once the pause is over. Federal student loan borrowers are entitled to make payments tied to their income through what are known as income-driven repayment plans. But getting into those programs involves paperwork and time from servicer call center representatives. Consumer advocates and state attorneys general have complained for years that instead of taking this more time-consuming approach, servicers have pushed struggling borrowers towards forbearance, a status that pauses payments, but can ultimately be costly because of the way interest builds during the period. \u201cIf those calls all come on September 29, that\u2019s going to be a real practical challenge,\u201d Scott Buchanan, the executive director of the Student Loan Servicing Alliance, a trade group, said of requests for payment plan changes. To try to avoid this deluge of calls, his organization and the companies that it represents are working with the Department of Education to develop a communications strategy, he said. They\u2019re considering creating more targeted communications to send to borrowers who are likely struggling and may need extra assistance transitioning back into repayment, he said. In addition, the companies are also trying to ensure that they align the timing of messages with appropriate levels of staffing because the messages are \u201cgoing to be a driver of demand in the customer service center,\u201d Buchanan said. \u201cAt the beginning of this when the President announces the suspension of payment in a news conference without much notice and then we\u2019re slammed with phone calls \u2014 that\u2019s the kind of thing we want to avoid,\u201d he added. The companies are also preparing for the likely scenario that they don\u2019t reach every borrower before payments resume, Buchanan said. Though interest will begin accruing on October 1, there is a delay between a borrower missing a payment and consequences, like late fees or reporting to credit bureaus. \u201cOftentimes not everyone is going to respond and so we\u2019re going to have to catch some of these folks after we cross that line \u2014 it\u2019s not what we want to do,\u201d Buchanan said, adding that no matter how many times servicers reach out to borrowers, \u201cpeople are really focused on their day-to-day in these times of crisis.\u201dIf you\u2019re financial situation has changed, get help now Advocates and servicers agree that borrowers whose financial situations may have changed since the beginning of the payment pause should reach out to their student loan companies now and ask to enroll in an income-driven repayment program. That way, borrowers can start the process of switching repayment plans during a period when servicers aren\u2019t as likely to be facing a crush of calls and with enough time to make sure their monthly payment is affordable by the time collections resume. \u201cThe things that they got wrong shutting down, they should be very deliberate in making sure it goes right when turning it back out,\u201d Bergeron said of the Department of Education. \u201cIt\u2019s a do-over and no one gets do-overs, the Department should take advantage of it and so should borrowers.\u201d"}]}
