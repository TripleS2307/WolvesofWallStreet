This chart might have you rethinking your investment", "body": "Apple shares opened the week with another strong push to the upside, rallying toward a fourth straight record and approaching a $2 trillion valuation. Excitement is running high thanks to the \u201cmassive pent-up iPhone 12 cycle,\u201d according to Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives, who just raised his price target on the stock to $450 from $425. \u201cWe believe in China alone between 60 million to 70 million iPhones are in the window of an upgrade opportunity over the next year with Apple going aggressively at all price points (SE, iPhone 12) to cement its installed base despite competitive pressures from domestic players,\u201d he wrote, adding that he believes Apple could be the first company to notch a $2 trillion market cap. Jesse Felder of the popular Felder Report, however, tapped the brakes on the bullishness. He tweeted this chart to show how Apple\u2019s rally \u2014 up about 40% over the past three months \u2014 has pushed the stock to risky levels compared with how the business is actually faring. \u201cApple just passed its all-time peak valuation seen in mid-2007 when revenues were growing 90% year-over-year as a result of the introduction of the iPhone,\u201d Felder wrote in the tweet. \u201cRevenues for the company\u2019s fiscal Q3 ending in June are expected to fall 5%.\u201d As one of his followers pointed out, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much a videogame at this point. I\u2019m a big AAPL fan, but it\u2019s stock trades nothing like it\u2019s fundamentals.\u201d Apparently, that doesn\u2019t matter to investors buying into Apple\u2019s future. A recent peek into Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway shows almost half of the company\u2019s $214 billion publicly traded portfolio is made up of Apple stock. It\u2019s not just individual investors, like 30-something billionaire Ryan Cohen and his massive stake, who are relying heavily on Apple\u2019s performance. The market, as a whole, has become increasingly dominated by Apple and a few other big tech names. If it weren\u2019t for the huge gains logged by the \u201cGiant 5,\u201d Apple AAPL, +1.74% , Microsoft MSFT, +2.48% , Amazon AMZN, +3.01% , Alphabet GOOG, +1.97% and Facebook FB, +0.26%, the broader market has delivered virtually nothing in recent years. At last check, Apple was up more than 3% Monday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% , S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% and Nasdaq COMP, +1.39% were all moving higher."}]}
