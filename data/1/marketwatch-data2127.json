Consumer spending rose 1% in August, the government said Thursday, matching the forecast of economists polled by MarketWatch. Slower spending stemmed largely from the end of a massive infusion of federal aid for the unemployed. Incomes declined by 2.7% \u2014 the biggest drop since early in the pandemic \u2014 after an extra $600 jobless stipend expired. Wages and salaries rose, however. What\u2019s more, many households boosted savings early in the pandemic, giving them more cushion to spend. The savings rate fell again to 14.1%, but it\u2019s still almost twice as high as it was before the pandemic. The return of millions of people to the workforce and the reopening of more businesses has also kept spending on the up and up.

These are the sort of discretionary purchases that tend to reflect greater confidence in the economy. Consumers go out to eat and travel less when they are anxious.

Spending is still about 4% lower compared to the last month before the pandemic, however. A closely watched measure of inflation, meanwhile, rose sharply for the third straight month as prices recovered from a big drop early in the pandemic. The PCE index, the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation barometer, rose 0.3%. The yearly rate of inflation was still quite tame, however, at 1.4%. It was running close to 2% just a few months before the disease spread to the United States. A separate measure of inflation that strips out food and energy, known as the core rate, also rose 0.3% in August. It\u2019s risen just 1.6% in the past year, however. See: MarketWatch Economic Calendar Big picture: Many economists worry spending will slow further unless the government provides more support for the unemployed. A $600 federal stipend ran out at the end of July after Democrats and Republicans deadlocked on a new financial rescue package. Yet the economy has also shown a lot of resilience, other analysts say, and it\u2019s likely to keep expanding even if Washington doesn\u2019t come through with another big financial-aid package. Business restrictions across the country are gradually being lifted and the economy is adding more jobs than it\u2019s losing.
