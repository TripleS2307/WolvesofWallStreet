Hertz HTZ, -1.78% filed Monday to offer up to $500 million in shares, aiming to cash in on a surge in investor\u2019s interest on its rallying stock despite having filed for bankruptcy protection on May 22, drowning in debt and hit hard by global restrictions on travel designed to slow to spread of the coronavirus pandemic. In the Wednesday filing, Hertz said it had been \u201cadvised orally\u201d by employees with the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s division of corporation finance on Monday afternoon that they planned to review the offering\u2019s prospectus. After discussions with the SEC employees, sales \u201cwere promptly suspended pending further understanding of the nature and timing of the staff\u2019s review,\u201d Hertz said in Wednesday\u2019s filing. The company\u2019s advisers \u201chave been in regular contact with the Commission\u201d since that initial contact, Hertz said. Earlier Wednesday, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton told CNBC the regulator had issues with Hertz\u2019s plan to sell potentially worthless stock, and that it had let Hertz know it had \u201ccomments\u201d on the company\u2019s disclosure. In most cases companies would then halt their efforts until the issues were resolved, Clayton said. A bankruptcy judge late Friday ruled in favor of Hertz\u2019s proposal, surprising many investors. In the Monday\u2019s share-offering prospectus, Hertz repeatedly warned potential investors its shares could end up being \u201cworthless\u201d amid the bankruptcy proceedings. The filing, studded with other dire warnings, was also notable for what it didn\u2019t have: Any details about a reorganization plan and what would happen with Hertz assets, many of which are tied to securities. Shares of Hertz shot higher after the halt,which came in midday trading. They pared some gains as the session drew to a close, however. The stock is up 96% so far this month, compared with gains around 2% and 3% for the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% in the same period. The stock is down 87% so far this year."}]}
