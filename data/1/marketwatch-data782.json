Those efforts appear to be part of a broader increase in targeting of U.S. political campaigns and related groups, the company MSFT, +2.48% said. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is consistent with previous attack patterns that not only target candidates and campaign staffers but also those who they consult on key issues,\u201d Tom Burt, a Microsoft vice president, said in a blog post. \u201c The same GRU military intelligence unit, known as Fancy Bear, that Microsoft identifies as being behind the current election-related activity also broke into voter registration databases in at least three states in 2016. \u201d Most of the infiltration attempts by Russian, Chinese and Iranian agents were halted by Microsoft security software and the targets notified, he said. The company would not comment on who may have been successfully hacked or the impact. Microsoft did not assess which foreign adversary poses the greater threat to the integrity of the November presidential election. The consensus among cybersecurity experts is that Russian interference is the gravest. Senior Trump administration officials have disputed that, though without offering any evidence.

It interfered in the 2016 campaign seeking to benefit the Trump campaign by hacking the Democratic National Committee and emails of John Podesta, the campaign manager of Hillary Clinton, and dumping embarrassing material online, congressional and FBI investigators have found. The same GRU military intelligence unit, known as Fancy Bear, that Microsoft identifies as being behind the current election-related activity also broke into voter registration databases in at least three states in 2016, though there is no evidence it tried to interfere with voting. Microsoft, which has visibility into these efforts because its software is both ubiquitous and highly rated for security, did not address whether U.S. officials who manage elections or operate voting systems have been targeted by state-backed hackers this year. U.S. intelligence officials say they have so far not seen no evidence of that. They said last month t hat the Russians favor President Donald Trump and the Chinese prefer former vice president Joe Biden, the Democratic challenger. But China is largely an espionage threat, while Russia steals data and weaponizes it. In a Washington Post opinion piece this week, Susan Gordon, the deputy director of national intelligence from 2017-19, said that \u201cRussia\u2019s intent is to undermine American democracy\u201d while China seeks, by contrast, to shape U.S. policy and erode U.S. global influence, in part by the theft of intellectual property. Thomas Rid, a Johns Hopkins geopolitics expert, said he was disappointed by Microsoft\u2019s refusal to differentiate threat level by state actor. \u201cThey\u2019re lumping in actors that operate in a very different fashion, probably to make this sound more bipartisan,\u201d he said. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand why.\u201d Microsoft said in the past year it has observed attempts by Fancy Bear to break into the accounts of people directly and indirectly affiliated with the U.S. election, including consultants serving Republican and Democratic campaigns and national and state party organizations \u2014 more than 200 groups in all. Also targeted was the center-right European People\u2019s Party, the largest grouping in the European Parliament. A party spokesperson said the hacking attempts were unsuccessful. The German Marshal Fund of the United States, a think tank, was another target. A spokesperson said there was no evidence of intrusion. Microsoft did not say whether Russian hackers had attempted to break into the Biden campaign but did say that Chinese hackers from the state-backed group known as Hurricane Panda \u201cappears to have indirectly and unsuccessfully\u201d targeted the Biden campaign through non-campaign email accounts belonging to people affiliated with it. The Biden campaign did not confirm the attempt, although it said in a statement that it was aware of the Microsoft report. The blog post said Iranian state-backed hackers have unsuccessfully tried to log into accounts of Trump campaign and administration officials between May and June of this year. \u201cWe are a large target, so it is not surprising to see malicious activity directed at the campaign or our staff,\u201d Trump campaign deputy press secretary Thea McDonald said. She declined further comment. In June, Google GOOG, +1.97% GOOGL, +1.82% disclosed that Hurricane Panda had targeted Trump campaign staffers while Iranian hackers had attempted to breach accounts of Biden campaign workers. Such phishing attempts typically involve forged emails with links designed to harvest passwords or infect devices with malware. Although both Attorney General William Barr and national-security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien have both said China represents the greatest threat to U.S. elections, the only mention of a Trump administration official targeted by Chinese hackers is \u201cat least one prominent individual formerly associated with\u201d the administration. Graham Brookie, director of digital forensic research at the Atlantic Council, disputes Barr and O\u2019Brien\u2019s claim that China poses the greater threat to this year\u2019s election. His lab is at the forefront of unearthing and publicizing Russian disinformation campaigns. See:A look at claims made by William Barr on mail-in voting, China and more in his Wolf Blitzer interview on CNN Brookie confirmed that his employer was among targets of Hurricane Panda but said there was no evidence the hacking attempts, which he said were unsuccessful, had anything to do with the 2020 election. \u201cWe have every indication that this was an instance of cyber-espionage, information gathering, as opposed to electoral interference,\u201d he said. By contrast, Brookie said, \u201cit\u2019s pretty evident that the Russian attempts [Microsoft disclosed] were focused on electoral processes and groups working on that.\u201d Don\u2019t miss:Homeland Security whistle-blower says he was pressured to alter intelligence on Russia and white supremacists to match Trump preferences"}]}
