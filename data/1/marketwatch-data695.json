The research, jointly commissioned by Airlines U.K., International Airlines Group, Heathrow Airport and aviation services company Collinson, said that the hit to U.K. gross domestic product in 2020 could reach at least \u00a311 billion, with a significant proportion falling in the fourth quarter. Heathrow Airport Chief Executive John Holland-Kaye said this was a \u201cstark warning\u201d and that action is needed immediately to safely open up connections with the U.S., the country\u2019s most important economic partner. \u201cWe can start with flights to New York, a city where infection rates are now lower than here, and which is the U.K.\u2019s most valuable route,\u201d Holland-Kaye said.

Visitors from the U.S. spent a total of \u00a33.8 billion ($4.9 billion) during 2019, but this figure is expected to fall by \u00a33.1 billion ($4 billion) in 2020, the report warned. \u201cCritically, the average duration of a trip by U.S. visitors is seven days, meaning that current quarantine rules effectively lock these high-spending visitors out of the U.K.,\u201d the report added.

Shai Weiss, chief executive of Virgin Atlantic, which is 49% owned by Delta Air Lines DAL, +0.39%, called for urgent government action to introduce regional travel corridors for mainland U.S. states, starting with New York and New Jersey, where infection rates are lower than the U.K.\u2019s. \u201c[The] 14-day quarantine must be replaced by a robust passenger-testing regime for countries and regions where the risk is higher,\u201d Weiss said. British Airways Chief Executive \u00c1lex Cruz cautioned that time is running out and called for ministers to reach agreement with their U.S. counterparts on a testing regime that minimizes quarantine and permits regional travel corridors to reopen the U.K.-U.S. market. \u201cThey must learn from trials across the globe and start implementing new measures as soon as possible to return confidence in flying and protect thousands of jobs,\u201d Cruz said."}]}
