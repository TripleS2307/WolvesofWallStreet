Oh, I know. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve just spent the summer and into the fall extolling the glories of curbside dining, that coronavirus middle ground between take-out-and-delivery-only and what we have again in New York City as of this week, limited indoor service in the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remaining restaurants. I say remaining restaurants because many have already closed after six-and-a-half months of pandemic restrictions. The ones that survive have done it with a painful mix of staff cuts, altered menus, reimagined concepts, customer loyalty and, as of June 22, tables in the gutter, tables on the sidewalk, tables on rooftops, tables in vacant lots, tables in all kinds of places there\u00e2\u0080\u0099d never been tables before. \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u009cSixty reservations. The people have been calling. They are saying, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I want to eat inside. Do you have a table inside?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 We are very happy we are open and we can call our staff back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Avtar Walia, owner of Tamarind restaurant And thank God for all of them, given the bleak alternative. The outside dining, which Mayor Bill de Blasio just made permanent, brought much needed revenue to the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gasping restaurants and gave cooped-up New Yorkers a relatively safe place to go, the affluent ones who hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t already abandoned the city for their beach houses and summer homes. But time marches on, even during a pandemic, and there I was again, finally enjoying a dinner out with four walls around me and a roof over my head. Quite a nice one, actually. I thought carefully about my return to indoor dining. I decided that, for the sake of continuity, the first supper should be exactly where the last supper was: at Tamarind on Hudson Street in Tribeca, one of the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2 and maybe the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0094 top Indian kitchens, where everything is expertly prepared, impeccably served and presided over by the elegant and demanding Avtar Walia. Walia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s immigrant story is an inspiring one. He came to New York from Punjab in northern India. After toiling as a warehouse manager for Gucci and a captain in several of the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Tandoor restaurants, he opened his own Indian fine-dining establishment, first on East 22nd Street and then further downtown in Tribeca. We couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get our regular table. Our regular table is the bar. The city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current rules say no bar seating and no more than 25% capacity overall. The rules say a lot of other things too, including that the indoor tables, like the outdoor tables, must be at least 6 feet apart. In fact, our deuce on the banquette was a good 10 or 12 from the tables on either side. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt feels normal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said our server, Corina Vlas, as she delivered the opening papadum, thin, crisp, round, seasoned flatbread, a promising start. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was expecting it to feel different,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut it feels surprisingly the same.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dining at 25% capacity at Tamarind. Ellis Henican/MarketWatch I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say for sure how much was the chef and how much was my long-delayed relief at being back, but every sip and morsel after that hit me like a heightened experience. The tart ginger pepper martini. The Punjabi tikhe kabab marinated in yogurt, roasted whole spices, jalape\u00c3\u00b1os, ginger and garlic. The saag paneer, a spicy spinach dish. To sop it all up, some chewy and faintly warm rosemary naan. And at the end, a semi-frozen chunk of pistachio kulfi, somewhere between ice cream and sorbet and yet totally different from either of those. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure it would have all tasted great on the sidewalk. But at a time as desperate as this one, each baby step toward normalcy is worthy of celebration. And to me, this one felt like a giant leap.

He\u00e2\u0080\u0099d never stopped doing takeout and delivery. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099d offered outside dining on the Hudson and Franklin Street sidewalks from the day City Hall said OK. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099d used the months from then till now to replace the upholstery, paint the walls, renovate the bathrooms and perform other upgrades. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSixty reservations,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he marveled on Thursday night. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe people have been calling. They are saying, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I want to eat inside. Do you have a table inside?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 We are very happy we are open and we can call our staff back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been quite a journey, he said, and an expensive one. The landlord has been impossible, demanding every last penny of the $63,000-a-month rent. And inspectors from several city agencies, including the health and transportation departments, came by. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey measure the distances,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Walia said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey tell me exactly where the tables can be and where to put the partition. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You can put the chairs on this side but not on that side.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d All of which, he said, was fine with him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy message to diners? Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be scared. Every single restaurant has to comply with the rules and regulations. They have proper air filters. They have the distance. They are fully prepared for you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As for my regular table? \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can do the same distancing up there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey should let us open the bar.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ellis Henican is an author based in New York and a former newspaper columnist."}]}
