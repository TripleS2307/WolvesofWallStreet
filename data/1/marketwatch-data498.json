U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson acknowledged there would be \u201ctough times ahead\u201d in the jobs market following Cineworld\u2019s announcement, but encouraged people to go to the movies. Cineworld\u2019s move comes after the release of the latest James Bond film, \u201cNo Time to Die\u201d was delayed for the second time. The MGM film had been due to be released in April this year, but was then postponed until November because of the pandemic. It is now expected to be released on April 2, 2021. Cineworld UK:CINE Chief Executive Mooky Greidinger said the closure of its 663 cinemas was \u201cnot a decision we made lightly.\u201d \u201cWe did everything in our power to support safe and sustainable reopenings in all of our markets,\u201d Greidinger said.

It\u2019s Not the Only Theater in Trouble. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } All operations will be suspended at 536 theaters in the U.S. and 127 Cineworld CNNWF and Picturehouse theaters in the U.K. from Oct. 8. The company didn\u2019t give a date for reopening its cinemas. Shares in Cineworld, which plunged 57% when the market opened, were trading 27.77% lower in early morning trading on Monday. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the beleaguered entertainment industry has taken another huge blow with the confirmation that all of Cineworld\u2019s venues will close their doors temporarily. \u201cAlthough the delay of the latest 007 blockbuster prompted the decision, Bond isn\u2019t the villain in this piece. The spread of COVID-19 around the world has been a horror movie for the industry and the fresh wave of infections is the latest installment in what\u2019s been a devastating story for cinema chains,\u201d Streeter said. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Cineworld\u2019s announcement follows a series of high-profile delays in recent weeks, including the Fast & Furious sequel, F9, which has been delayed until the end of May 2021, analysts at Citigroup said. \u201cThe only major release post the peak of COVID, the highly anticipated \u201cTenet,\u201d has delivered a disappointing performance. It seems that there is a vicious circle \u2014 with concerns over audience levels, the studios are unwilling to release their strongest content. And without decent content, audience levels are unlikely to return any time soon,\u201d the analysts added. Read: \u2018Tenet\u2019 earns $20.2 million in U.S. debut, in big test for box office \u201cWithout these new releases, Cineworld cannot provide customers in both the U.S. and the U.K. \u2014 the company\u2019s primary markets \u2014 with the breadth of strong commercial films necessary for them to consider coming back to theaters against the backdrop of COVID-19,\u201d Cineworld said. The entertainment industry has been among the hardest hit by social distancing and other restrictions, with the pandemic forcing U.S. and U.K. cinemas to close in mid-March.

On Friday, S&P Global Ratings on Friday downgraded the debt of AMC Entertainment, estimating that it has six months of cash left unless the situation materially improves. The boss of cinema chain Vue International, Tim Richards, told BBC Radio that demand from customers was there but there was a lack of major movies being released for them to watch. \u201cOur problem right now is we have no movies, and this was a big blow for us.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re likely going to make it through; I\u2019m concerned about the independents and the small regional operators right now that are going to really struggle and when they close they may not reopen,\u201d Richards said. Disney said on Sept. 23 it had postponed the release of superhero movie \u201cBlack Widow\u201d and director Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cWest Side Story\u201d until 2021. The next significant release is Pixar\u2019s \u201cSoul,\u201d set for Nov. 20. However, a report in Variety suggested that this could instead be moved to Disney+, the streaming services owned by Walt Disney DIS. Cineworld\u2019s announcement will increase pressure on the government for more support for the entertainment and arts industry, which still has 51% of workers on furlough. Around 51% of the industry\u2019s workforce were still on furlough as part of the government\u2019s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme between July 27 and Aug. 9, according to the Office for National Statistics. In September, Cineworld reported a $1.6 billion pretax loss for the first six months of the year, during which its net bet increased to $8.2 billion. The company said it is assessing several sources of additional liquidity and all liquidity raising options are being considered. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets. com, said the delay to the next James Bond film was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back, but Cineworld was a little bloated before the pandemic struck. \u201cNet debt of over $8bn \u2014 thanks mainly to two large leveraged acquisitions in recent years \u2014 and a market cap of $540m by the close on Friday left Cineworld in a difficult position to refinance if punters were not coming through the doors; without the Bond franchise to draw people in there was little option \u2014 closing its theaters at least gives it a chance to preserve cash and wait for things to improve,\u201d Wilson said. Read: Here\u2019s everything coming to Netflix in October 2020 \u2014 and what\u2019s leaving He added that refinancing by some sort of rights issue seems inevitable. \u201cThe advance of over-the-top streaming services, especially Netflix NFLX, +1.43% with its vast Hollywood budgets and ability to make feature films, has been a critical blow to the industry and COVID has vastly compounded the problem by keeping viewers away.\u201d"}]}
