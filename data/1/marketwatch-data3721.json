The analysts expect that the company's U.S. digital ad revenues will drop to $39.58 billion from $41.8 billion in 2020, giving Google 29.4% of the online U.S. advertising market. The company had an estimated 31.6% share in 2019, the analysts said. They still see room for growth from Facebook Inc. FB, +0.26% and Amazon.com Inc., projecting that Facebook's U.S. digital ad revenue will climb to $31.43 billion from $29.95 billion while Amazon's will increase to $12.75 billion from $10.32 billion. That would leave Facebook with an estimated 23.4% share of the market, up from 22.7% in 2019, and leave Amazon with an estimated 9.5% share, up from 7.8%. Alphabet shares have added 35% over the past three months, while Facebook's have risen 60% and Amazon's have climbed 46%. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% is up 35% in that time."}]}
