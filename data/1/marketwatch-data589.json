Trump was making visits to two key swing states on Tuesday, giving a speech in Florida in the afternoon and an address in North Carolina in the evening. Trump has discussed spending as much as $100 million of his own money on his re-election campaign, if necessary, according to a Bloomberg News report on Tuesday citing unnamed sources. He contributed $66 million to his 2016 campaign, but it would be unprecedented for an incumbent president to put his own money toward winning a second term, the report added. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign and its affiliates last week announced they raised $364.5 million in August, breaking the previous monthly fundraising record for a White House campaign.
