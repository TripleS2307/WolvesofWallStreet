Historically, financial advisers would tell their clients to keep 60% of their cash in stocks and the rest in highly rated bonds, with the idea that the portfolio would capture the dramatic long-term gains achieved by equities, while depending on the \u201csafe\u201d fixed-income assets like government bonds to rally during any short-term drawdowns in the stock market. Yet money managers and bank strategists have repeatedly questioned the ability of government bonds and mortgage-backed debt to act as ballast in a portfolio, with yields on such \u201csafe\" assets looking increasingly meager. \u201cIn the zero-yield world, which we think will be with us for years, bonds offer neither much return nor protection against equity falls,\u201d said Jan Loeys and Shiny Kundu, strategists at JP Morgan, in a Tuesday note.

So far, the traditional allocation has performed admirably in the last four to five decades, returning around 10% annually over that stretch. And a 60/40 fund would have helped offset losses this year, too. Vanguard\u2019s balanced index fund VBINX, +0.52% eked a gain of less than 1% year-to-date through June 30. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% is down 3.3% over the same period. Yet as long-term Treasury yields hover near historic lows, investors say it\u2019s hard to imagine how much further government bonds and other \u201csafe\u201d fixed-income assets can rally. At the moment, the 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.777% stands at 0.68%, while the yield for the U.S. Aggregate Bond Index AGG, +0.02% , comprised of government debt, mortgage-backed debt and highly rated corporate bonds, offers a yield of 1.3%, a historic low. Bond prices move in the opposite direction of yields. Unless long-term yields turn negative, the ability of plain-vanilla bonds to offset drawdowns in the risky asset share of the portfolio could prove limited. Moreover, in the event that inflation materializes or the Federal Reserve raises rates, investors holding long-term government paper could feel painful losses. \u201cWith yields so low, bonds can no longer do all the things they\u2019ve been doing for investors during this secular declining interest rate environment over the last forty years,\u201d said David Jilek, chief investment strategist at Gateway Investment Advisers. JP Morgan forecast annual returns for a 60/40 portfolio would average around 3.5% over the next decade.

By their estimation, a portfolio allocating 20% to bonds, 40% to hybrids, and 40% to stocks could offer an additional 50 basis points of returns over the traditional 60/40 portfolio. \u201cThis may not sound like a huge difference, but this adds up over the years,\u201d JP Morgan said."}]}
