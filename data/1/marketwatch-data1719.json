United UAL, +0.32% has required face masks for passengers since May 4, but on Monday, the airline said that starting June 18, those who don\u2019t comply with the rules will be placed on \u201can internal travel restriction list,\u201d losing \u201ctheir travel privileges on United for a duration of time to be determined pending a comprehensive incident review.\u201d In a statement, United said flight attendants will first explain the policy and ask scofflaws to put on their mask, or offer them one. If they don\u2019t comply, \u201cflight attendants will do their best to de-escalate the situation\u201d and give them a written \u201cpolicy reminder card.\u201d If they still don\u2019t comply, \u201cthe flight attendant will file a report of the incident, which will initiate a formal review process.\u201d Don\u2019t expect air marshals to drag out offending passengers \u2014 no physical action will be taken onboard. \u201cAny final decision or actions regarding a customer\u2019s future flight benefits will not occur onboard but instead take place after the flight has reached its destination and the security team has investigated the incident,\u201d United said. Exceptions will be made for passengers with medical conditions or disabilities that prevent them from wearing a mask, and passengers may remove their masks to ea, drink or take medication. United said it expects masks to be mandatory for at least another 60 days. \u201cWearing a mask is a critical part of helping make air travel safer,\u201d Dr. James Merlino, chief clinical transformation officer at Cleveland Clinic, said in a statement. \u201cThe more people in a given space wearing masks, the fewer viral particles are making it into the space around them, decreasing exposure and risk.\u201d \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is an unmistakable signal that we\u2019re prepared to take serious steps, if necessary, to protect our customers and crew,\u201d Toby Enqvist, United\u2019s chief customer officer, said in the statement. The announcement came as the trade group Airlines for America said its member carriers, which include United, Alaska Airlines ALK, +0.15%, American Airlines AAL, +0.34% , Delta Air Lines DAL, +0.39% , Hawaiian Airlines HA, +0.36% , JetBlue Airways JBLU, -0.07% and Southwest Airlines LUV, +1.89% , will be implementing stricter face-mask rules, including possible bans for passengers who don\u2019t follow the rules."}]}
