At an early news conference, Deborah Birx, MD, \u2014 the response coordinator for the White House coronavirus task force \u2014 said she thought that the United States was more likely to attribute a death to COVID-19 than other countries. Her argument was that in some countries, if the virus forced an individual with a pre-existing heart or kidney problem to go to the ICU, his death would be recorded as due to a heart issue or a kidney issue. But in the United States, that death would be recorded as a COVID-19 death. One might think that such an approach, by ignoring the pre-existing conditions, would skew the count of COVID deaths to the high side. On the other hand, some news reports concluded that deaths were undercounted due to lack of testing and inconsistent protocols. One approach to addressing this question could be to look at the total number of \u201cexcess\u201d deaths in 2020 compared with earlier years, with excess deaths defined simply as the change in deaths over the previous year. To get a sense of normal fluctuations in deaths, Figure 1 below shows this change for the period from late March to mid-August for 2016 through 2020. Clearly something unusual happened in 2020. Figure 2 compares the numbers of deaths attributed to COVID-19 for the late March to mid-August period to the total number of excess deaths. The COVID deaths account for only 77% of the total excess deaths over the period. Not all of the difference, however, need be COVID underreporting, since the normal year-to-year increase in deaths from other causes appears to be roughly 20,000. Still even accounting for this normal fluctuation, about 28,000 deaths seem unexplained (212,049 \u2014 164,184 - 20,000). To see where underreporting might be coming from, we repeated the same exercise for each state. Figure 3 shows the states with an average ratio (72-82%) of COVID deaths to total excess deaths, those with a higher ratio (greater than 82%), and those with a lower ratio (less than 72%). The only thing that\u2019s clear is that those states hard hit by the virus \u2013 that is, more than 100 COVID deaths per 100,000 \u2013 seem to have high ratios of COVID to total excess deaths \u2013 Connecticut (115%), Rhode Island (110%), Massachusetts (101%), New Jersey (80%), New York (81%), and Louisiana (77%). (Data on each state are available on the interactive map in Figure 3.) Maybe you can see more of a pattern."}]}
