Not at all, according to experts and the historical record. And that looks even less likely in the wake of the Democratic challenger\u2019s decision not to travel to Milwaukee for the convention, which has become a largely virtual event because of ongoing public health concerns. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence that holding the convention in a city or state has a decisive impact,\u201d said Julia Anzari, a professor of political science at Marquette University, whose campus sits just blocks from the convention site in downtown Milwaukee, in an email to MarketWatch. Even though Biden and other top Democrats won\u2019t be traveling to Milwaukee, Wisconsin\u2019s biggest city still has a role in the proceedings. Democratic Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin and other politicians from the state are slated to deliver their remarks in person at the Wisconsin Center. But Democrats have said they\u2019re limiting in-person attendance \u201cto only those necessary to orchestrate the event,\u201d meaning personnel such as Wisconsin Center staff and convention organizers. Now read:Here\u2019s how to watch the Democratic convention \u2014 plus who\u2019s speaking, and when In the past 20 years, while Democrats and Republicans often have held their marquee quadrennial events in battleground states, their presidential candidates\u2019 ensuing performances in those states have been mixed. President Donald Trump won Ohio in 2016 after the GOP convention was held in Cleveland, and Barack Obama won North Carolina in 2012 and Colorado in 2008 after Charlotte and Denver played hosts to his party\u2019s shindigs. But Hillary Clinton lost Pennsylvania in 2016 after the Democratic convention in Philadelphia; Mitt Romney lost Florida in 2012, when Tampa hosted the Republican convention; and George W. Bush lost Pennsylvania in 2000, when Republican delegates convened in Philadelphia. This mixed record \u201cshouldn\u2019t be surprising, since convention host states tend to be battlegrounds that could go either way,\u201d said Melissa K. Miller, a professor of political science at Bowling Green State University in Ohio. Also see:Michelle Obama rips Trump as \u2018wrong president for our country\u2019 in DNC speech. Miller also said parties choose their convention locations carefully \u201cwith the goal of tipping the state in their favor,\u201d and the Republicans\u2019 Cleveland convention in 2016 \u201cmay have helped generate enthusiasm among Ohio Republicans for the Trump ticket.\u201d This year\u2019s coronavirus backdrop, of course, casts new doubt on the anticipated impact. \u201cIn the absence of the pandemic, a Milwaukee convention would have undoubtedly inspired Wisconsin Democrats to staff phone banks, flood social media, stuff envelopes and go door-to-door on behalf of the Biden campaign and down-ballot Democrats,\u201d said Miller. \u201cThe DNC didn\u2019t foresee a global pandemic that would dictate a stripped down, Zoom-style ZM, +2.89% event with portions of the convention held in cities in other swing states. Any marginal effect that the Milwaukee convention might have had in a normal election year will doubtless be muted,\u201d she said. Trump Today:Trump kicks off trips to 4 battleground states as Democrats open convention. Biden announced on Aug. 5 that he would not be making the trip to Milwaukee to accept the nomination at his party\u2019s convention due to ongoing COVID-19 concerns. \u201cThe decision to have Biden accept the nomination from his home state of Delaware may have made sense COVID-wise, but it will certainly blunt the typical generation of on-the-ground enthusiasm parties count on when they choose a battleground state like Wisconsin as the site of their convention,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThe Democrats had already scaled back the Milwaukee component of the convention so much that an outsized convention \u2018bump\u2019 in Wisconsin probably wasn\u2019t in the cards. Having Biden accept the nomination in Delaware likely assures an outsized bump in Wisconsin won\u2019t transpire,\u201d she said. Milwaukee residents have expressed some frustration with how an event once expected to draw 50,000 people now is largely virtual, resulting in large part from a city order that limits gatherings in public venues to no more than 250 people. \u201cI don\u2019t think there will be anybody in town,\u201d one local restaurant owner told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Now see:Investors face a big risk heading into the election, strategist warns \u2014 and it\u2019s not because Biden might win In a RealClearPolitics average of polls focused on Wisconsin, Biden has an advantage of 6.5 percentage points over Trump, who won the state in 2016. Anzari points to recent Marquette polling that shows the Republican incumbent struggling when it comes to some key issues for Wisconsinites. Trump has amassed disapproval ratings above 50% in areas such as his handling of protests over police killings of Black Americans and his approach to the coronavirus crisis. Democrats hope their candidate maintains his edge over the president in Wisconsin, and that even the drastically downsized convention in Milwaukee gives their side a boost in the Badger State. \u201cThe choice of a convention site in a given state is a clear sign that the party places a high priority on its Electoral College votes,\u201d Miller said.
