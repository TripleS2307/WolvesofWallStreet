The first is COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus that has infected more than 3.36 million Americans and caused the deaths of 135,616, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. The second: political leaders and others trying to undermine the CDC. \u201c \u2018Trying to fight this pandemic while subverting scientific expertise is like fighting blindfolded.\u2019 \u201d In an op-ed in the Washington Post, the four \u2014 Tom Frieden, Jeffrey Koplan, David Satcher and Richard Besser \u2014 who among them led the CDC over a period of more than 15 years encompassing both Republican and Democratic administrations, wrote that they cannot recall a single time in the past when political pressure had actually led to a change in the interpretation of scientific evidence. Yet that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening in the current administration as President Donald Trump has undercut guidelines devised by the CDC on safely reopening schools immediately after they were released, said the op-ed. \u201cThrough last week, and into Monday, the administration continued to cast public doubt on the agency\u2019s recommendations and role in informing and guiding the nation\u2019s pandemic response,\u201d the health experts wrote. \u201cOn Sunday, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos characterized the CDC guidelines as an impediment to reopening schools quickly rather than what they are: the path to doing so safely. The only valid reason to change released guidelines is new information and new science \u2014 not politics.\u201d Coronavirus update:Global cases of COVID-19 climb above 13 million as California, Hong Kong and India reimpose restrictions on movement The CDC guidelines aim not just to protect children, but also the many adults in their orbit, from parents to teachers to school staffers and their families. Failing to comply with those guidelines will put many lives at risk, according to the op-ed, while also introducing \u201cchaos and uncertainty.\u201d \u201c \u2018In fact, the U.S. has more cases and deaths than any other country, and the sixth highest rate of any large country in the world. The U.S. is home to a quarter of the world\u2019s confirmed COVID-19 cases, despite accounting for just 4.4% of the global population.\u2019 \u201d The CDC houses many experts who have worked for decades to contain other deadly pathogens, including HIV, Zika and Ebola.

Those include two Wisconsin state health department officials, one of whom was asked to resign in the middle of the outbreak without being offered any reason. \u201cThis is unconscionable and dangerous,\u201d the group wrote. The undermining of the country\u2019s premier public health agency has led to a rise in infections and deaths as the public refuse to comply with measures like social distancing and wearing face masks in public spaces. The tragedy is compounded by the disproportionate impact the virus is having on communities of color and lower-income essential workers, they wrote.

The U.S. is home to a quarter of the world\u2019s confirmed COVID-19 cases, despite accounting for just 4.4% of the global population. \u201cSadly, we are not even close to having the virus under control. Quite the opposite, in fact,\u201d they wrote. Read: Why do so many Americans refuse to wear face masks? Politics is part of it \u2014 but only part The op-ed comes a day after New York Gov.
