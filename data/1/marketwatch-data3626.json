Here's where they are", "body": "Retailers and restaurants suffered massive job losses at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic earlier this year, and not surprisingly they have brought the most workers back in the early stages of the U.S. recovery. Yet less than half of the people who were laid off or furloughed have returned to their jobs. The economy shed a record 22.2 million jobs in March and April after large swaths of the U.S. were shut down to curb the spread of Covid-19, according the Labor Department's survey of business establishments. The survey is considered the most accurate measure of U.S. employment. Yet even after another sizable increase in employment in July, the U.S. has only recouped 9.3 million jobs so far. That's just 42% of the jobs lost. Read:Consumers hold the key to an economic recovery and right now they're very anxious On Friday, the government said U.S. employment rose by 1.8 million in July, a touch above Wall Street's DJIA, +0.56%  expectations. The increase marked a sharp slowdown, however, from gains of 4.79 million in June and 2.73 million in May.

Since then they've rehired 3.44 million people. Retailers, for their part, slashed employment by 2.38 million in March and April. They've now brought back 1.47 million workers, retracing 62% of the jobs lost early on. One big caveat: Many retailers and restaurants were paid by the federal government to keep employees on the payroll even if they weren't working. It's unclear how many of the jobs restored reflect employees being paid but not working under the Pandemic Protection Program passed by Congress. In a worst-case scenario, many of those employees could also be cut loose for good if Congress doesn't extend the emergency-loan program or businesses decide not enough customers will return. The latest coronavirus outbreak spurred some states to bar indoor dining, restrict the number of customers in stores or delay reopening plans - actions to which retailers and restaurants are especially vulnerable.

The laggards? Hotels, government and certain business and professional jobs, mainly administrative and back-office work."}]}
