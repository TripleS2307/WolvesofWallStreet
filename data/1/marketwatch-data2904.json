Scott Olson/Getty Images The gloomy mixture of COVID-19 fears and political uncertainty are on investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 minds early on Tuesday.

In our call of the day, Goldman Sachs GS, -0.21% strategists said they remained \u00e2\u0080\u0098pro-risk\u00e2\u0080\u0099 but warned risky assets may be stuck in a \u00e2\u0080\u0098fat and flat range\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2 unless election uncertainty eased.\u00c2 Markets have generally been \u00e2\u0080\u0098risk off\u00e2\u0080\u0099 over the past week, they said, as COVID-19 cases rise and the likelihood of a vaccine by the first quarter of 2021 has diminished. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile we retain a fairly pro-risk stance in our asset allocation, volatility is likely to remain elevated in the near term \u00e2\u0080\u0094 risk assets might continue to be stuck in a \u00e2\u0080\u0098fat and flat\u00e2\u0080\u0099 range,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the investment bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s portfolio strategy research team wrote in a note late on Monday. The team said it would take more investor optimism around growth for stocks and other risky assets to breakout in a more sustained way. That would \u00e2\u0080\u009clikely require falling uncertainty around the U.S. election and positive vaccine developments,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the strategists, led by Christian Mueller-Glissmann.
