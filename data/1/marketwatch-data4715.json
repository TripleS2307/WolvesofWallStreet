The programs had been set to expire on Sept. 30. \"The three-month extension will facilitate planning by potential facility participants and provide certainty that the facilities will continue to be available to help the economy recover from the COVID-19 pandemic,\" the Fed said in a statement. Set up to keep credit flowing in the aftermath of the market disruption in March, many of the Fed programs haven't seen a lot of interest in recent weeks. Fed officials argued that this was a healthy sign that credit was available from other sources and that it was important that the lending programs were in place in case that financial conditions deteriorated again."}]}
