(AP) \u2014 The conservative-majority Wisconsin Supreme Court on Thursday upheld Republican-authored lame-duck laws that stripped power from the incoming Democratic attorney general just before he took office in 2019. The justices rejected arguments that the laws were unconstitutional, handing another win to Republicans who have scored multiple high-profile victories before the court in recent years.

Tony Evers and Attorney General Josh Kaul, both Democrats, took office. The actions in Wisconsin mirrored Republican moves after losing control of the governors\u2019 offices in Michigan in November 2018 and in North Carolina in 2016. Democrats decried the tactics as brazen attempts to hold onto power after losing elections. The Wisconsin laws curtailed the powers of both the governor and attorney general, but the case decided Thursday dealt primarily with powers taken from Kaul.

Evers echoed that sentiment in a statement of his own, saying Republicans have been working against him \u201cevery chance they get, regardless of the consequences.\u201d Thursday\u2019s ruling involved a case filed by a coalition of labor unions led by the State Employees International Union. The coalition argued that the laws give the legislature power over the attorney general\u2019s office and that this violates the separation of powers doctrine in the state constitution. The laws prohibit Evers from ordering Kaul to withdraw from lawsuits, let legislators intervene in lawsuits using their own attorneys rather than Kaul\u2019s state Department of Justice lawyers, and force Kaul to get permission from the legislature\u2019s Republican-controlled budget committee before settling lawsuits. Republicans designed the laws to prohibit Evers from pulling Wisconsin out of a multistate lawsuit challenging the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and to ensure that they have a say in court if Kaul chooses not to defend GOP-authored laws. Evers still pulled the state out of the multistate lawsuit after a lower judge temporarily blocked the laws, but the restrictions on settlements have proven divisive. Kaul has said settlement discussions are confidential and has refused to share details of cases with the committee, putting tens of millions of dollars in potential settlement revenue in jeopardy. In recent months the committee has signed off on a handful of settlements after the litigants allowed Kaul to share details of the deals, but no formal process exists for how to handle settlements under the laws. The court ruled that the attorney general derives his powers from state statutes, not the constitution, and his role is not a core function of the executive branch. The legislature clearly has an interest in joining lawsuits independently and signing off on settlements because it\u2019s responsible for spending the state\u2019s money, Justice Brian Hagedorn wrote for the majority. \u201cWhile representing the State in litigation is predominately an executive function, it is within those borderlands of shared powers, most notably in cases that implicate an institutional interest of the legislature,\u201d Hagedorn wrote. The legislature\u2019s top Republicans, Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald and Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, hailed the ruling as a victory. \u201cA rogue attorney general can no longer unilaterally settle away laws already on the books,\u201d Fitzgerald said. The court\u2019s two liberal justices, Rebecca Dallet and Ann Walsh Bradley, argued in dissent that the ruling blurs the lines between the executive and legislative branches. \u201cThe power of the purse cannot be understood so broadly as to permit substantial burdens on another branch\u2019s intersecting power,\u201d Dallet wrote. \u201cThe Wisconsin Constitution, like the United States Constitution, does not contemplate an active role for the legislature in executing or in supervising the executive officers charged with executing the laws it enacts.\u201d The unions\u2019 attorneys didn\u2019t immediately respond to messages seeking comment. The decision doesn\u2019t close the door to future legal challenges. Hagedorn wrote that the ruling doesn\u2019t address how the lame-duck laws are specifically applied, leaving open a potential line of attack. For example, a litigant looking to get a case settled with the state could sue if the budget committee simply won\u2019t address the matter, Evers\u2019s attorney, Lester Pines, said. Democrats and liberal groups have been trying to push back against the laws since they were passed but have had little success. Liberal advocacy group One Wisconsin Now persuaded a federal judge in January 2019 to block language in the law that restricted in-person early voting to the two weeks before an election. The League of Women Voters and other groups filed a state lawsuit arguing the laws as a whole were invalid because Republican lawmakers passed them after the legislature\u2019s regular session had ended months earlier. The justices ruled last year that lawmakers can meet whenever they wish. The Supreme Court did deliver a partial win for Evers on Thursday, throwing out some of the rules the legislature put in place that required his administration to rewrite thousands of government \u201cguidance documents\u201d and websites. The law also gave the legislature more power to block rules written by the Evers administration. The court found the rules were overly broad and unconstitutional. Evers had argued that the new requirements to rewrite documents were so extensive it would make it impossible for the executive branch to get information to the public. The court is set to hand down another significant ruling Friday on whether Evers exceeded his authority with four partial budget vetoes he issued last year. That decision could further weaken his ability to rewrite proposals coming out of the Republican-led legislature."}]}
