With everything going on in their lives, they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have time to fact-check falsehoods being spread throughout the internet. And even reasonable people might get scared. And the one thing this president is really, really good at is using fear and confusion and spreading lies to win.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s former first lady\u00c2 Michelle Obama\u00c2 delivering a scathing attack on President Trump in a 24-minute video posted on YouTube GOOG, +1.97% GOOGL, +1.82% on Tuesday morning in which she urged her fellow Americans to vote for Joe Biden \u00e2\u0080\u009clike your lives depend on it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Obama called out Trump for \u00e2\u0080\u009cfailure\u00e2\u0080\u009d on the pandemic as well as for racist fearmongering. She accused him of seeking to \u00e2\u0080\u009cgaslight the American people by acting like this pandemic is not a real threat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d even as she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t directly point to the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s COVID-19 diagnosis. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a parent like me, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re feeling the consequences of this president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s failure to take this pandemic seriously \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 from his constant downplaying of the importance of masks and social distancing \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 to his relentless pressure on schools to open without offering a clear plan or meaningful support to keep students and teachers safe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. The first lady also went after Trump for devoting his life to \u00e2\u0080\u009cenriching himself, his family, and other wealthy people\u00e2\u0080\u009d in contrast to Biden. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe boasts about gains in the stock market SPX, +0.87%, but when you look at the lives of regular folks \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing much to brag about,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.
