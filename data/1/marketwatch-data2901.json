The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, said investigators determined that lines northeast of Geyserville were responsible for igniting the Kincade Fire last October that ripped through a wide swath of Sonoma County. Tinder-dry brush and strong winds combined with warm temperatures and low humidity helped the fire spread at \u201cextreme\u201d rates, the statement said. The agency didn\u2019t release details of the investigation but said the report had been sent to the county district attorney\u2019s office, which will decide whether to file criminal charges. The fire burned 374 homes and other buildings and injured four people before it was doused. Messages to PG&E seeking comment weren\u2019t immediately returned but the utility told regulators last year that its lines were the likely cause of the fire. PG&E PCG, +1.79% is the nation\u2019s largest utility and recently emerged from bankruptcy caused by its roles in several devastating wildfires. Last month, PG&E took the extraordinary step of pleading guilty to 84 felony counts of involuntary manslaughter for a November 2018 wildfire that largely destroyed the city of Paradise. The inferno, known as the Camp Fire, was the deadliest U.S. wildfire in a century."}]}
