Michael Saunders, a member of the BoE's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee, said in a speech that the current state of the labor market was \"very worrying,\" and added that the economy might underperform the already dire forecast of the central bank from last month. He also warned about the risks that Brexit represents for the U.K. economy, with the prospects of a \"thinner trade deal, a less-smooth transition or more persistent Brexit-related uncertainty.\" The BoE's key rate stands at 0.1%, a record low, and the central bank has launched a \u00a3300 billion ($395 billion) asset-buying program to help the economy weather the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic. The BoE's Monetary Policy Committee is scheduled to meet next on September 17."}]}
