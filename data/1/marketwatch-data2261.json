To get this column each market day, click here. Technically speaking, the major U.S. benchmarks are back on offense, rising in the wake of an aggressive September downdraft. Against this backdrop, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have narrowly maintained major support \u2014 S&P 3,328 and Nasdaq 10,840 \u2014 rising from key tests to preserve a bullish intermediate-term bias. Before detailing the U.S. markets\u2019 wider view, the S&P 500\u2019s US:SPX hourly chart highlights the past two weeks. As illustrated, the S&P has narrowly maintained major support. The specific area matches the early-2020 breakout point (3,328) and the 50-day moving average, currently 3,331. The prevailing upturn punctuates a successful retest, preserving a bullish intermediate-term bias. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average US:DJIA has maintained its range bottom. The index registered consecutive session lows last week within one point of support (27,447). Slightly more broadly, the Dow has weathered a shaky test of its breakout point (27.580), an area better illustrated on the daily chart. Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq Composite US:COMP is digesting an 11% plunge from record highs. Two inflection points stand out: The 50-day moving average, currently 10,970. Major support matching the former breakout point (10,840). Last week\u2019s close (10,853) registered slightly atop support, and the index has reclaimed its 50-day moving average with this week\u2019s strong start. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq is digesting its fastest-ever 10%+ pullback from record territory. The September downturn has been underpinned by major support (10,840), detailed repeatedly. Consider that the September closing low (10,847) \u2014 established last Tuesday \u2014 and last week\u2019s close (10,853) registered nominally atop major support. The shaky, but successful, retest preserves a bullish intermediate-term bias. Looking elsewhere, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has survived an extended test of its breakout point (27,580). Recall that the Dow is adjusting to three new components, and Apple\u2019s recent stock split, events that have affected its technical levels on the margin. Delving deeper, the 50-day moving average, currently 27,356, remains an inflection point. The 50-day effectively defined the May, June and late-July lows. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has pulled in as much as 7.7% from its record high. Consider that last week\u2019s closing low (3,331) \u2014 established last Tuesday \u2014 registered slightly atop next support (3,328). The index has maintained this area on a closing basis. Separately, the S&P has briefly tagged its 50-day moving average, currently 3,331, for the first time since April. The bigger picture Collectively, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have survived key technical tests even amid an aggressive September downturn. More directly, the S&P 500 has narrowly maintained major support (3,328) while the Nasdaq Composite has weathered an extended test of its breakout point (10,840). (See the Sept. 8 review.) Last week\u2019s closing lows \u2014 S&P 3,331 and Nasdaq 10,847, both established last Tuesday \u2014 registered nominally atop support to initiate a full-week test. The prevailing rallies from support punctuate successful retests, preserving a bullish intermediate-term bias. Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF has rallied from an extended test of the 50-day moving average. The upturn places its breakdown point (153.39) in play. Monday\u2019s session high (153.43) matched resistance, and a retest remains underway. Similarly, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 ETF has weathered an extended September test of the 50-day moving average. So combined, the small- and mid-caps \u2014 as well as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite \u2014 have at least tagged the 50-day moving average, if not hammered it. The Dow industrials have maintained a posture atop the 50-day. Looking elsewhere, the SPDR Trust S&P 500 has rallied from its 50-day moving average, currently 332.64. To reiterate, overhead inflection points match the former breakout point (338.35) and the 20-day moving average, currently 342.78. Follow-through atop these areas would signal waning selling pressure. Monday\u2019s close (338.46) matched resistance, and the SPY has followed through higher early Tuesday. Placing a finer point on the S&P 500, the index has maintained major support (3,328). To reiterate, last Tuesday\u2019s session low (3,329.25) and Thursday\u2019s low (3,329.27) effectively matched the inflection point. The index briefly undercut support Friday before notching a weekly close (3,341) atop support. Conversely, last week\u2019s high (3,425) closely matches the 20-day moving average, currently 3,429. Follow-through atop this area would strengthen the near-term backdrop, potentially signaling an end to the consolidation phase. More broadly, th S&P has narrowly maintained the 50-day moving average, currently 3,331, a level matching major support (3,328). The index briefly tagged the 50-day moving average Friday \u2014 on an intraday basis \u2014 for the first time since April. Both levels mark headline inflection points \u2014 detailed previously \u2014 and the successful retest preserves a bullish intermediate-term bias. Beyond technical levels, the markets\u2019 response to the Federal Reserve\u2019s mid-week policy statement may add color.

These are radar screen names \u2014 sectors or stocks poised to move in the near term. For the original comments on the stocks below, see The Technical Indicator Library. Drilling down further, the Materials Select Sector SPDR US:XLB is acting well technically. (Yield = 2.1%.) As illustrated, the group has rallied to challenge its record peak (66.33), established Sept. 2. A near-term target projects to the 69.00 area on follow-through. Conversely, the prevailing upturn originates from trendline support and the breakout point (63.10). Slightly more broadly, the ascending 50-day moving average previously defined the trend. The group\u2019s intermediate-term bias remains bullish barring a violation. Looking elsewhere, the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF US:GDX is showing signs of life ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy statement. Technically, the group has edged atop trendline resistance, rising from support matching the breakout point. The upturn opens the path to a potential retest of seven-year highs at the August peak. Conversely, the trendline pivots to support. Delving slightly deeper, the 50-day moving average, currently 41.20, is followed by the September low (39.30). More broadly, the group is well positioned on the five-year chart, asserting a bullish continuation pattern hinged to the massive early-2020 rally. Moving to specific names, American Express Co. US:AXP is a Dow 30 component coming to life. (Yield = 1.6%.) As illustrated, the shares have reclaimed the 200-day moving average, rising from a tight September range. The upturn punctuates consecutive August tests of trendline support. Tactically, the breakout point (104.80) closely matches the 200-day moving average (104.54) and is followed by the former range bottom (102.00). The rally attempt is intact barring a violation. Initially profiled July 13, SunPower Corp. US:SPWR has returned 81.6% and remains well positioned. Late last month, the shares gapped to four-year highs, rising as the company spun off Maxeon Solar Technologies. The subsequent pullback has been flat, fueled by decreased volume, placing the shares 13.6% under the September peak. Tactically, the top of the gap (10.50) is followed by the post-breakout low (9.95). A sustained posture higher signals a firmly-bullish bias. Finally, Agnico Eagle Mines, Ltd. US:AEM is a large-cap Toronto-based gold miner. Technically, the shares have reached nine-year highs, clearing well-defined resistance amid a volume spike. The upturn punctuates an orderly five-week range. A near-term target projects to the 92.00 area. Conversely, the breakout point pivots to support (84.50) and is followed by a near-term floor matching the August gap (81.50). The prevailing uptrend is firmly intact barring a violation.
