Nvidia NVDA, -0.54% \u00c2 reported $1.75 billion in data-center sales in the second quarter Wednesday, more than double last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s total of $655 million and ahead of the average analyst expectation of $1.71 billion. The data-center segment is especially important to investors after Nvidia announced its latest Ampere-architecture-based offering for servers earlier this year. It was also the first full quarter that Nvidia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Mellanox Technologies acquisition, which closed in April, contributed to revenue. On a conference call, Chief Financial Officer Collette Kress said that Mellanox contributed about 14% of total revenue and more than 30% of data-center revenue, and \u00e2\u0080\u009cwas a critical part of several of our major new product introductions this quarter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gaming sales rose more than expected in the second quarter, totaling sales of $1.65 billion after posting revenue of $1.31 billion a year ago. The average Wall Street estimate called for sales of $1.41 billion. It was the first time data-center sales eclipsed gaming sales for the company, though that trend may not last \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Nvidia is expected to announce a new line of Ampere gaming chips at a Sept. 1 event, and expectations for the gaming segment in the third quarter are high. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think this may very well be one of the best gaming seasons ever,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Chief Executive Jensen Huang said on the conference call. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already seeing amazing numbers from our console partner Nintendo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In an interview with MarketWatch after the conference call, Kress said that gaming is expected to surpass data center in the current quarter amid back-to-school and early holiday sales of gaming PCs and Nintendo Co. Ltd.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s NTDOY, -0.10% manufacturing of Switch consoles for the holidays. It could be a close race, however. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGaming is growing faster sequentially than data center in the next quarter. In our second quarter, DC surpassed gaming \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 [but] it will likely be gaming as we move into Q3,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said For the third quarter, Nvidia expects record revenue of $4.31 billion to $4.49 billion, while analysts had forecast sales of $3.97 billion. In addition to a big console ramp-up, Huang said that the COVID-19 pandemic has driven more people to videogames as a source of entertainment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith all that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening around the world, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really unfortunate, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s made gaming the largest entertainment medium in the world,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Huang said on the call. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe thing that people haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t realized about videogames is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just a game itself anymore,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Huang said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re spending time with your friends. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re using it to create, to realize your imaginations. People are using it for broadcast, for sharing ideas and techniques with other people, and then of course it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just an incredibly fun way to spend time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nvidia has rocketed to a record $300 billion-plus valuation this year, easily surpassing former Silicon Valley semiconductor king Intel Corp.
