In an interview livestreamed on Twitter and Facebook with the head of the National Institutes of Health, Francis Collins, Fauci said that unlike Europe, U.S. communities \u00e2\u0080\u009cnever came down to baseline and now are surging back up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d His warning came after the July 4 holiday weekend featured widely shared images of young people partying and drinking without wearing face masks or attempting to socially distance, measures that health experts say are key to containing the spread.

Doctors said graduation parties, gatherings at restaurants that turned into packed parties in violation of the rules, and street protests where people could not maintain social distancing and where not everyone was wearing facial coverings were behind the spike, he said. Fauci said a much hoped for vaccine for COVID-19 may not be the home run people are expecting. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not going to be like a measles vaccine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said in the interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be follow-up in those cases to see if we might need a boost.
