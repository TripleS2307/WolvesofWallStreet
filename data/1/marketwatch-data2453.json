In an interview livestreamed on Twitter and Facebook with the head of the National Institutes of Health, Francis Collins, Fauci said that unlike Europe, U.S. communities \"never came down to baseline and now are surging back up.\" His warning came after the July 4 holiday weekend featured widely shared images of young people partying and drinking without wearing face masks or attempting to socially distance, measures that health experts say are key to containing the spread. While President Donald Trump said over the weekend that 99% of coronavirus cases are \"harmless,\" many states are still reporting climbing and alarming hospitalization rates. Arizona reached 89% capacity for intensive care unit beds on Monday, and other states, including Texas and California were expressing concerns about their hospitals rapidly filling. See:Here's one 'remarkable' difference between COVID-19 and the 1918 Spanish flu In Florida's Miami-Dade Country, Mayor Carlos Gimenez rolled back a reopening plan with an executive order shutting down restaurants and gyms, along with ballrooms, banquet facilities, party venues and short-term rentals. \"We are still tracking the spike in the number of cases involving 18- to 34-year-olds that began in mid-June, which the County's medical experts say was caused by a number of factors, including young people going to congested places - indoors and outside - without taking precautions such as wearing masks and practicing social distancing,\" Gimenez said in the order. Doctors said graduation parties, gatherings at restaurants that turned into packed parties in violation of the rules, and street protests where people could not maintain social distancing and where not everyone was wearing facial coverings were behind the spike, he said. Fauci said a much hoped for vaccine for COVID-19 may not be the home run people are expecting. It's not going to be like a measles vaccine,\" he said in the interview. \"So there's going to be follow-up in those cases to see if we might need a boost. We might need a boost to continue the protection, but right now we do not know how long it lasts.\" Vaccinations for measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, human papillomavirus and even influenza all require boosters to remain effective. The virus has killed 130,751 Americans, the highest death toll in the world.
