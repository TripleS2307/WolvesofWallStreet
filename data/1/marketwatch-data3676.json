August gold GC00, +2.17% US:GCQ20 rose $33.50, or 1.8%, to settle at $1,931 an ounce after trading as high as $1,941.90. The settlement topped the previous record of $1,897.50 from Friday and Monday\u2019s close also topped the previous intraday record of $1,923.70 from Sept. 6, 2011, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Last week, prices rose 4.8%, the biggest weekly percentage climb since the week ended April 9 and some analysts say the never-before-seen level of $2,000 an ounce is within reach. U.S. stocks closed lower on Friday, with the heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39% marking its first back-to-back decline since mid-May. Read: Gold rides to a record, with prospects for $2,000 an ounce stronger than ever \u201c \u2018With concerns about further pandemic-related lockdowns, the U.S. dollar decline, real rates continuing to plummet, and rising U.S.-China tensions, it is the entire list of fundamental drivers to get us there getting delivered up in one package\u2026\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Stephen Innes, AxiCorp \u201cWith concerns about further pandemic-related lockdowns, the U.S. dollar decline, real rates continuing to plummet, and rising U.S.-China tensions, it is the entire list of fundamental drivers to get us there getting delivered up in one package today,\u201d said Stephen Innes, chief global markets strategist at AxiCorp, of that $2,000 level in a note to clients. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, -0.58% slid by nearly 0.9% to 93.64, having lost 3.9% for the month so far. The index trades at the lowest since 2018. \u201cGiven the slumping view toward U.S. economic prospects and ideas that Europe will open a significant macroeconomic edge over the U.S., it is not surprising to see the dollar forge yet another lower low for the move and, in turn, contribute to the upward extension in precious metals prices,\u201d analysts at Zaner Metals wrote in a Monday note. \u201cNot surprisingly, investors also added to the bullish environment with news that Friday saw 1.76 million ounces purchased by gold [exchange-traded funds], with a more astonishing purchase of 9.1 million ounces of silver by silver ETFs,\u201d they said. The gold market \u201ccontinues to get a tremendous amount of bullish press coverage and that is likely to embolden the bull camp further, and is likely to result in an even wider cross section of small investors learning about precious metals ETFs for the first time,\u201d the Zaner Metals analysts said. In Monday dealings, the gold-backed SPDR Gold Trust GLD, +1.81% traded 1.8% higher. \u201cAnother bullish force is a ratcheting up of expectations for U.S. central bank action, as soft U.S. data and the unending infection threat is starting to sink sentiment, and we suspect the [Federal Reserve] is now very keen to cushion against renewed shutdown fears,\u201d analysts at Zaner Metals said. The Federal Open Market Committee will make an announcement on monetary policy on Wednesday. And in China, the U.S. says it has closed its consulate in Chengdu, a move ordered by Beijing after the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston last week. Virus outbreaks and the effect on global economies has also seen investors flocking to gold. While investors have been consumed by concerns about outbreaks across the southern U.S. states, Spain emerged as a fresh worry amid a resurgence of the virus, notably in the northeast region of Catalonia. The U.K. government put Spain back on a list of countries it deemed unsafe for travel and ordered travelers to isolate for 14 days upon return from the popular holiday destination. \u201cThere has been a lot of talk about the $2K hurdle, which has been my long-term target too,\u201d said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at ThinkMarkets, in a market update. \u201cObviously, there is no guarantee gold will get there or indeed stop there, but that target is only [around] $55 away from the overnight high.\u201d Meanwhile, the September silver contract US:SIU20 climbed $1.65, or 7.2%, to settle at $24.501 an ounce\u2014scoring the highest most-active contract settlement since August 2013, according to FactSet data. September copper US:HGU20 edged up 0.2% to $2.8975 a pound. October platinum PLV20, +3.99% added 1.1% to $966.60 an ounce, while September palladium US:PAU20 ended at $2,369.70 an ounce, up 3.3% for the highest finish since March."}]}
