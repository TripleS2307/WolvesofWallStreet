Harvard University announced Monday that all of its courses will be offered online this fall. Princeton University and Rutgers University also both announced Monday that the vast majority of their courses will also be offered remotely. In the past few weeks, Yale University and the University of Massachusetts at Amherst have also said the bulk of their coursework will be offered online. The majority of colleges that have announced their plans \u2014 roughly 60% \u2014 are still planning for an in-person semester, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education, which is tracking college\u2019s plans. But these more recent announcements mark a shift from those made this spring or earlier this summer when many colleges vowed to hold at least some classes in person. Over these past few months, colleges have been trying to balance revenue concerns with safety as they prepare for a fall semester unlike any other. Many schools are heavily reliant on tuition and what\u2019s known as auxiliary revenue \u2014 funds they earn through the dorms, dining and other on-campus facilities \u2014 that could be put in jeopardy with a remote semester. Another factor that could complicate any college\u2019s decision to rely solely on online instruction: Guidance announced Monday by Immigration and Custom Enforcement that international students with certain visa types may not take a fully online courseload and remain in the United States in the fall. Many colleges have also been slow to release their plans, worried that their announcement could push students to attend elsewhere. That\u2019s because many students and families are squeamish about the idea of paying full tuition for a reduced experience. Are you a student or parent making your plans for this fall? We want to hear from you. Email jberman@marketwatch.com In its announcement Monday, Harvard said it would be keeping tuition the same, and for students who live off campus, the school won\u2019t be charging room and board, and is including a $5,000 per semester \u201cCOVID-19 Remote Room and Board\u201d allowance in calculating the financial aid award of recipients who don\u2019t return to campus. Princeton said it would reduce tuition by 10% and pro-rate room and board charges, given that the bulk of students will be leaving campus at Thanksgiving break. \u2018Political cover\u2019 for more colleges Harvard and other elite colleges\u2019 announcements that they would be offering courses largely online gives other colleges \u201cpolitical cover\u201d to also go mostly remote, said Robert Kelchen, a professor who focuses on higher education finance at Seton Hall University. Still, Ivy League and other highly selective colleges are in an enviable position, both in terms of their access to resources and top students that could make a remote semester more difficult to stomach for less-selective schools. \u201cIf a student has gotten into one of these very, very selective schools, they\u2019re not going to give up their place if they have to study online for a semester,\u201d said Catherine Bond Hill, managing director at Ithaka S + R, which consults with universities and nonprofits, and the president emerita of Vassar College. \u201cIt\u2019s much easier for the highly selective schools, which correlate with the better endowed schools, to make those decisions.\u201d These schools also have the resources to invest more in their online teaching capabilities and faculty support to improve the remote learning experience, she added. Elite schools also perhaps have more leeway than other, less-resourced schools to offer some aspect of the in-person campus experience, even with remote classes. Harvard, Princeton, Yale and others are bringing some students back to on-campus housing in staggered arrangements. In Harvard\u2019s case, freshman will be allowed in university housing during the fall semester and seniors will be allowed back in the spring. For one, these schools have the funds necessary to pay for the testing and other safety protocols that are required to bring students back into residence halls, said Kelchen. In addition, these research institutions rely less on the funds they bring in from campus housing than other four-year colleges with less robust resources, he said. The financial room private, well-endowed colleges have to make these choices makes Rutgers\u2019 announcement \u201cthe most consequential of the day,\u201d Kelchen said. \u201cIt\u2019s a large public university system and their finances are still in pretty good shape,\u201d Kelchen said of Rutgers, \u201cbut they\u2019re more like the typical college in that they have to worry significantly about balancing their budget.\u201d As part of its announcement Monday, Rutgers said it would offer \u201cextremely limited\u201d on-campus housing. The school\u2019s budget, approved last month by its Board of Governors, anticipates a more than 40% drop in revenue from auxiliary services than the fiscal year 2020 budget. The school has already implemented a number of measures, including faculty pay cuts, to cope with coronavirus-related losses. At UMass, students will be given the option to return to campus housing, even though the bulk of coursework will be done online. \u201cSome of these cuts may last for years to come,\u201d Kelchen said of the impact of revenue lost as the result of the pandemic."}]}
