The subpoenas set up a potential showdown between Congress and Attorney General William Barr about whether the prosecutors would be allowed to appear before the committee and what they would be permitted to discuss. The subpoenas were announced Tuesday for Aaron Zelinsky, a career Justice Department prosecutor who worked on cases as part of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, including the case against Trump ally Roger Stone, and John Elias, a career official in the department\u2019s antitrust division. Zelinsky was one of the four lawyers who prosecuted Stone and quit the case after the Justice Department overruled them and said it would take the extraordinary step of lowering the amount of prison time it would seek for the president\u2019s longtime ally and confidant. He currently works in the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Maryland. \u201cThe Attorney General \u2014 who cites his busy schedule as a basis for refusing to appear before the House Judiciary Committee but has made time for multiple television interviews \u2014 may have abdicated his responsibility to Congress, but the brave men and women of our civil service have not,\u201d the committee\u2019s chairman, Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said in a statement. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Nadler said the committee wants to hear from prosecutors and former department officials who \u201cwill speak to the lasting damage the President and the Attorney General have inflicted on the Department of Justice.\u201d He said in a statement that Zelinsky could shed additional light on the circumstances surrounding the Stone case and Elias can speak about \u201cimproperly motivated activity\u201d in the antitrust division. Whether or not line prosecutors can testify about internal department matters without permission remains the subject of legal dispute, though other Trump administration officials who have been subpoenaed by Congress and want to comply with the demands have done so. Barr told the AP last year that the Justice Department would seek to block any attempt by Congress to subpoena members of the special counsel\u2019s team. A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment on the subpoenas. A former official \u2014 Donald Ayer, who served as deputy attorney general under President George H.W. Bush and is a frequent critic of Barr \u2014 is also scheduled to appear before the committee at the June 24 hearing. Stone was convicted in November on all seven counts of an indictment that accused him of lying to Congress, tampering with a witness and obstructing the House investigation into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia to tip the 2016 election. He was the sixth Trump aide or adviser to be convicted on charges brought as part of Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Before his Feb. 20 sentencing, the Justice Department leadership backed away from its initial recommendation just hours after Trump tweeted his displeasure at the recommendation of up to nine years in prison, saying it had been too harsh. Trump\u2019s tweeting led to a brief flare-up between him and Barr. Stone was sentenced to serve more than three years in prison plus two years\u2019 probation and a $20,000 fine. He\u2019s scheduled to report to prison by the end of the month."}]}
