But the risk of a continued pullback toward $1,800 still exists, especially if there is another spike higher in the dollar index,\u201d they said. On Tuesday, December gold GCZ20, +2.17% GOLD, +2.86% rose $20.90, or 1.1%, to settle at $1,903.20 an ounce, after a 0.9% rise on Monday. The metal hasn\u2019t posted consecutive daily gains since a three-day stretch ended Sept. 16, FactSet data show. Prices based on the most-active contract settled at their highest since Sept. 22. The dollar on Tuesday was down 0.4%, as measured by the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, -0.58%, FactSet data show. The index is down 0.8% so far this week, after posting a 1.9% weekly rise on Friday. Last week, gold and silver prices came under pressure due to the mini rally in the greenback, which can make assets priced in the currency relatively more expensive to overseas buyers. Gold enthusiasts and some commodity experts say that gold remains a strong investment in the long term, given persistent concerns about the global economy and monetary policies implemented to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Analysts say that demand from exchange-traded funds, which must buy gold to mimic the performance of the commodity, also have been a key driver of price gains. \u201cFrom a fundamental point of view, despite the recent slowdown of the price, ETF demand remains stellar, while central banks are still printing money in order to mitigate impact of the economic crisis generated by COVID, a scenario that is likely to last for at least all of 2021,\u201d wrote Carlo Alberto De Casa, chief analyst at ActivTrades, in a daily note.
