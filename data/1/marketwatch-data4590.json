X, -1.99% dropped 3.1% in premarket trading Wednesday, after the steel producer's estimate for second-quarter losses was much wider than expectations. The company expects an adjusted loss per share of $3.06, compared with the FactSet per-share loss consensus of $1.73, as a \"significant portion\" of steelmaking operations have been idled during the quarter as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company reiterated its view that it believes the second-quarter will mark the bottom for the years, with demand starting to show improvement in June. Results for the company's flat-rolled business are expected to be \"significantly lower\" than the first quarter as a result of the pandemic, but demand has begun improving. The tubular business remains \"challenged,\" however, with demand for welded and seamless pipe declining significantly, as rig counts continue to decline and oil prices remain low. The stock has rallied 87.6% over the past three months through Tuesday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% has climbed 23.8%."}]}
