Journalists who have gotten advance copies of the book,\u00c2 Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Most Dangerous Man, report that the book contains some nuggets that are sure to attract attention.\u00c2 For example, Mary Trump alleges that her Uncle Donald paid someone to take a college-entrance test, the SAT, for him. She also claims that Donald Trump\u00c2 lasciviously remarked\u00c2 upon her body when she wore a bathing suit at a family gathering.\u00c2 Publication of the book is also an occasion for revisiting bombshell stories we already know about\u00e2\u0080\u0094for instance, the 2018\u00c2 New York Times report\u00c2 alleging that Donald Trump and other family members relied on tax evasion and fraud to\u00c2 avoid paying taxes\u00c2 on hundreds of millions of dollars (Mary Trump has revealed she was a\u00c2 key source\u00c2 for the Times story). Trump critics are of course eager to exploit incendiary revelations that could damage Trump politically. Mary Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s book is certainly not good news for the president, and signals new trouble for his campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0094though perhaps not in the way the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opponents expect. There is no guarantee that any new revelation, no matter how dramatic, will sink Trump. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen him survive enormous scandals, including the\u00c2 Access Hollywood\u00c2 recording, the Mueller report and related prosecutions and incarcerations of Trump associates, extramarital affairs and reported payoffs to two mistresses,\u00c2 impeachment\u00c2 for an attempt to extort electoral assistance from a foreign country, and\u00c2 recent reports\u00c2 that Trump failed to take action after learning of U.S. intelligence concerns that Russia was paying bounties for the murder of American soldiers in Afghanistan.\u00c2 That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say these or other bombshells are irrelevant\u00e2\u0080\u0094they may well have contributed to Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2 deficit in the polls\u00c2 and could do so again with his niece\u00e2\u0080\u0099s book\u00e2\u0080\u0094but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re past a point where we can expect any scandal, no matter how big, to topple his presidency.\u00c2 There is simply\u00c2 no indication that congressional Republicans will abandon Trump, no matter what happens. The real problem for Trump, however, is that the book is yet another distraction for an easily distractible president.\u00c2 The election is now less than four months away. At this point in the 2016 cycle, Trump was successfully beating the drum on the issues that would define the campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0094his promise to build a wall Mexico would pay for, Hillary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s emails, supposedly dangerous immigrants threatening to invade America.\u00c2 The Republican national convention took place July 17-18\u00e2\u0080\u0094in other words, at almost precisely the same stage in the cycle that we stand at now in 2020. No one would call Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2016 campaign well-organized, but he had gotten his preferred themes locked into the narrative by mid-July. People knew what he stood for (the wall, anti-immigrant policies, reworking trade deals) and what he was against ( Hillary Clinton \u00e2\u0080\u0099s supposed corruption, immigrants, Muslims).\u00c2 It was no surprise to hear chants of \u00e2\u0080\u009clock her up\u00e2\u0080\u009d at the July 2016 Republican convention. It followed predictably from the narrative Trump had pounded home, a narrative that\u00c2 dominated media coverage\u00c2 of the campaign. This time around, Trump is having far less luck\u00c2 controlling the narrative. His campaign argues that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2 still time\u00c2 for him to make a move\u00e2\u0080\u0094as he did in 2016. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2 possible, of course. His supporters can point to October 2016, when then-FBI director James Comey \u00e2\u0080\u0099s last-minute announcement about Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s emails\u00c2 likely gave Trump an edge\u00c2 he needed to win the election by a razor-thin margin in three states that decided the Electoral College. The problem for Trump, as he hopes to relive history (much of his 2020 campaign, like the 2016 effort, is built on nostalgia\u00e2\u0080\u0094this time, that includes an effort to relive the 2016 campaign\u00c2 itself), is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s later than he thinks. He was able to benefit from the Comey letter because he had\u00c2 stayed close to Clinton\u00c2 through the summer of 2016\u00e2\u0080\u0094which depended in large part on his ability to control the narrative. So far, 2020 does not look like 2016.\u00c2 For one thing, Joe Biden leads Trump in the polls by\u00c2 significantly more\u00c2 than Clinton did. Another difference from 2016 is that Trump is now the incumbent, and is struggling with\u00c2 multiple crises\u00c2 that dominate headlines and constantly put him on defense.\u00c2 He has had no luck advancing an anti-Biden narrative\u00e2\u0080\u0094remember the\u00c2 Zelensky phone call\u00c2 from last year? Trump had\u00c2 hoped to smear Biden\u00c2 with the same shadowy allegations of corruption that he successfully dumped on Clinton.\u00c2 But the script just hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worked for Trump this time\u00e2\u0080\u0094in part, perhaps, because Trump was caught and impeached, but also because the coronavirus pandemic and resulting\u00c2 economic downturn\u00c2 have dominated headlines. Trump has been so busy trying to convince Americans that the pandemic is\u00c2 no big deal\u00c2 that he hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even found enough time to\u00c2 settle on the right playground insult\u00c2 to use as a nickname for Biden.\u00c2 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clear that Trump would like to use\u00c2 racism as a galvanizing energy\u00c2 for his base\u00e2\u0080\u0094substituting protesters seeking racial justice, Confederate monuments, and the Confederate flag for immigrants and the border wall. But Americans may simply have had enough\u00e2\u0080\u0094similarly\u00c2 racist scare tactics\u00c2 did not work for Trump and Republicans in the\u00c2 2018 midterm\u00c2 elections. There is evidence\u00c2 that the center of gravity on race has shifted away from Trump, leaving his race-baiting tactics so far outside the mainstream that\u00c2 even Sen. Lindsey Graham\u00c2 was forced to seek some distance from the president. There may or may not be more bombshells to come from Mary Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s book. But, from Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perspective, this is beside the point. The mere fact that the book is appearing in news headlines is another distraction that makes it harder for Trump to play offense with the election now less than four months away. With Trump unable to control the narrative as he did in 2016, the election is shaping up as a referendum on the president\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cAmerica or Trump\u00e2\u0080\u009d as a Lincoln Project ad recently put it. Nothing is impossible, and of course the election results aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t guaranteed, but what may be most significant about his niece\u00e2\u0080\u0099s book is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s yet another reminder of how 2020 is different than 2016, and that, for Trump, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s later than he thinks.
