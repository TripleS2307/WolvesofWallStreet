To add an exclamation to his point, Walt Disney Co. DIS, +1.53% later reported that Disney+ attracted 54.5 million paid subscribers in just six months, and may have headed much higher after the triumphant debut of \u201cHamilton\u201d on that service July 3. The runaway success of streaming services during the pandemic leads to the invariable entertainment-tinged question: What does Netflix do for a sequel? How about more record closing stock prices and yet another blockbuster quarter of new subscribers when the company reports second-quarter results on July 16? The stock, currently trading at record prices of almost $550 a share, could soar to $670 based on a blowout quarter, according to Goldman Sachs analysts, whose previous target price was $540. They also expect Netflix to report 12.5 million net subscriber additions in the second quarter. At least one other analyst expects a smashing repeat of the first quarter. Stifel Nicolaus analyst Scott Devitt, one of Netflix\u2019s more bullish analysts on Wall Street, predicts the addition of 10.1 million new paid subscribers in the quarter; analysts polled by FactSet, by comparison, predict 8.22 million \u2014 although that number has climbed in recent days. On Thursday, J.P. Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth lifted his projection to 8.5 million from 7.4 million. Netflix predicted 7.5 million when it reported first-quarter earnings in April.

Of those who watch Netflix more than seven hours a week, 60% said they were willing to pay more in May, compared with 52% in December.

And we\u2019re actually pretty deep into our 2021 slate. We don\u2019t anticipate moving the schedule around much, and certainly not in 2020.\u201d That gives the company quite a head start on its younger rivals in streaming, with other advantages that were already built in. \u201cIts 2020 content release schedule won\u2019t be significantly impacted, it isn\u2019t reliant on sports, live events or advertising. It also doesn\u2019t have to play a delicate balancing act between selling content to legacy partners or putting content on a new streaming service,\u201d eMarketer analyst Eric Haggstrom said. \u201cNetflix will weather this crisis better than almost everyone else in the media industry.\u201dThe financial effects Revenue: Analysts on average expect Netflix to report $6.08 billion in second-quarter revenue, according to FactSet, up slightly from $5.96 billion expected at the end of 2019.
