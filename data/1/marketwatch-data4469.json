The company posted net income of $625.7 million, or $1.02 a share, in the quarter to May 31, up from $570.2 million, or 94 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Adjusted per-share earnings came to $1.10, ahead of the $1.06 FactSet consensus. Sales rose 21% to $5.023 billion from $4.162 billion, also ahead of the $4.985 billion FactSet consensus. \"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on consumer demand across the company's major markets, including driving an unprecedented increase in demand for food at home and a corresponding decrease in away-from-home food demand resulting from efforts to reduce virus transmission,\" said the company. At-home food accounted for about 85% of its pre-pandemic net sales and away-from-home food accounted for 15%. At-home demand in North America drove higher sales of meals, baking ingredients and cereal. The impact was less elevated in Europe and Australia. The pet segment benefited from stocking up, which partially unwound at the end of the quarter. The company is not providing guidance because of the uncertainty caused by the pandemic, but will work to reduce leverage. Shares have gained 15% in the year to date, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% has fallen 4%."}]}
