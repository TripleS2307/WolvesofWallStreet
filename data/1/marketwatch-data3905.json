Yes, investment gains since early 2017 have been completely dominated by Apple AAPL, +1.74% \u00c2 , Microsoft MSFT, +2.48% \u00c2 , Amazon AMZN, +3.01% \u00c2 , Alphabet GOOG, +1.97% \u00c2 and Facebook FB, +0.26% to the point where the broader market, despite some wild fluctuations, has delivered virtually nothing without the upward push of those stocks. For some perspective on how this has played out, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what the Wilshire 5000, a market-capitalization-weighted gauge of all U.S. stocks, has done since January 2017, minus the Giant 5: That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right... nothing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA miserable savings account would have outperformed the overall stock market without the Giant 5,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Richter said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand would have done so without all the horrendous volatility of the two sell-offs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Read:He hates shorting, but this \u00e2\u0080\u0098terrible, gut-wrenching scenario\u00e2\u0080\u0099 has him doing it In contrast, he said the Giant 5 Index has exploded for a gain of 184% over the same time frame, which has led to \u00e2\u0080\u009cbreathtaking\u00e2\u0080\u009d market capitalizations and dominance. But, as Richter explained, this can cut both ways. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a scary thought \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that this entire market has become totally dependent on just five giant stocks with an immense concentration of power that have now come under regulatory scrutiny,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd just as these stocks pulled up the entire market, they can pull down the entire market by their sheer weight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The stock market certainly wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pulled down in Friday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s upbeat trading session, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% surging 369 points to end at 26,075 and the S&P 500 Index SPX, +0.87% adding 33 points to 3,185. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39% banged out a third consecutive record close."}]}
