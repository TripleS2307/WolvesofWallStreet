GoodRx Holdings Inc. followed its prescription for a strong initial public offering, and it didn\u2019t come cheap. The app that helps consumers find cheaper prices on prescription drugs and other medical help raised more than $1 billion in its IPO by pricing shares nearly 18% higher than the top of its stated range Wednesday. GoodRx GDRX, -2.40% shares began trading Wednesday on the Nasdaq and jumped more than 50% from the $33 IPO price, opening at $46 a little after noon Eastern time and riding a late surge to close up 53% at $50.50. GoodRx sold roughly 34.6 million shares at the IPO price, to raise $1.14 billion at a valuation of $12.67 billion. It also sold $100 million in class A stock concurrently to Silver Lake, a private-equity firm that already owns more than 126 million class B supervoting shares of the stock. GoodRx is considered a controlled company because of the big-money investors that hold supervoting shares, which also includes Francisco Partners, Spectrum and Idea Men; combined, those investors will hold more than 90% of the votes in the company. The Santa Monica, Calif., company will receive proceeds from the sale of roughly 23.4 million shares, about $772 million, as well as the private placement, while selling stockholders will receive the rest. Underwriters, led by Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Barclays, have access to an additional 5.2 million shares that would come from the company. Spectrum and Idea Men are selling more than 10 million shares combined in the offering, while employees and directors are also selling some stock in the deal. GoodRx intends to use the proceeds for general corporate purchases, potentially including acquisitions.

The company is known for its app that helps consumers determine the best prices for their prescription drugs, but has also moved into the telehealth field.
