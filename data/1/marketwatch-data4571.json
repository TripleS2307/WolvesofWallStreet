The stock GE, +2.85% took a 4.4% dive to close at three-week low $6.59. That reversed a gain of as much as 1.6% just moments after the open, and a premarket rally of as much as 4.5% minutes after second-quarter results were released. Trading volume swelled to 146.7 million shares, about double full-day average of 73.2 million shares. The selloff marks the biggest one-day, post-earnings decline since it tumbled 8.8% on Oct. 30, 2018, after GE reported third-quarter 2018 results. Back then, the Power business was GE's biggest problem, and Aviation was its darling. In the latest quarter, Power has continued to show improvement and Aviation continued to be the biggest problem, as the grounding of the Boeing Co.'s BA, -0.39%  737 MAX planes and the COVID-19 pandemic weighed heavily. GE shares have tumbled 41% year to date, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56%  has slipped 7%. See also: GE's stock craters to 3-decade low as airline industry outlook darkens. FactSet, MarketWatch On Wednesday, GE reported second-quarter net losses that widened to $2.18 billion, or 26 cents a share, from $61 million, or 1 cent a share, and an adjusted loss of 15 cents a share, which missed the FactSet loss consensus of 10 cents a share. \"Now as we expected, our financial performance declined across the board in the quarter,\" said Chief Executive Larry Culp, according to a FactSet transcript of GE's post-earnings conference call with analysts, as the COVID-19 pandemic took a heavy toll. Meanwhile, what may have given the stock an early lift was that overall revenue fell 24% to $17.75 billion, but beat expectations of $17.01 billion. And free cash flow (FCF) was negative $2.1 billion, which was much better than expectations of negative $3.3 billion. And Chief Executive Larry Culp reiterated his view that FCF would return to positive in 2021. In addition, GE said it was launching a program to sell off its stake in Baker Hughes Co. BKR, -1.34%  over the next three years, and planned to use the proceeds to pay down debt. GE said it owned 377.4 million shares of Baker Hughes, which at current stock prices would be valued at about $5.9 billion. Culp said on the conference call that GE's overall financial performance started to see signs of improvement in June and July. For specifically the Aviation business, however, Culp said the drivers that were really hurting the business in March - airlines conserving cash, not flying the planes they have, limiting maintenance spend and deferring orders - \"are still relevant today.\" \"We're planning for a steep market decline this year, and likely a slow multiyear recovery,\" Culp said. GE Aviation revenue fell 44% to $4.38 in the second quarter, missing the FactSet consensus of $4.62 billion. In comparison, Raytheon Technologies Corp. RTX, -1.46%  reported on Tuesday that sales at its Collins Aerospace business fell 35% to $4.30 billion, above expectations of $3.56 billion, according to FactSet. And Honeywell International Inc. HON, +0.34%  reported on July 24 that aerospace sales dropped 28% to $2.54 billion but beat expectations of $2.41 billion.

Analyst Nigel Coe at Wolfe Research asked on GE's analyst call if that, given the \"very encouraging\" trends in airline departures in recent months, could the second quarter be considered the \"low point\" for Aviation, but Culp couldn't say yes. He said that while the departure trends are encouraging, \"by no means are we suggesting\" things will get easier. \"I think this is going to continue to be a challenging environment, as governments and the public sort through how to react just broadly to the case trends,\" Culp said. \"So we'll have to see how this plays out,\" Culp said. Credit Suisse analyst John Walsh then asked that given all the \"puts and takes\" as it relates to cash flow, how will GE get to positive FCF in 2021. Culp said Healthcare is \"well positioned to lead\" the recovery, and the \"turnarounds\" in Power and Renewable Energy are expected to continue. But for Aviation, Culp repeated that he was expecting a \"multiyear recovery.\" When Morgan Stanley's Josh Pokrzywinski followed by asking for a \"cadence element\" to that multiyear recovery, Culp couldn't give a straight answer. He said improved airline departures should help Aviation's services business, but as airlines work through what this means for them, not only in terms of their fleet plans, their own cash preservation efforts and their maintenance programs going forward, the services business will continue to be under pressure. \"I just don't think there is, really, any two ways about it,\" Culp said. \"So despite the improvement in departures and that sequential uplift, I think we're mindful that this is going to be challenging for us in 2020, and that won't be the end of it.\""}]}
