Height\u2019s team also has warned that it could take time to determine the winner of this year\u2019s Senate contests. \u201cEven as investors are beginning to discount the possibility of a period after the election in which presidential winner is not known for weeks, the chances of uncertainty about control of the Senate are rising,\u201d the analysts said in a note on Thursday. Recent gains for U.S. stocks SPX, +0.87% have been pinned in part on investors becoming less concerned about a contested presidential election. Democrats took control of the House of Representatives in the 2018 midterm election and are widely expected to remain in charge there after this November\u2019s voting.
