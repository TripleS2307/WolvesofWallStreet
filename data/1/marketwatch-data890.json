Stocks gave up early gains to turn mixed after a U.S. consumer sentiment index fell to 73.2 in July from 78.1, compared with expectations for a reading of 78.6. \u201cIn short, the index weakened in early July as sentiment soured, no doubt reflecting a surge in virus cases that is once again restricting activity and clouding the outlook, especially as it relates to job prospects,\u201d said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, in a note. \u201cSentiment will likely remain subdued in the absence of a more substantial health response that will result in better virus containment and prevent repeated closures that will cause more permanent damage to the labor market,\u201d she said. The U.S. posted a record of more than 70,000 new coronavirus cases in a single day Friday, the highest reported by any country since the start of the outbreak. The U.S. now has 3.58 million cases, or about a quarter of the global total, and 138,360 deaths.

The White House and lawmakers face increasing pressure to come up with an additional fiscal stimulus plan ahead of the expiration of supplemental unemployment benefits at the end of July. \u201cFurther fiscal stimulus could give the bull market fresh legs, with equities having already priced in the current unprecedented monetary policy support,\u201d said Han Tan, market analyst at FXTM, in a note. Meanwhile, European Union leaders on Friday kicked off a two-day summit aimed at reaching an agreement on a \u20ac750 billion recovery fund.

Permits for newly-built homes rose 2.1% between May and June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.24 million. Housing starts nearly met the consensus forecast of economists polled by MarketWatch for a 1.2 million annual rate while permits fell slightly short of the consensus forecast of 1.3 million. \u201cOne of the ironies of this recession is that the weakest part of the economy in the previous recession \u2014 housing \u2014 is now one of the shining stars in an otherwise challenging year,\u201d said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance.
