Even with stores closed for much of the quarter and sales slowing to a crawl during the coronavirus pandemic, Nike NKE, +0.97% \u00c2 Chief Executive John Donahoe talked about the \u00e2\u0080\u009ccompetitive advantages\u00e2\u0080\u009d the company has, including its brand power, its digital efforts and the Jordan brand. By fiscal 2023, the company now expects to reach 50% penetration, up from an earlier goal of 30%, and the company is currently focused on digital investment. Nike expects revenue in the first half of fiscal 2021 to be lower than previous years, but revenue is forecast to be up in the second half of the year as stores continue to reopen and the digital business grows. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNike\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial strength enables us to stay focused on the long-term, creating even greater competitive advantage in times of dislocation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Matthew Friend, Nike\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief financial officer, on the earnings call, according to a FactSet transcript.
