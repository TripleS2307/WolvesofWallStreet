Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a policy briefing and video address that tourism is the third-largest export sector of the global economy, behind fuels and chemicals, and in 2019 it accounted for 7% of global trade. \u201cIt employs one in every 10 people on Earth and provides livelihoods to hundreds of millions more,\u201d he said. In addition to boosting economies, \u201cit allows people to experience some of the world\u2019s cultural and natural riches and brings people closer to each other, highlighting our common humanity,\u201d he said. But the U.N. chief said that in the first five months of 2020, because of the pandemic, international tourist arrivals decreased by more than half and earnings plummeted. Guterres said this has been a \u201cmajor shock\u201d for richer developed nations \u201cbut for developing countries, it is an emergency, particularly for many small island developing states and African countries.\u201d Tourism for some of those countries represents more than 20% of their GDP, he explained. Sandra Carvao, the U.N. World Tourism Organization\u2019s chief of market intelligence and competitiveness, said the $320 billion in lost exports from January through May is three times what was lost during the year 2009 at the height of the last global financial crisis. And according to the policy briefing, \u201cexport revenues from tourism could fall by $910 billion to $1.2 trillion in 2020\u201d and that \u201ccould reduce global GDP by 1.5% to 2.8%.\u201d In addition to tourism jobs that are at risk, the policy paper said jobs in associated sectors, including food service, that provide employment for 144 million workers worldwide are also at risk. It stressed that small businesses, \u201care particularly vulnerable.\u201d Guterres said tourism \u201cis also a key pillar for the conservation of natural and cultural heritage.\u201d According to the briefing, some 7% of world tourism relates to wildlife, \u201ca segment growing by 3% annually.\u201d \u201cThe fall in revenues has led to increased poaching and habitat destruction in and around protected areas,\u201d the secretary-general said, \u201cand the closure of many World Heritage sites has deprived communities of vital livelihoods.\u201d Guterres called for the tourism sector to be rebuilt in a way that is safe for host communities, workers and travelers, and is also \u201cequitable and climate friendly.\u201d Noting that travel restrictions and border closures still remain though some have been lifted, Carvao said \u201cthe recovery will be very much dependent on the evolution of the pandemic and the economic situation.\u201d \u201cNo country has escaped the impact of COVID on tourism,\u201d she said."}]}
