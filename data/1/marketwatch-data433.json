That could include taking the key interest rate even lower than its current minus 0.5%. - Industrial production in the euro area was up 4.1% in July over the preceding month, but still 7.7% lower than in July, 2019, the latest data from European Union statistical office Eurostat showed. Eurozone inflation was at an annual minus 0.3% in September, far from the ECB's official target of \"below but close to 2%.\" - The ECB's task to boost inflation is made more difficult by the continuous appreciation of the euro this year. The common currency is up 5.5% against the U.S. dollar EURUSD, +0.60%, and more than 7% against the pound EURGBP, -0.26%  since January.

As governments are reaching the limits, both political and financial, of what they can do, either at the national or the EU level, the onus will once again fall on the central bank to do whatever it can to prevent another debilitating recession in the region.
