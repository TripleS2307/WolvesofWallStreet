The Federal Housing Finance Agency house price index rose 0.2% on a monthly basis in April, the housing regulator reported Wednesday. Compared with a year ago, home prices were up 5.5%. Regionally, only two parts of the country experienced a drop in home prices between March and April. The South Atlantic region \u2014 which includes Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, District of Columbia and West Virginia \u2014 saw home prices fall 0.5% on a monthly basis. And home prices dropped 0.2% in New England, which includes Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont. On an annual basis, home prices rose in every part of the country, led by the Mountain region, which includes Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming. There, home prices have increased 6.8% from last year.

Fannie Mae FNMA, +0.73% previously predicted that home prices would continue to edge upward. But a report from Zillow ZG, -0.42% released last week indicated that the downturn in home prices could be delayed and might come in the second half of the year. \u201cThe next question housing will face is whether this growth can continue after demand built up during housing\u2019s brief pause in the pandemic\u2019s early days runs its course,\u201d Zillow senior principal economist Skylar Olsen said in the report. \u201cIt\u2019s likely housing will feel the broader economy\u2019s downturn eventually, though to a mild degree, and home values will fall in the coming months.\u201d Looking to the future, FHFA expects a return to normal, to an extent, for the housing market. \u201cWe expect the normal spring bump in sales was pushed off by the COVID-19 shutdowns and may extend into the summer months as states reopen and real estate sales pick back up,\u201d said Lynn Fisher, deputy director of the division of research and statistics at FHFA. Reopening isn\u2019t without its risks though. Coronavirus cases have surged in some states that have begun reopening, including Florida, Texas and Arizona. \u201cRising infection rates, if they result in closures, could restrict sales activity once again going forward,\u201d Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist for research firm High Frequency Economics, said in a note."}]}
