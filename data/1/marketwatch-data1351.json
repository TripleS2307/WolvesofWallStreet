Bank of America polled 1,054 Americans about their attitudes and shopping habits during coronavirus and found that more than 70% have decided to tackle home improvement projects, with more planned for 2021. \u201cAlthough we expect some near-term deceleration as parts of the population go back to their places of business and spend less time at home, COVID-19 could provide a longer-term benefit for home improvement stocks if it ultimately does cause an increase in housing turnover as our survey may suggest,\u201d analysts led by Elizabeth Suzuki wrote. \u201cA shift into larger existing homes (corresponding to a shift out of cities) and older homes requiring renovation (which most young buyers can more easily afford), could be a multi-year tailwind.\u201d Since younger homeowners are tackling these projects in older homes, analysts also found that spending from millennials outpaced other groups. Read:Lowe\u2019s benefited from delayed DIY projects done during coronavirus lockdowns, while Home Depot saw professional jobs put on hold \u201cThis may be kicking off a wave of renovation activity by a generation that has been relatively slow to enter the housing market,\u201d Bank of America said. This is part of the reason why Lowe\u2019s Cos. Inc. LOW, +1.38% had such a good first-quarter showing, according to analysts. Lowe\u2019s reported earnings and sales that blew past expectations late last month. The majority of Lowe\u2019s customer base, 75% to 80%, are do-it-yourself shoppers compared with rival Home Depot Inc. HD, +0.49% , which counts 55% of the DIY community as its customer base, Bank of America said. \u201cGiven Home Depot\u2019s higher reliance on professional customers, we continue to rate HD as neutral, as the longer-term implications of high unemployment/recession could slow growth in professionally-driven projects,\u201d analysts said. Bank of America rates Lowe\u2019s stock buy. Another company benefiting from the trend is Tractor Supply Co. TSCO, +0.47% , which is getting a boost from what analysts call an \u201curban exodus\u201d and a shift to \u201coutdoor categories.\u201d Analysts note that younger people have more flexibility since they\u2019re more likely to not yet have a family, and may be looking to move from their small living spaces where living under quarantine is more difficult. And:Tractor Supply benefiting from consumer trends like gardening and the move to rural communities, analysts say Tractor Supply stock has soared 69% over the last three months. Other research groups are taking note of the increased home improvement activity, with Stifel raising price targets for both Lowe\u2019s (to $156 from $149) and Home Depot (to $276 from $250) in a note published June 16. Analysts highlighted the 16.6% year-over-year increase in seasonally adjusted spending reported by the U.S. Census Bureau. Stifel rates both Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s stock buy. Instinet raised price targets for the home improvement retailers as well. \u201cWe believe that both Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s are well positioned in the current environment and beyond, as we expect home-related retail trends to stay strong for some time,\u201d wrote analysts led by Michael Baker. Instinet rates both companies buy. Home Depot\u2019s price target was moved up $10 to $266, and Lowe\u2019s price target increased to $146 from $130. Home Depot shares are up 34.3% over the past three months, and Lowe\u2019s has skyrocketed 56% for the period. Other companies are reaping the benefits from the home improvement boom. Scotts Miracle-Gro Inc. SMG, +4.65% announced an upward revision of its guidance for the fiscal year ending September 30, with the company now expecting sales growth of 16% to 18%. Previous guidance was for 6% to 8% growth. \u201cAn unprecedented number of consumers planting and maintaining gardens has led to a nearly 40% increase in consumer purchases of Miracle-Gro branded soils and more than 30% increase in plant food,\u201d said Jim Hagedorn, chief executive of Scotts Miracle-Gro, in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a more than 50% increase in purchases of Ortho outdoor pest control products and nearly 40% increase in indoor products. In fact, with the exception of mulch \u2013 which is gaining ground but still lagging last year due to a lack of retailer promotions \u2013 we have seen strong growth in every category this year.\u201d That stock is up 31% over the past three months. And on Wednesday, Sherwin-Williams Co. SHW, +1.47% raised its second-quarter sales guidance. \u201cSharp increases in domestic do-it-yourself (DIY) paint demand during a period of shelter-in-place initiatives in 2Q 2020 is leading to much better than expected sales results in Sherwin-Williams\u2019 Consumer Brands Group and in the Americas Group businesses,\u201d wrote JPMorgan. Analysts rate Sherwin-Williams stock neutral and raised their price target to $555 from $520. Sherwin-Williams shares have gained 26.2% over the last three months. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% is up 24.1% over that period."}]}
