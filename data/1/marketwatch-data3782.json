Lawmakers want to probe possible government failures to uncover the scandal even as evidence accumulated over the last year. - Wirecard\u2019s former chief executive Markus Braun is in custody on accusations of running a criminal enterprise that defrauded creditors of \u20ac3.2 billion. Braun and other Wirecard executives deny any wrongdoing. The company\u2019s former chief operating officer, Jan Marsalek, has fled Germany and his whereabouts is unknown. - Both finance minister Olaf Scholz and Germany\u2019s top financial regulator, BaFin, have been accused of turning a blind eye to Wirecard\u2019s problems, first reported by the Financial Times in January, 2019, because the company was seen as a German fintech success story. BaFin even originally filed criminal complaints against the journalists who first uncovered the fraud.

Lawmakers notably want to establish why Chancellor Angela Merkel lobbied for Wirecard during a trip to China in September, 2019, even as allegations of dubious accounting had already surfaced. The outlook: The inquiry could prove embarrassing for the two ruling coalition parties, Merkel\u2019s conservative CDU and Scholz\u2019s social-democratic SPD, one year before the general election scheduled in the fall of 2021. But the impact on the political careers of both parties\u2019 leaders won\u2019t be the same: Merkel is retiring next year, whereas Scholz will be running as his party\u2019s candidate for the chancellor job.
