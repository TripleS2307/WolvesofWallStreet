What\u2019s driving the market? Technology-related names surged Wednesday, powered primarily by Tesla Inc., Amazon.com and Netflix, extending a stratospheric run-up for large-cap tech and online-based companies. Shares of Salesforce.com Inc. CRM, +2.21% surged nearly 26%, also helping to underpin appetite for the tech names after the cloud-based customer-relationship-management company announced quarterly results late Tuesday that topped forecasts as its revenues hit $5 billion for the first time. The company also was benefiting from Monday\u2019s announcement by S&P Dow Jones Indices that it would be among a trio of companies to be included in the Dow, effective Monday. The rally for equities comes ahead of a potentially market-moving speech from Powell, who will deliver a webcast address to the annual Jackson Hole gathering of central banks Thursday morning. He\u2019s expected to outline changes to the Fed\u2019s policy framework that would allow inflation to run hotter than in the past, ending the Fed practice of hiking interest rates at the first whiff of rising price pressures. However, it is too soon to know what additional steps the Federal Reserve can take to help the economy continue to recover from the sudden lock down in March and April, said Kansas City Fed President Esther George on Wednesday. Investors may also be looking for clues to the potential for additional action by the Fed in terms of monetary stimulus, particularly if the White House and congressional Democrats remain deadlocked on a new coronavirus aid package, said Charalambos Pissouros, senior market analyst at JFD Group. A falling trend in the number of new coronavirus infections in the U.S. and optimism over prospects for a vaccine and other COVID-19 treatments have been credited with pushing stocks to new highs, but analysts said equities might struggle to extend the rise without fresh impetus. Some fear that investors are nearing a \u201ceuphoria\u201d stage that could herald a near-term pullback. Carlos Diez, founder and CEO of MarketGrader, agreed with that sentiment. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of euphoria around the large cap names and that gives me a little bit of pause about what might happen in the near term,\u201d Diez told MarketWatch. Still, he said, \u201cWe have one of the biggest tailwinds in the history which is the massive, massive monetary stimulus globally. It\u2019s hard to argue against risk assets when there\u2019s so much liquidity sloshing around. Over the next six to nine months I don\u2019t expect a major downturn.\u201d Unlike some market participants, Diez doesn\u2019t think another round of fiscal stimulus is needed \u2014 or priced in. \u201cI think investors are probably starting to worry a little bit about the fiscal situation and what happens after all this is over.\u201d See:The market is tuning out coronavirus, so stocks will head higher until there\u2019s another reason to stop, one analyst says In U.S. economic data, orders for durable goods rose 11.2% in July helped by a 22% surge in automobile demand.
