That would be Season 2 of \"Pen15\" (Sept. 18), the hit original comedy from Maya Erskine and Anna Konkle, who play hilarious and cringe-inducing adolescent versions of themselves. The first season, which debuted way back in February 2019, was nominated for an Emmy for comedy writing. div.youtube { height:0; position:relative; padding-bottom:56.25%; } div.youtube > iframe { position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; } Hulu will also launch another original comedy, \"Woke\" (Sept. 9), starring Lamorne Morris (\"New Girl\") as a Black cartoonist whose life is turned upside down after a run-in with racist cops.

The long-awaited fourth season of Noah Hawley's Emmy-winning crime anthology \"Fargo\" stars Chris Rock and Jason Schwartzman this time around, and will travel back to 1950 to tell a tale about Kansas City mobsters, while Season 11 of \"Archer\" has the animated superspy finally awakening from his coma and returning to work, such as it is. div.youtube { height:0; position:relative; padding-bottom:56.25%; } div.youtube > iframe { position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; } The Walt Disney Co.
