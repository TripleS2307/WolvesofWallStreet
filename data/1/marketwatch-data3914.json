Whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an extreme version of the typical August content drought, or the first effects of pandemic-related production delays (or both), it should be a good month to either catch up on past shows or tighten the belt and save money on subscriptions. As this column has previously mentioned, consumers can take full advantage of cord-cutting by capitalizing on the ability to add and drop streaming services each month, and all it takes is good planning and timing. Remember, a billing cycle starts when you sign up, not necessarily at the beginning of each month. Consumers can also take advantage of deals for free streaming trials, as Disney and Apple in particular focus on building subscriber bases rather than growing revenue (for now, at least). You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re never going to get a better deal than free, and the offers won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t last forever.

The good: Netflix NFLX, +1.43% \u00c2 has dozens of original series, specials and movies coming in August. The bad: Not much of it looks particularly compelling. Sure, there are new seasons of cult favorites such as \u00e2\u0080\u009cLucifer\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Aug. 21), the cop procedural that Netflix rescued after it was canceled by Fox, in which the bored devil solves mysteries with the LAPD, and Brazil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dystopian drama \u00e2\u0080\u009c3%\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Aug. 14), along with a number of solid-looking documentaries, kids\u00e2\u0080\u0099 shows, comedy specials and international series \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Denmark\u00e2\u0080\u0099s post-apocalyptic \u00e2\u0080\u009cRain\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Aug. 6), the baking game show \u00e2\u0080\u009cNailed It! Mexico\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Aug. 7) among others \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but little that screams \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou need to see this.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Read: Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s everything coming to Netflix in August 2020 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leaving But there are, at least, two high-profile debuts that may be worth checking out. One is \u00e2\u0080\u009cProject Power\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Aug. 14), an action movie in which Jamie Foxx and Joseph Gordon-Levitt team up to take down those responsible for a street drug that gives people superpowers for five minutes at a time. It looks intensely stupid, but hey, with good actors, decent flight scenes and nothing in movie theaters, it could scratch that itch for dumb summer blockbusters. div.youtube { height:0; position:relative; padding-bottom:56.25%; } div.youtube > iframe { position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; } The other is the six-part docuseries \u00e2\u0080\u009cImmigration Nation\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Aug. 3), which examines the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s broken immigration system from the inside, with behind-the-scenes looks into how Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents do their jobs. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where it gets interesting: The New York Times has reported that the Trump administration has threatened legal action to stop the series from being aired before the November election and demanded scenes to be cut, after revelations that it shows potentially illegal acts by ICE agents, as well as scenes of them lying to gain access to immigrants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 homes, and mocking those they arrest. At this point in time, one has to believe that if the government doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want the public seeing it, then it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most definitely worth watching. div.youtube { height:0; position:relative; padding-bottom:56.25%; } div.youtube > iframe { position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; } Who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Netflix for? Fans of buzz-worthy original shows and movies. Play, pause or stop? Play. Despite the slim pickings of August, Netflix still has a deep, deep library. Take the opportunity to watch a series or two that you missed when they first came out. (The crime thriller \u00e2\u0080\u009cGiri/Haji,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the old-timey gang drama \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeaky Blinders\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the Western miniseries \u00e2\u0080\u009cGodless\u00e2\u0080\u009d come to mind.)Amazon Prime Video ($12.99 a month) It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a quiet month for Amazon Prime Video too. The best of the new additions looks to be \u00e2\u0080\u009cWorld\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Toughest Race: Eco-Challenge Fiji\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Aug. 14), a made-for TV adventure race spanning 10 episodes and 671 kilometers. Bear Grylls hosts, as 66 teams from around the world race for 11 days across the jungles, mountains and waters of Fiji. Think of it as a mix of \u00e2\u0080\u009cSurvivor\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the old \u00e2\u0080\u009cABC Wide World of Sports\u00e2\u0080\u009d presentations of the Ironman Triathlon. For sports-starved viewers, it could hit that sweet spot of competition, thrills and cheering for the underdog. div.youtube { height:0; position:relative; padding-bottom:56.25%; } div.youtube > iframe { position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; } Read: Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coming to Amazon Prime Video in August 2020 Amazon AMZN, +3.01% \u00c2 will also roll out the teen romance movie \u00e2\u0080\u009cChemical Hearts\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Aug. 21), starring Lili Reinhart and Austin Abrams, and a slate of kids shows and older movies. As with Netflix, this is a good time to dive into the library and discover shows you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve missed.

Who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Amazon Prime Video for? Movie lovers, TV-series fans who value quality over quantity. Play, pause or stop? Play. Not much new, but \u00e2\u0080\u009cEco-Challenge\u00e2\u0080\u009d should be legitimately good, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a deep library to explore.Hulu ($5.99 a month or $11.99 with no ads) Now\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also the time to appreciate Hulu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vast library of older TV shows \u00e2\u0080\u0094 because the cupboard of originals is pretty bare in August. The biggest offering is \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Binge\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Aug. 28), a teen comedy movie starring Vince Vaughn (who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s notably not a teen). It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a parody of \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Purge,\u00e2\u0080\u009d set in a world where fun is banned, except for one day a year where everyone can drink, take drugs and let loose.

TV lovers. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a deep library for those who want older TV series, and next-day streaming for many current network and cable shows Play, pause or stop? Pause and think it over. Even though there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not much new, Hulu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deep library could still be worth it.Disney+ ($6.99 a month) For those of you who picked up a Disney+ subscription in July just to watch \u00e2\u0080\u009cHamilton,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safe to cancel now. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a lot coming in August. But for those whose kids need their Disney DIS, +1.53% \u00c2 fix, there are some family-friendly debuts, most prominently \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe One and Only Ivan\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Aug. 14), the CGI-heavy story of a silverback gorilla who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s taken into captivity and forced to perform at a mall circus, and the friends he makes along the way. Brian Cranston stars as Ivan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s keeper, and Sam Rockwell, Angelina Jolie, Helen Mirren and Danny DeVito do voice work. It looks cute. div.youtube { height:0; position:relative; padding-bottom:56.25%; } div.youtube > iframe { position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; } There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also \u00e2\u0080\u009cHoward\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Aug. 7), a documentary about Oscar-winning lyricist Howard Ashman, new episodes of \u00e2\u0080\u009cMuppets Now\u00e2\u0080\u009d and a new \u00e2\u0080\u009cPhineas and Ferb\u00e2\u0080\u009d movie (Aug. 28). Update: A somewhat late addition, Beyonc\u00c3\u00a9\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cBlack Is King\u00e2\u0080\u009d visual album/feature film is coming to Disney+ on July 31. The project is described as a celebration of Black culture, featuring songs she produced as a companion to 2019\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Lion King\u00e2\u0080\u009d remake. Anything Beyonc\u00c3\u00a9 is always worth paying attention to, and if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anything like her stunning previous visual album, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLemonade,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it should be worth a look. Who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Disney+ for? Families with kids, and hard-core \u00e2\u0080\u009cStar Wars\u00e2\u0080\u009d and Marvel fans. For those not in that group, its library is lacking. Play, pause or stop? Pause. If you have kids, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a no-brainer \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth a subscription. If not, then you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not missing much. HBO Max ($14.99 a month) HBO Max will have some decent additions in August, but its lack of availability to many streaming viewers will continue to be a frustration. The main selling point of HBO Max is, obviously, HBO, which has the lion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s share of new releases. The best of the bunch is likely to be \u00e2\u0080\u009cLovecraft Country\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Aug. 16), the adaptation of the acclaimed novel about a young Black man in Jim Crow-era America who travels cross-country to track down his missing father, facing terrors both human and supernatural. It stars Jonathan Majors, Jurnee Smollett, Michael K. Williams and Courtney B. Vance, and looks to be a timely hit. div.youtube { height:0; position:relative; padding-bottom:56.25%; } div.youtube > iframe { position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; } HBO is also rolling out a new season of its NFL behind-the-scenes docuseries \u00e2\u0080\u009cHard Knocks\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Aug. 11), this time focusing on the Los Angeles Rams and Chargers; the documentary \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Swamp\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Aug. 4), about the corrosive effect of money on Capitol Hill; and a ton of new movies, including Oscar-winner \u00e2\u0080\u009cJojo Rabbit\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Aug 1), six older Batman movies (Aug. 1), the Harley Quinn follow-up \u00e2\u0080\u009cBirds of Prey\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Aug. 18), \u00e2\u0080\u009cRichard Jewell\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Aug. 8) and \u00e2\u0080\u009cQueen and Slim\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Aug. 22).

Rogen is reliably funny and this seems like a solid fish-out-of-water comedy, with a little heart. div.youtube { height:0; position:relative; padding-bottom:56.25%; } div.youtube > iframe { position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; } Who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s HBO Max for? HBO fans and movie lovers. Though oddly enough, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still NOT for Roku or Amazon Fire users, since Max owner AT&T Inc. T, -1.01% \u00c2 has yet to hammer out a deal with the two biggest makers of streaming-TV devices. Play, pause or stop? Stop. If you already get HBO, then by all means explore Max. But the lack of Roku and Amazon compatibility makes it hard to recommend Max for most consumers. Peacock (free basic level, $4.99 a month with ads, or $9.99 a month with no ads) Peacock, the streaming service from Comcast\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CMCSA, -0.99% \u00c2 NBCUniversal, launched in July without most live sports and with much of its original programming delayed by the pandemic. That situation won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change much in August Peacock announced a deal in early July to become the U.S. home to English Premier League soccer, offering more than 175 matches during the 2020-\u00e2\u0080\u009921 season. However, the next Premier League season won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t start until September, so nothing much to see here yet. Read:NBC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Peacock is flying into the streaming wars \u00e2\u0080\u0094 how does it compare to Amazon, Netflix, Disney, Hulu, HBO Max and Apple? As for originals, Peacock is still relying on overseas shows, launching the British comedy series \u00e2\u0080\u009cHitmen\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Aug. 6), starring former \u00e2\u0080\u009cGreat British Bake-Off\u00e2\u0080\u0099 co-hosts Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins, and the Australian dramedy series \u00e2\u0080\u009cFive Bedrooms\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Aug. 13), about five single people who buy a house together. div.youtube { height:0; position:relative; padding-bottom:56.25%; } div.youtube > iframe { position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; } Who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Peacock for? If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a cord-cutter who misses network TV, the free version of Peacock is great. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re eligible for Premium through a Comcast or Cox subscription, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a perfectly fine free addition. Play, pause or stop? Stop. The free version is nice, but the paid tier will be unnecessary for most people, at least for now.CBS All Access ($5.99 a month or $9.99 with no ads) A few months after \u00e2\u0080\u009cStar Trek: Picard,\u00e2\u0080\u009d CBS All Access is once again reaching into the \u00e2\u0080\u009cStar Trek\u00e2\u0080\u009d universe in search of a hit. That would be \u00e2\u0080\u009cStar Trek: Lower Decks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d an animated workplace comedy about the support crew on a Federation starship, far from the escapades of Kirk or Picard. One encouraging sign: It comes from Mike McMahon, the Emmy-winning writer/producer of \u00e2\u0080\u009cRick and Morty\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cSolar Opposites\u00e2\u0080\u009d div.youtube { height:0; position:relative; padding-bottom:56.25%; } div.youtube > iframe { position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; } All Access will also bolster its live-sports lineup, signing a deal in July to be the exclusive U.S. streaming home to the UEFA Champions League and Europa League soccer for the next four years, beginning with the Champions League Round of 16 starting Aug. 7. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all part of ViacomCBS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s VIAC, -2.34% \u00c2 effort to beef up the service, which is expected to relaunch next year. Who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CBS All Access for? Cord-cutters who miss network TV and sports. Play, pause or stop? Stop. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still not enough to justify the price, and for soccer fans, the Champions League final on Aug. 23 will almost certainly air for free on CBS.Apple TV+ ($4.99 a month) Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AAPL, +1.74% \u00c2 streaming service has a pair of August releases, both of which \u00e2\u0080\u0094 like nearly all Apple TV+ shows \u00e2\u0080\u0094 seem perfectly fine, but not particularly must-see TV. The new comedy series \u00e2\u0080\u009cTed Lasso\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Aug. 14) stars Jason Sudeikis as an American college football coach who \u00e2\u0080\u0094 despite knowing nothing about soccer \u00e2\u0080\u0094 gets hired to coach a professional soccer team in England.

With the shallowest library of any other streaming service and only one or two originals a month, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still not worth the admittedly low price.Quibi ($4.99 a month with ads, $7.99 a month with no ads) Yes, Quibi is still a thing.
