See: Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the stock sector you want to be in if the Democrats sweep the November elections One key issue is that the former vice president has been \u00e2\u0080\u009cpulled to the left on health care,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and his public option is \u00e2\u0080\u009clikely to be quite negative for managed care and hospitals amid ongoing pressure from the left wing of the Democratic Party,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they wrote, while also warning about potential challenges for drug makers PJP, +0.30%. The analysts said it would be \u00e2\u0080\u009cna\u00c3\u00afve to think that the public plan option will be put on a level playing field with the commercial market.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne only needs to look to the handful of public-plan bills that have already been introduced,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Monk and Smith said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll the legislation introduced to date would give the public plan substantial market advantages relative to commercial players, such as exemptions from state taxes and reserve requirements, provider price setting authority, coerced provider participation, etc.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Progressive Democrats have been \u00e2\u0080\u009cpretty explicit\u00e2\u0080\u009d about using the public option as a stepping stone on the route to squeezing out private plans and achieving \u00e2\u0080\u009cMedicare for All,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the analysts added.

They said that approach resembles the drug-pricing bill that passed the Democratic-run House last year. Other analysts have said that bill championed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would deliver a \u00e2\u0080\u009cnuclear winter\u00e2\u0080\u009d for the pharmaceutical industry if it were to become law. A \u00e2\u0080\u009cblue sweep\u00e2\u0080\u009d refers to the possibility that Democrats win the White House and take control of the Senate from the Republican Party in this November's elections, while maintaining their grip on the House of Representatives. A range of analysts have said that outcome looks increasingly likely, as President Donald Trump slips in polls in part due to fewer Americans approving of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic.
