Cuomo says President Trump has put politics above public health throughout pandemic", "body": "New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued a scathing critique of President Donald Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic on Monday, saying he has denied the reality of the situation from Day 1: \u201c \u2018He said it doesn\u2019t exist, it\u2019s going to go away, by Easter we\u2019ll be reopened, it\u2019s going to go away like a miracle. It didn\u2019t go away, there was no miracle \u2014 he denied reality.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Andrew Cuomo \u201cThe federal government,\u201d Cuomo said at a press briefing, \u201cis committing gross negligence.\u201d A key factor, according to Cuomo, is that Trump is putting a political agenda over public health policy. \u201cIt\u2019s politically inconvenient in an election year, so he denies it,\u201d he said. \u201cExcept you are jeopardizing public health and losing lives by your denial and political agenda.\u201d Cuomo reminded reporters that Trump made a federal emergency declaration concerning COVID-19 back in March but has since left it to individual states to manage the crisis. \u201cIf you issue a federal emergency, that means it\u2019s a federal emergency, and who is control of a federal emergency? The federal government. That\u2019s why you have the word \u2018federal\u2019 in all those expressions,\u201d he said. Now Trump is \u201cattacking science,\u201d and his own health-care experts, said the governor, referring to Trump\u2019s retweeting on Sunday of two tweets by a former game-show host, Chuck Woolery, who now hosts a conservative podcast. Woolery, best known for his stints on the shows \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d and \u201cLove Connection,\u201d accused the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the media, Democrats, doctors and others of telling \u201coutrageous lies\u201d about the pandemic to damage Trump\u2019s re-election chances. Cuomo, as he spoke, flashed a picture of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the widely respected longtime head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, on whom the White House appears to be seeking to pin blame. Key Words:With resurgence of COVID-19 cases in the U.S., Trump signals rift with Fauci: \u2018He\u2019s made a lot of mistakes\u2019 Don\u2019t miss:Coronavirus update: Global case tally edges toward 13 million, and Florida trounces one-day case record set by California last week \u201cNow he says his own CDC officials are lying about the virus \u2014 his own CDC health officials!\u201d said Cuomo. \u201cTrump\u2019s COVID-19 scandal makes [President Richard] Nixon\u2019s Watergate scandal look innocent.\u201d Nobody died in the Watergate scandal, Cuomo observed. Cuomo issued an emergency health order Monday that will require travelers from states that are seeing spikes in COVID-19 cases to complete a location form before leaving the airport, or face a summons and $2,000 fine. The order will be enforced in every airport in the state, and travelers will have to say where they have come from and where they are going. The move comes after New York ordered travelers from states with high numbers of cases to self-quarantine for 14 days, an order he conceded has not been met with full compliance. Travelers from Georgia have infected New Yorkers in at least one county. \u201cWe can\u2019t be in a situation where we have people coming from other states in the country bringing the virus again,\u201d the governor said. \u201cIt is that simple.\u201d"}]}
