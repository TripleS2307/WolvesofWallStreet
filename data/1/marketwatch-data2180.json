Trump\u2019s executive order said there is \u201ccredible evidence that leads me to believe that ByteDance \u2026 might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.\u201d Trump last week ordered sweeping but vague bans on dealings with the Chinese owners of TikTok and the messaging app WeChat, saying they are a threat to U.S. national security, foreign policy and the economy. It remains unclear what the TikTok orders mean for the app\u2019s 100 million U.S. users, many of them teenagers or young adults who use it to post and watch short-form videos. Trump on Friday also ordered ByteDance to divest itself of \u201cany data obtained or derived\u201d from TikTok users in the U.S. Microsoft MSFT, +2.48% is in talks to buy parts of TikTok. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany defended Trump\u2019s earlier TikTok and WeChat orders Thursday, telling reporters he was exercising his emergency authority under a 1977 law enabling the president to regulate international commerce to address unusual threats. \u201cThe administration is committed to protecting the American people from all cyber threats and these apps collect significant amounts of private data on users,\u201d said McEnany, adding that the Chinese government can access and use such data. TikTok said it spent nearly a year trying to engage in \u201cgood faith\u201d with the U.S. government to address these concerns. \u201cWhat we encountered instead was that the Administration paid no attention to facts, dictated terms of an agreement without going through standard legal processes, and tried to insert itself into negotiations between private businesses,\u201d the company\u2019s statement said."}]}
