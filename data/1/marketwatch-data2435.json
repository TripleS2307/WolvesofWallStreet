The index of consumer confidence rose to 98.1 this month from a revised 85.9 in May, the Conference Board said Tuesday. Economists polled by MarketWatch expected a reading of 90.8 in June. One potentially big caveat: The cutoff date for the survey was June 18, shortly before states such as Texas and Arizona reimposed new restrictions after a fresh outbreak of COVID-19 cases. The level of confidence is also well below precrisis levels after steep declines in March and April. The index had stood near a 20-year high at 132.6 in February before the pandemic shut down swaths of the economy. It fell to as low as 85.7 in April. Read:Fear of the coronavirus did more to keep people at home than lockdowns, study says What happened: An index that gauges how consumers feel about the economy right now rose to 86.2 from 68.4 in May. Another gauge that assesses how Americans view the next six months \u2014 the so-called future expectations index \u2014climbed to 106 from 97.6, just slightly below where it was before the virus spread. The increase suggests consumers believe the virus will be less of a problem by the end of the year. The share of Americans who said jobs were plentiful climbed to 20.8% from 16.5%. The percentage who said jobs were hard to find dropped to 23.8% from 29.2%. Big picture: The rebound in consumer confidence signals that a rebound is under way after what might turn out to be the shortest but deepest recession in American history. Yet the persistence of the virus points to a choppy recovery and a prolonged period of high unemployment. What they are saying? \u201cConsumer confidence partially rebounded in June but remains well below pre-pandemic levels,\u201d said Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at the board. \u201cFaced with an uncertain and uneven path to recovery, and a potential COVID-19 resurgence, it\u2019s too soon to say that consumers have turned the corner and are ready to begin spending at pre-pandemic levels.\u201d \u201cConsumer confidence improved more than expected in June, but the survey may not have picked up much of the impact from rising Covid-19 case counts on sentiment in the latter half of the month,\u201d said economist Andrew Grantham of CIBC Economics. Market reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% fell in early Tuesday trades while the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% and Nasdaq NASD, +1.20% advanced. Stocks were little changed after the report."}]}
