A new version of Mueller's final investigation report with fewer redactions was released Friday, as a result of a transparency campaign by BuzzFeed and the Electronic Privacy Information Center. Portions of the report that have newly been redacted center on longtime Trump associate Roger Stone and his alleged interactions with WikiLeaks, which released information stolen from key Hillary Clinton allies during the campaign. Trump said in his written replies that he did not recall discussing WikiLeaks with Stone, though the Mueller probe found that Trump did have conversations with Stone and others about WikiLeaks, according to the report's new iteration. The House reportedly has continued investigating whether Trump lied to Mueller even after the impeachment of Trump.
