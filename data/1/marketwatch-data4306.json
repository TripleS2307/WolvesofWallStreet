Since the U.K. left the EU formally on January 31, months of talks have failed to produce any compromise on those issues. - Brussels has warned it would legally challenge a U.K. law submitted to Parliament reneging on last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s withdrawal agreement relating to Ireland, if London didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t climb down by the end of September. - U.K. media reported over the weekend that Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who just unveiled last week his \u00e2\u0080\u0098winter economy plan\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to help the economy deal with the second spike of the coronavirus pandemic \u00e2\u0080\u0094 has warned Prime Minister Boris Johnson against the adverse consequences of no trade deal. - EU leaders are scheduled to meet on October 15 to assess the state of the negotiations, with only two weeks left by then to conclude a deal that could be ratified by both sides before the end of the year. Read: From lockdowns to Brexit, the U.K. economy is heading toward a rough winter The outlook: The mood in the Frost and Barnier teams is cautiously optimistic and a compromise may be found on fisheries. But a comprehensive agreement can hardly be reached without a U.K. climbdown on state aid, and Johnson might have trouble selling it to the hard-Brexiteer wing of his Conservative Party. The PM may still decide that he can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be expected to tackle the two major economic shocks of the coronavirus pandemic and Brexit at the same time. But his management of both crises will remain contested within his own party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ranks, and not only by the Labour Party opposition elsewhere. Opinion: The world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s poorest countries may get another freeze on their debt payments. What they really need is debt forgiveness"}]}
