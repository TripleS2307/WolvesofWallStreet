What happens when a world leader tests positive", "body": "U.K. Prime Minister, Boris Johnson was diagnosed with COVID-19 early in the pandemic Leon Neal/Getty Images President Donald Trump is not the first world leader to reveal they have tested positive for coronavirus and he may not be the last.\u00c2 A small number of world leaders have contracted COVID-19, impacting their health and their country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s response to the pandemic to varying degrees. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson was the first, requiring intensive care treatment in April and leaving him out of action for a month. He later revealed doctors were at one point preparing to announce his death and thanked them for saving his life. Despite the later severity of his condition, Johnson reported having only \u00e2\u0080\u009cmild symptoms\u00e2\u0080\u009d when he tested positive and the government initially said his hospitalization was a \u00e2\u0080\u009cprecautionary step.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Johnson has since dismissed claims he will quit in six months due to \u00e2\u0080\u0098COVID fatigue\u00e2\u0080\u0099 as absolute nonsense. Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brush with death seemed to coincide with a shift in public attitudes to the virus, with an international study in May showing Brits feared COVID-19 more than any other country.\u00c2 A YouGov study showed that Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ordeal did not cause a surge in support for the government but that support had risen in the days leading up to the news. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who has been criticized for playing down the virus, tested positive on Jul. 7 after developing symptoms. Following several weeks in quarantine, Bolsonaro tested negative after a fourth test on Jul.25. A few days later Bolsonaro revealed he was taking antibiotics as the infection had left him feeling weak and with \u00e2\u0080\u009cmould\u00e2\u0080\u009d on his lungs. Brazil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leader has since recovered, and despite rising cases and death his approval rating last week was the highest since taking office. Honduran President Juan Orlando Hern\u00c3\u00a1ndez was hospitalized in June after a positive test, before being released 16 days later. On his release he tweeted: \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy commitment with Honduras is stronger than ever. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s get to work! Who said fear?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Although neither contracted the virus, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was forced to self-isolate in March after his wife contracted the virus and German Chancellor Angela Merkel quarantined in March after her doctor was diagnosed. The situation in the U.S., so close to an election and with it being unclear whether Trump has symptoms, is markedly different from that following Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s positive test. However, there may be parallels to be drawn, particularly with Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s early isolation, the impact on his engagements and running of the country, as well as the potential public reaction. David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Rosenberg Research, said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile the messaging out of the White House is that the President is just fine, showing no symptoms and planning to carry out his duties as he quarantines, let me just take you back to what happened [with] Boris Johnson when he began to self-isolate back in early April.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe initial messaging from 10 Downing Street was nothing but cheery. Boris had COVID-19 but the symptoms, the British public were assured, were nothing to fret about,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBoris Johnson\u00c2 timelineMarch 27 The U.K. prime minister tested positive for the virus early on in the pandemic on Mar. 27, along with the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health secretary Matt Hancock, complicating the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s response to the crisis. Johnson, who had met Queen Elizabeth II just over two weeks previously, said he had \u00e2\u0080\u009cmild symptoms\u00e2\u0080\u009d and self-isolated immediately in Downing Street and began working from home. The then-55-year-old continued to lead the country via video calls and regular public video messages.\u00c2 April 5 While many recover quickly from COVID-19, Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s symptoms worsened and he was admitted to a London hospital 10 days after his diagnosis. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who was designated to take over if Johnson became incapacitated, began leading the response from Apr. 6. April 7 The prime minister was moved into intensive care two days later on the advice of his medical team, as well-wishes poured in from world leaders and U.K. politicians. The pound slumped in reaction, as Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health sparked concern across the country. After three days in intensive care, he was moved back into the main hospital wards, before being released on Apr. 12.April 27 One month after announcing his positive test, Johnson returned to work and set about taking control of the crisis and planning the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reopening."}]}
