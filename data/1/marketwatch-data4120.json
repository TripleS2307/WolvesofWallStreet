Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield shares fell on Thursday. frederic j. brown/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images European stocks slumped and U.S. stock futures weakened on Thursday, with traders in Europe getting their first chance to react to the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision and its cautious outlook on the world\u2019s top economy. The Stoxx Europe 600 SXXP, +0.55% lost 0.8%, and the major regional indexes, the German DAX DAX, +0.06%, the French CAC 40 PX1, +0.71% and U.K. FTSE 100 UKX, +0.64%, registered similar declines. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday, after European markets had closed, stated it was planning to hold interest rates at nearly zero until at least 2024, as it also said bond purchases would be done to help foster accommodative market conditions and not just market functioning. Chairman Jerome Powell gave a cautious outlook. \u201cAll in all, the piecemeal changes to the Fed\u2019s communications suggest the Committee is comfortable with current market conditions and with the likely path of recovery. Should conditions worsen, the Fed has left itself some room to strengthen the existing guidance,\u201d said Bill Diviney, senior economist at Dutch bank ABN Amro. \u201cMarkets need some more time to digest the news because the reality is that the Fed\u2019s message wasn\u2019t even close enough to be hawkish,\u201d added Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at AvaTrade. \u201cHowever, if we have learned anything from previous [quantitative easing programs], the market participants become jittery when the Fed starts scaling back from its asset purchase program. On this front, we do not have any clear and defined timeline.\u201d The Bank of England didn\u2019t alter interest rates, as expected, but minutes from the meeting indicated there was a discussion about how it could set negative interest rates if conditions warranted. The minutes also contained a pledge not to hike interest rates until there is \u201cclear evidence\u201d that significant progress was being made eliminating spare capacity and achieving the 2% inflation target \u201csustainably.\u201d The pound GBPUSD, +0.83% fell after the decision.
