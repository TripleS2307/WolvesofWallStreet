That\u2019s why we have the expanded rosters, that\u2019s why we have the pool of additional players. And we think we can keep people safe and continue to play.\u201d iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Four more Marlins players have tested positive for the coronavirus on Tuesday morning. The team is still stranded in Philadelphia. Pitcher Jose Urena was scratched from his scheduled start in Sunday\u2019s game, and catcher Jorge Alfaro went on the injured list Friday.
