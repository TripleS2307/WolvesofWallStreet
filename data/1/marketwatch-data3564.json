AFP via Getty Images Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. warned Wednesday of plans to potentially shut down their operations in California if they are forced to recognize drivers as employees in the state. The two companies are appealing a judge\u2019s ruling requiring drivers to be classified as employees instead of contractors. The judge gave Uber and Lyft 10 days to file an appeal before his order goes into effect. Uber UBER CEO Dara Khosrowshahi warned Wednesday in an interview on MSNBC that the company\u2019s ride-hailing service could shut down in California until November as a result. Khosrowshahi said that it would be \u201cunfortunate,\u201d but what the injunction granted Monday would require would be tough for Uber to pull off quickly. \u201cIf the court doesn\u2019t reconsider, then in California, it\u2019s hard to believe we\u2019ll be able to switch our model to full-time employment quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t go out and hire tens of thousands of people directly overnight.\u201d After announcing earnings Wednesday afternoon, Lyft President John Zimmer said in a conference call that losing an appeal would \u201cforce us to suspend operations in California.\u201d Key to the appeal of this week\u2019s ruling is whether the injunction granted by the judge is mandatory, as the company contends, or prohibitory. If it\u2019s the former, an appeal would automatically trigger a stay; if it\u2019s the latter, they can continue its appeal but would have to comply with the injunction order in the meantime. Tom White, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, said in an interview Wednesday that \u201cinvestors need to prepare for the likelihood that both companies are going to shut down in California.\u201d California makes up 16% of Lyft\u2019s ride-hailing business and 9% of Uber\u2019s rides and delivery gross bookings. Uber\u2019s CEO pointed out that the company doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s likely that it will lose the appeal. If it did, he said Uber would have to go dark until November. That\u2019s when California voters are set to consider Proposition 22, which would exempt Uber, Lyft Inc. LYFT, +2.16% and other gig-economy companies from Assembly Bill 5, a California law that would require them to classify their drivers and delivery workers as employees but promises them some concessions. AB 5, passed in May 2019, is based on a California Supreme Court ruling made more than two years ago that changed the standards for employee classification in the state. The companies are challenging AB 5, which went into effect at the beginning this year, but it could be several months before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco takes up the appeal. Pending that, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra and the city attorneys of San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego sought an immediate injunction to force Uber and Lyft to comply with AB 5, which San Francisco Superior Court Judge Ethan Schulman granted Monday. When reached for comment Wednesday, an Uber spokesman said Khosrowshahi\u2019s comments are in line with a motion for a stay the company filed in court Tuesday, in which it said that a shutdown \u201cwould irreparably harm Uber and all who rely on its Rides app to generate income for them and their families \u2014 particularly in the midst of a pandemic.\u201d Mostafa Maklad, an Uber driver in San Francisco and a Gig Worker Rising leader, on Wednesday called Khosrowshahi\u2019s words a threat \u201cthat won\u2019t work.\u201d \u201cIt will be their loss because San Francisco and Los Angeles are their biggest markets,\u201d he said in an interview. A possible shutdown \u201cwon\u2019t be an easy transition for workers, but we will make it through together,\u201d he added. In an email Wednesday, Khosrowshahi urged drivers to vote for Prop. 22, which Erica Mighetto, an organizer with Rideshare Drivers United, said is \u201cmaking an ask of drivers that will irreparably harm them.\u201d Uber said in its filing that \u201cit would take millions of dollars and months of effort to restructure the Uber Rides business model,\u201d and outlined the steps required, including transforming the Rides app from a platform that \u201cdrivers can choose to use or turn off at their leisure\u201d to \u201ca taxi-like employment system\u201d and building an HR system to onboard employees and track drivers\u2019 hours and wages. Opinion: Uber and Lyft\u2019s \u2018day of reckoning\u2019 is finally here During the injunction hearing last week, Matthew Goldberg, deputy city attorney for the San Francisco City Attorney\u2019s office, argued that Uber and Lyft already have large white-collar workforces and human resources departments. \u201cDefendants have dramatically overstated what would be required\u201d to switch their drivers to employee status, he said. \u201cThese businesses already do many of the things that lawful employers do.\u201d Uber shares fell 1.2% Wednesday, while Lyft shares declined 0.4%. Lyft shares initially moved higher in after-hours trading Wednesday after the company reported smaller quarterly losses than expected, but turned to a decline during the conference call. In a note to clients Monday after the judge\u2019s decision, Deutsche Bank analysts said they did not think a possible short-term shutdown in California would be a big hit financially to Uber because demand continues to be low in the state during the COVID-19 pandemic. Still, they said \u201cit\u2019s obviously not the company\u2019s ideal outcome.\u201d"}]}
