Gavin Newsom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plan to ban sales of new gasoline and diesel-powered passenger cars in the state by 2035, arguing that the mandate is impractical and possibly illegal. In a letter to Newsom on Monday, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said a statewide shift to electric vehicles would strain California\u00e2\u0080\u0099s electric grid. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCalifornia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s record of rolling blackouts \u00e2\u0080\u0094 unprecedented in size and scope \u00e2\u0080\u0094 coupled with recent requests to neighboring states for power begs the question of how you expect to run an electric car fleet that will come with significant increases in electricity demand, when you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even keep the lights on today,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wheeler wrote in the letter. Wheeler also said the order likely wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to be implemented by the California Air Resources Board without approval from the EPA, noting that the Trump administration in 2019 took away California\u00e2\u0080\u0099s power to set its own vehicle tailpipe emissions standards. Newsom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t immediately respond to a request for comment. The governor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s order, which he signed last week, is an ambitious step to bolster electric vehicles and slash greenhouse-gas emissions. The order is aimed at new-car sales and won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t prohibit Californians from owning or selling existing gas-powered cars, Newsom, a Democrat, said last week.
