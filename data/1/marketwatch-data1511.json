The early reading of the consumer-sentiment survey in July fell to 73.2 from 78.1 last month, the University of Michigan said Friday. Final results for July will be released in two weeks. The index has fallen close to a pandemic low, erasing almost all the gains in the prior two months.

California this week shut down large parts of its economy again. An index that measures how consumers feel about the economy right now slid to 84.2 from 87.1. Another part of the survey that looks six months ahead slipped to 66.2 from 72.3. That\u2019s just slightly above April\u2019s 65.9 reading during the height of the pandemic. \u201cUnfortunately, declines are more likely in the months ahead as the coronavirus spreads and causes continued economic harm, social disruptions, and permanent scarring,\u201d said Richard Curtin, the chief economist of the sentiment survey. See:Marketwatch\u2019s Coronavirus Economic Recovery Tracker. Big picture: The influx of new coronavirus cases in California, Texas, Florida and other states threatens to derail a recovery and rob the economy of the momentum it built up in May and June as the U.S. loosened restrictions on businesses and consumers. The expiration of extra federal jobless benefits at the end of July may also be weighing on the minds of consumers. Congress is likely approve more relief measures, but a temporary $600-a-week unemployment benefit might be reduced. While the reopening of New York, New Jersey and other hard-hit states where the virus is slowing will help limit the damage, it may not be enough to prevent the U.S. economy from sinking back into a malaise. The virus has to be brought under control, economists says, before a sustained recovery can take place.

Market reaction:The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% and S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% turned lower in Friday trades after the decline in consumer sentiment."}]}
