There\u2019s \u201cvery little reason to see gold prices move lower in the near future.\u201d August gold US:GCQ20 rose $19.30, or 1.1%, to settle at $1,800.50 an ounce. That was the highest finish for a most-active contract since Sept. 2011, according to Dow Jones Market Data. In August 2011, gold futures settled at a record $1,891.90.

For the quarter, the commodity gained nearly 13% and it climbed almost 3% in the month of June. Meanwhile, September silver US:SIU20 which is the most-active contract, rose 57 cents, or 0.6%, to $18.637 an ounce. For the first six months of the year, the white metal climbed 4%, but has surged nearly 32% over the quarter. It tacked on nearly 0.8% in June. Prices for the precious metals notched fresh intraday highs after New York Fed President John Williams said Tuesday that the economy seems to be on the mend, but remains damaged. \u201cThe economy is still far from healthy and a full recovery will likely take years to achieve,\u201d Williams said. The market also listened to testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Powell and Mnuchin were offering a House Financial Services Committee guidance on the risks to lifting restrictions on commercial activity against keeping the pandemic in check.

The index traded up by around 1% so far this year. A stronger dollar can weigh on precious metals priced in the currency, deflating the appeal of dollar-pegged commodities. Rounding out action on Comex on the day, October platinum PLV20, +3.99% rose 2.8% at $851.20 an ounce, ending down around 13% year to date, while September palladium US:PAU20 added 1.8% to $1,966.90 an ounce, up around 3% so far this year. The most-active September copper contract US:HGU20 added 1.3% to $2.7285 a pound, with prices up roughly 22% for the quarter but down around 2.4% so far this year. \u201cCopper prices are significantly off their lows reached in depths of the coronavirus crisis,\u201d said Klearman, pointing out that they traded down by nearly 30% year to date on March 23. Lockdowns in China and most major economies throughout the world, \u201creduced real and expected demand for copper,\u201d he said. \u201cInterestingly though, lockdowns also adversely affected copper production with a not insignificant number mines shutting down,\u201d said Klearman. \u201cThis reduced copper production counterbalanced reduced demand and helped move prices significantly off their lows.\u201d \u201cWith easing coronavirus restrictions throughout the world, both copper demand and supply should increase,\u201d and infrastructure-related fiscal stimulus programs in the U.S., China and elsewhere \u201ccould help drive demand above levels pre-pandemic levels,\u201d he said."}]}
