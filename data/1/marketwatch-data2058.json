The 200-plus-year-old retailer best known for what would now be considered formal office attire has filed for bankruptcy, falling victim to the COVID-19 outbreak, which has shuttered stores and stymied retail, and changing styles. Brooks Brothers had fallen on rough times even before the pandemic, announcing last year that it would explore its strategic options. It now has a $75 million debtor-in-possession loan and there is interest from a potential buyer, Barneys New York owner Authentic Brands LLC, according to The Wall Street Journal. Watch: How closing this gap could save the global economy $1 trillion Brooks Brothers has tried to inject some freshness and a more laid-back vibe into its fashions, with \u201ccool & casual\u201d styles currently featured on its e-commerce homepage. However, the \u201ccasualization\u201d of the workplace has outpaced the change at the iconic brand. \u201c[W]hen it comes to tastes and style, Brooks Brothers has been swimming against the tide,\u201d wrote Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData Retail. \u201cIts formal, old-school approach found favor among mature and more traditional demographics, but it has become increasingly out of step with a new generation of consumers who are looking for a more edgy approach to smart casual.\u201d Moreover, lockdowns to prevent the spread of coronavirus have made athleisure gear like sweats and yoga pants the items people most want to wear. GlobalData numbers show a 74% decline in year-over-year sales of men\u2019s formal wear during April, May and June. Men\u2019s \u201csmart casual\u201d saw a 62% decrease. Among the issues retailers now face are bloated inventory, pressure in the wholesale channel that could last into next year and soaring COVID-19 infection rates in U.S. states that had begun to reopen, according to Wells Fargo. Analysts say global athletic brands like Nike Inc. NKE, +0.97% and Adidas AG ADS, +1.87% \u201care among the most attractive names in our universe.\u201d Read:Nike\u2019s COVID-19-related sales decline is a bump on the path to long-term growth, analysts say In the long term, Wells Fargo favors the off-price channel, which includes TJX Cos. TJX, -0.18% and Burlington Stores Inc. BURL, +0.22% See:TJX results show shoppers will head back to stores if the price is right, analysts say \u201cWarmer weather is spanning much of the country, allowing consumers to extend their mostly homebound routines to the outdoors, and expanding their apparel needs beyond comfort and above-the-keyboard dressing,\u201d said Maria Rugolo, apparel industry analyst at The NPD Group, in a recent report. Activewear snapped up 28% of apparel dollars spent for the 12 months leading into May 2020, according to NPD data. And before the coronavirus pandemic, nearly half of consumers who worked from home (48%) would wear the same thing for work, working out and on the weekend. Even with the inclusion of more casual items, Brooks Brothers still has a large collection of $1,000 suits and dresses priced $200 to $400 on its website. \u201cWith the current work-from-home situation, many shoppers are now even more relaxed in their attire \u2013 even executives are wearing T-shirts and polos on conference calls,\u201d said Hilding Anderson, head of retail strategy at business consultancy Publicis Sapient. \u201cWe see this as a sustained shift in expectations \u2013 the days of formal attire five days a week \u2013 or even one \u2013 are fading.\u201d Anderson suggests Brooks Brothers needs a transformation, including its merchandise and marketing.
