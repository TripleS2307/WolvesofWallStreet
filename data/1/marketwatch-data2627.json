Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how to fix them.", "body": "The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed glaring deficiencies in the U.S. manufacturing sector\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to provide necessary products\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially amid a crisis. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been five months since the nation declared a national emergency, yet\u00c2 shortages\u00c2 of test kit components, pharmaceuticals, personal protective equipment and\u00c2 other critical medical supplies\u00c2 persist. Globalization is at the heart of the problem. With heavy reliance on global supply chains and foreign producers, the pandemic has interrupted shipping of parts and materials to\u00c2 nearly 75% of U.S. companies. Decades of \u00e2\u0080\u009coffshoring\u00e2\u0080\u009d domestic manufacturing to other countries have led the U.S. to the current crisis. It has seriously damaged the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s industrial base, increased income inequality and caused stagnation in\u00c2 U.S. living standards. How the U.S. responds will determine the long-term health and prosperity of the nation. Opinion: We deserve an economy that provides jobs, public health and a sustainable environment Manufacturing offshored After World War II, U.S. policies promoted more liberal international trade, reducing tariffs and encouraging increasingly\u00c2 globalized manufacturing. The process accelerated during the 1980s, when the production of consumer electronics, vehicle parts, packaged semiconductors and other goods was transferred to Mexico, Taiwan, Malaysia and other low-wage countries. When\u00c2 China opened to foreign investment\u00c2 in 1978, its low-cost manufacturing proved irresistible to many American companies. From 2000 to 2019,\u00c2 U.S. direct investment in manufacturing\u00c2 in China jumped from $7 billion to more than $54 billion. The rising importance of\u00c2 shareholder profits\u00c2 in corporate decisions led companies to claim that the only way to remain competitive was by moving offshore to minimize production costs. In the U.S.,\u00c2 investment shifted\u00c2 from manufacturing to marketing, branding, and research and development. With far fewer factories and factory jobs, the nation moved to a postindustrial \u00e2\u0080\u009cknowledge economy\u00e2\u0080\u009d driven by information technology, software, advanced communication, and cutting-edge basic research. Dani Rodrik: To tackle inequality, help the middle class get back up In our work at the nonprofit\u00c2 MForesight, a technology forecasting project based at the University of Michigan, we address government policy and national manufacturing competitiveness. Our research has confirmed the detrimental effects of these trends\u00c2 on U.S. employment and resilience. For example, the U.S.\u00c2 no longer has sufficient production capacity\u00c2 or the manufacturing know-how to provide essential goods amid this current crisis\u00e2\u0080\u0094from pharmaceutical ingredients to fabrics for personal protective equipment\u00e2\u0080\u0094or to meet critical defense needs. Globalization has eliminated\u00c2 more than 50,000 U.S. factories over the past 20 years\u00c2 along with\u00c2 over 5 million manufacturing jobs. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because a knowledge economy\u00e2\u0080\u0094unlike manufacturing\u00e2\u0080\u0094offers relatively few high-paying positions. New technologies invented in the U.S. are often manufactured abroad and then imported back, contributing to the current\u00c2 $850 billion trade deficit.The larger costs In our view, three widely embraced fallacies have caused U.S. policy makers to favor the knowledge economy over a production economy: Fallacy 1:\u00c2 Research results and inventions are sufficient to create jobs and raise living standards. The U.S. has built a world-leading research base, led by universities and national laboratories, which\u00c2 receives about $150 billion in federal funding each year. Under the current system, many important innovations conceived on American soil are then manufactured offshore, creating tens of millions of factory jobs in other countries\u00e2\u0080\u0094while hurting U.S. manufacturers. These products are then imported back: cellphones, flexible and flat panel displays, rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, solar cells, drones and more. The economic benefits for American workers are\u00c2 minimal at best. Instead of high-wage factory positions, imports create jobs in warehousing, distribution and sales that\u00c2 pay too little to support adequate living standards. Rex Nutting: How Donald Trump hijacked the Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 best issue A national commitment to domestic manufacturing from its R & D investments would generate high-paying jobs and produce valuable technology exports that would reduce the massive U.S. trade deficit. Fallacy 2:\u00c2 Industrial policy is incompatible with American capitalism. Across the globe, a range of\u00c2 industrial policies and government actions\u00c2 foster the development of specific industries, usually in support of strategic national goals. In the past, the United States has intervened to develop strong manufacturing in the aerospace,\u00c2 nuclear power, telecommunications and semiconductor industries, among others. Continued U.S. government support for military priorities is a key reason why aerospace has remained one of the\u00c2 few sectors with a trade surplus. Since the Reagan administration, the U.S. has been reluctant to pursue industrial policies that have brought success to other manufacturing economies, including\u00c2 Germany, the\u00c2 Asian Tigers\u00e2\u0080\u0094Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan\u00e2\u0080\u0094and\u00c2 China. With a smarter industrial policy, the U.S. could become a world leader, for example, in the manufacture of clean-energy products, power storage and electric cars. Fallacy 3:\u00c2 What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good for large corporations is good for the United States. Generally, social interests and corporate\u00c2 interests don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t align\u00e2\u0080\u0094and haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t for more than three decades. U.S. multinationals are in business to make money, with cost-cutting as a go-to strategy. Moving factories to low-wage countries has become a default decision, despite negative impacts on the skilled workforce, suppliers and overall job numbers. It has\u00c2 devastated domestic manufacturing\u00c2 while boosting corporate profits and executive salaries. The cost has been high during this current pandemic:\u00c2 Supply shortages\u00c2 have cost some people their lives.National response needed The pandemic has revealed the urgent need for an effective national response that re-establishes the ability to manufacture everything from small components to complex machines in the U.S. Opinion: 2020 candidates should say how they would reboot the American Dream Policies favoring domestic production of essential products would create a large number of well-paid jobs for skilled, innovative workers that can provide resiliency in a crisis. Identification of and support for critical industries and technologies, financial incentives to build U.S. factories and strict \u00e2\u0080\u009cBuy American\u00e2\u0080\u009d requirements for government purchases are examples of possible strategies. Manufacturing is critical\u00c2 to innovation and job creation. We have recommended how to increase prosperity and\u00c2 regain industrial leadership\u00c2 through manufacturing. Those recommendations include rebuilding domestic supply chains, supporting local production of innovations emerging from U.S. research, creating manufacturing investment funds, and growing domestic engineering and technical talent. Some of these ideas that would aid U.S. manufacturing are gaining traction in Washington, with at least four bills, including the\u00c2 Endless Frontier Act\u00c2 and the\u00c2 American Manufacturing Leadership Act, introduced into the House and Senate. Provisions would bolster domestic manufacturing and competitiveness with increased funding for advanced technology development. They would also provide technical training and apprenticeships to strengthen the workforce and help small and medium-size manufacturers upgrade equipment. If the products created through taxpayer-funded research were manufactured in U.S. factories, both workers and the economy would benefit. Creation of a new federal agency focused on national manufacturing strategies and coordinated implementation would help maintain commitment to a strong manufacturing sector. A Cabinet-level voice and sufficient, sustained funding would ensure that the nation responds effectively to the industrial shortcomings revealed by the current pandemic. With the right steps, the COVID-19 crisis could become a positive tipping point. It could create a stronger, wealthier nation that is better prepared to confront the next crisis, be it medical, military or a natural disaster.
