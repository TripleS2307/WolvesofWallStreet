The consumer price index rose 0.6% for the second month in a row, the government said Wednesday. Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast a 0.4% advance. The cost of living had declined from March through May during the height of the crisis. The increase in consumer prices over the past 12 months, meanwhile, rose to 1% from 0.6% in June. Just seven months ago, at the start of 2020, the yearly pace of inflation had climbed to as high as 2.5%. Another closely watched measure of inflation that strips out food and energy also shot up 0.6% last month. The increase in the core rate was the largest since 1991, but it follows a record decline. The yearly increase in the so-called core rate moved up to 1.6% from 1.2%.

The cost of oil has recovered from multiyear lows earlier in 2020, though prices are still relatively low. Prices for rent, medical care, new and used vehicles, auto insurance, passenger fares, apparel, and wireless phone and Internet service also rose.

Inflation is still running well below the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target. The government in pumping trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of aid into the economy, but only because demand was on the verge of collapsing. Inflation has been famously described as too much money chasing too few goods. Right now there\u2019s simply not enough demand for goods and services either in the U.S. or abroad to stoke a sustained increase in prices.

What they are saying?\u201cAt this point, it appears that the recent pickup in inflation has been more about the retracement from the lows in March and April rather than a telling sign of mounting price pressures,\u201d said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors.
