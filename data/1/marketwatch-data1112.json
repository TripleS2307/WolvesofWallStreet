Late Tuesday, reports suggested that, Trump administration officials and congressional Democratic leaders are working to reach a coronavirus aid bill deal by the end of the week even if the parties still remain far apart on the issues. As lawmakers wrangle over additional pandemic aid, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday said the Trump administration might be able to unilaterally extend the federal moratorium on tenant evictions put in place in March by the CARES Act that expired on July 25. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the prospects of a stimulus package and earnings that have been coming in, for the most part, better than expected,\u201d Peter Cardillo, chief market economist, Spartan Capital told MarketWatch. \u201cSo, the stock market keeps rallying. And of course, the basic powerhouse of this is the generous Fed.\u201d The Federal Reserve has used up only a fraction of its roughly $2 trillion slate of emergency lending facilities to keep liquidity going, letting investors do the rest. The central bank also has vowed to keep up its unlimited Treasury bond buying program, which comes as the U.S. Treasury Department prepares a record sale of bonds and notes next week to help finance the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Read: Treasury ramps up debt issuance across entire U.S. bond market for third quarter Meanwhile, concerns over the coronavirus led Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on Wednesday to decide not to travel later this month to Milwaukee to accept his party\u2019s White House nomination, according to several news reports, underscoring how COVID-19, tallied at 18.5 million cases globally on Wednesday, is pushing more facets of life into the virtual realm. Better-than-expected quarterly results late Tuesday from Dow component and entertainment and theme park giant Walt Disney Co. DIS, +1.53% also helped to fuel bullish sentiment, even though it reported a $3.5 billion loss. The company touted 100 million subscribers on its streaming platforms amid the pandemic and announced that it would be releasing the live-action version of \u201cMulan,\u201d through Disney+ for $29.99, a new approach to that streaming service.

Choppy market action over the previous few trading sessions is a healthy sign, said Andrew Smith, chief investment strategist of Dallas-based Delos Capital Advisors, in an interview. \u201cThe market is sending a very clear signal that it\u2019s trying to rotate into the cyclical economic recovery names.\u201d Smith thinks back-and-forth between pandemic darlings, like Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +3.01% and cyclical recovery stories, will continue for some time. \u201cIt\u2019s a battle between leading economic indicators and lagging ones,\u201d he said.

Payroll provider ADP ADP, +1.93% also said only 167,000 private sector jobs were created in July, a fraction of the consensus estimate for a gain of 1.88 million jobs, according to Econoday, though June was revised up to 4.3 million from 2.4 million. Separately, the trade deficit narrowed 7.5% in July to $50.7 billion. \u201cIn one line: Ouch,\u201d wrote Ian Shepherdson, Pantheon Macroeconomics\u2019 chief economist, after the ADP release. But since the payroll company\u2019s model incorporates lagged official payroll data, he expects Friday\u2019s jobs report to show payrolls up by about 1 million. That still leaves many millions of jobs lost to the pandemic. Five of the top 10 U.S. states with the most dire labor market disruptions during the pandemic are located in the East, according to an Oxford Economics report on Wednesday, which warns \u201clocal labor conditions could suffer renewed deterioration,\u201d without a \u201cbooster shot\u201d from policy makers.
