How\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that working out?", "body": "It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the well-known, but little-discussed, reality of a life in the financial markets: very little business actually takes place on Wall Street, or anywhere in New York for that matter. Even before coronavirus forced the world into an extended office hiatus, much of the financial services industry has been scattered around North America. Between visits to clients on their turf, conferences and marketing events in far-flung corners, and more, a career \u00e2\u0080\u009con The Street\u00e2\u0080\u009d may just as easily have meant \u00e2\u0080\u009con the road.\u00e2\u0080\u009d MarketWatch checked in with a few high-profile financial road warriors to see how they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve handled having to hunker down, their overnight bags gathering dust. We asked what, if any, shifts in the way financial services operate might be here to stay when things get \u00e2\u0080\u009cback to normal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d if there is such a thing. These are not stories of hardship. Those interviewed know they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re lucky to have jobs they can largely carry out on a laptop from anywhere, plus the luxury of time and money to make the most of this particular crisis. Still, all describe a certain dissonance. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a strange turn of events when a million-miler has no plans to go anywhere. The conversations that follow have been edited for length and clarity. David Rosenberg, a long-time economist and strategist for wealth managers including Merrill Lynch and Toronto-based Gluskin Sheff, decided to strike out on his own in 2020. Rosenberg Research launched on Jan. 6; two months later, COVID-19 shuttered the global economy. Rosenberg is often known as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cperma-bear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but as MarketWatch has frequently noted, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not entirely accurate. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s had his bullish moments. Now is not one of them. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThings aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going back to normal for a long, long time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said in early June. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to burst anybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bubble, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be living not just with this situation, but with the consequences for many years. [U.S.] GDP bottomed in 1933, but the Depression didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t end until 1942.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The latest:U.S. states slowly reopen after coronavirus lockdowns \u00e2\u0080\u0094 some now permit visits to nursing homes Rosenberg had expected that his travel schedule would be comparable to his time in previous roles. He was on the road about 25% of the time at Gluskin. As for Merrill, when he commuted back and forth between headquarters in New York and his home in Toronto, he says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI had to list my suitcase as an official residence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d MarketWatch: How often did you used to travel, and what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your best anecdote from your time on the road? David Rosenberg: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m platinum, gold or silver on five different airlines. One time I was flying from Albuquerque to Denver on a small six-seater jet and they couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t land the plane. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what was going on. The guy made the approach at Denver and the next thing I knew he was pulling up. He had to make four attempts. My fingernails are still in that plane. I once sat next to Paul Giamatti going to Montreal when he was filming \u00e2\u0080\u009cBarney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Version\u00e2\u0080\u009d in 2008. I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re both renowned for destroying an industry. You destroyed the merlot industry and I destroyed the asset management industry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d [Rosenberg was known for predicting the subprime mortgage crisis, which eventually did in his employer, Merrill Lynch.] Economist David Rosenberg and his sons. David Rosenberg MarketWatch: What have you had to get used to during the lockdown? Rosenberg: The part of my job that I love is the social interaction \u00e2\u0080\u0094 pressing the flesh \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the thrill of being on stage. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a big change. The replacement of Zoom ZM, +2.89% \u00c2 for the real thing, that has been the biggest change. So much of my business is research and writing and you can do that anywhere. But the non-written interactions, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been the biggest adjustment. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m managing a team now and we had a nice office in downtown Toronto and I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard on them. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nice when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re starting a business to be physically present, especially as a leader. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lesson to be learned here for policymakers, especially in the U.S. and Canada, that dug their heels in for this whole thing: a stitch in time saves nine. The planning and preparation for this pandemic gets a big fat \u00e2\u0080\u009cF\u00e2\u0080\u009d. People are so glib about this, they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t realize that in a situation like this, being ahead of the curve by a week makes a difference. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sad about the lack of political leadership everywhere. \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nice when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re starting a business to be physically present, especially as a leader.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 David Rosenberg, Rosenberg Research MarketWatch: Is there a silver lining? Rosenberg: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m home with my youngest son, Mikey, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 20 and a fourth-year psychology student. He has been my bartender. He makes a mean Manhattan, dark and stormys, whiskey sours, brandy alexanders, margaritas. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been playing a sh-t ton of Monopoly and they kick my ass. My middle son, Jacob, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 24, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDad, I thought you were in finance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cJacob, this isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t finance, this is real estate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But I feel really sad for the young people like my two boys who have had what could have been the best summer of their lives never come to fruition. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not wallowing in self pity, I feel sad for the young people. They are having memories robbed. I feel badly for that. The best-selling John Mauldin meets his readers pre-virus. Mauldin Economics John Mauldin has written his popular macroeconomics newsletter, Thoughts from the Frontline, for two decades, and is a best-selling author of several books about investing. His firm, Mauldin Economics, offers research and resources for all kinds of investors, and runs one of the most sought-after annual conferences in the investing world, with attendees ranging from Jeffrey Gundlach to Ian Bremmer. The Strategic Investment Conference was virtual this year, and Mauldin says he was both pleasantly surprised with its success, yet still convinced that nothing beats the real thing. He had recently relocated from Dallas to Puerto Rico, and while beach life has its perks, he misses getting together with a group of financial fellow travelers to try to solve the problems of the world over dinner. Mauldin has kept up a grueling travel schedule since the early 2000s, starting with years of 100,000 miles and expanding from there. MarketWatch: How often did you travel? John Mauldin: American Airlines AAL, +0.34% \u00c2 called me last week and said, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re now part of this special group, you have 8 million miles. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s their tracking, not mine. But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m used to traveling a lot. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had a few years of 250,000 miles a year. I have traveled to 65 countries, (including) 15 in Africa, all 50 U.S. states and most of the Canadian provinces. I have no scheduled plans to get on a plane, which is kind of weird. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m writing a book and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m doing a lot of video. We do [our Strategic Investment Conference] every year \u00e2\u0080\u0094 last year we had 750 people. This year it was exceptionally large and well-responded-to over a span of 10 days. It was easier to get speakers because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all locked down, and we couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have ever gotten all these people together at a regular conference. But honestly I do miss sitting at meals, being in meetings with friends, and given how much I traveled, that was just a regular part of my life. That I do miss. And I miss my gym. \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098I once went to Cyprus and had dozens of people come to see me including the minister of finance. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been doing this for years and I still find that cool.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 John Mauldin, Mauldin Economics MarketWatch: What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your best work-travel anecdote? Mauldin: People coming up to you, holding up a book in an airport, saying would you autograph my book, or when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re walking around say, Rome, and people walk up wanting to take pictures. Those are kind of cool moments. You meet people that recognize you because your face is on your newsletter that goes out or they see you on TV. People sitting next to you and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re reading your newsletter and you look over and crack a joke, hey, I like that guy. I miss the dinner conversations, six to eight people in a room and you plow into stuff. I once went to Cyprus and had dozens of people come to see me including the minister of finance. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been doing this for years and I still find that cool. MarketWatch: Is there a silver lining? Mauldin: The glass half full is more time to research and read. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m finishing up a book that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been trying to finish for years. [My wife] Shane and I do get more time together and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re like every other entrepreneur in the country, you scramble and try to figure out, okay, that was a curveball, what do I do now?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got good partners and good teammates and so far, so good. But man, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got lots of friends in the restaurant business and I thank God I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not having to deal with some of the stuff they are. I really feel blessed. MarketWatch: When will you feel comfortable getting back on a plane? Mauldin: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve thought about that a lot. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the plane that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the problem. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the airports and the security lines and everything getting to and from the plane. One of the conclusions is that we think that for a period of time \u00e2\u0080\u0094 six months, nine months \u00e2\u0080\u0094 everyone should wear a mask, to make everyone else feel safer. We really do need masks to make other people feel comfortable. John Mousseau before the lockdown, and during John Mousseau John Mousseau is president and CEO of Sarasota, Fla.-based Cumberland Advisors, a fee-based investment advisory firm with about $3 billion in assets. Before the lockdown, Mousseau regularly traveled about one-third of the time. From his home in Sarasota to Cumberland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office is about a two-minute drive, and Mousseau says he felt safer creating a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccommand center\u00e2\u0080\u009d for himself in the office, where he was all alone with multiple computer screens, televisions and phones. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bit rueful about being stuck at home during Lent, however. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s when I try to do something nice for someone every day, you know, just \u00e2\u0080\u0098Can I give you a hand with that?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 That fell by the wayside this year. The sad part is unless you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re wearing a mask, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do in the new normal. To the extent there was any chivalry at all, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to take a big hit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d MarketWatch: What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it been like being homebound? John Mousseau: There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an upside to this: the solitariness isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that bad because I spend most of the day on the phone. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never any isolation. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been good aspects: you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not out doing entertaining, being entertained, not eating donuts that people bring in. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been swimming, working out, and while the gym was closed, I would go home and go on a run. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m down 18 pounds. But I tell you, if I had been working at home, I would have been a Gloomy Gus. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure my marriage would have taken a hit. The sad part is, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen domestic violence and child abuse statistics pick up markedly all over. I have learned just how important communication is. In March and early April, since we weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going anywhere, I was probably doing 10-12 client calls a day, lined up like planes on an airstrip. People wanted to hear from us. What you find out in a panic, you find out a lot from clients who say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I have some money elsewhere,\u00e2\u0080\u009d so we actually wound up with some accounts that way. MarketWatch: What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your best anecdote? Mousseau: A few months after 9/11, we went to Charlotte. We decided to catch an early flight back to Newark and were on standby. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re calling standby passengers and the gate agent called Mister Moussaoui. [MarketWatch note: Zacarias Moussaoui was arrested in late 2001 and pled guilty to being part of the 9/11 attacks.] Security guards were reaching for guns and people were cowering. As I went up to the desk, the gate attendants parted like the Red Sea. Of course, she took one look at my Irish-looking face and got on the intercom to say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry, I meant Mousseau.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a true story. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve lived a very Forrest Gump life. \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098...[A] as soon as a client gives me a green light to see them, I will be on a plane. I will be doing that not only because I want to see clients, break bread, and do business the old fashioned way, but because I think I can add value. \u00e2\u0080\u0098 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 John Mousseau, Cumberland Advisors I think what you get out of this is that the country is probably going to get back to normal faster than people think, even if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a new normal. All these people out, it tells you the American people have a thirst to be out there and to be with each other. To the extent that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a positive for markets, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing it. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an attitude on the part of a lot of Americans: damn the torpedoes, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s go. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell you I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel the same way. MarketWatch: So what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the new normal, then? Mousseau: I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect it will ever go back to the way it was before. You would expect that the first normal you go back to is: people back in the office but not traveling. Step two, people may want to have visits, probably next spring. I will say this: people that say, well, my business model has now permanently changed and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to be doing everything on Zoom and Microsoft Teams MSFT, +2.48% \u00c2 and my travel and entertainment budget will be one quarter of what it was, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not thinking like that. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m thinking as soon as a client gives me a green light to see them, I will be on a plane. I will be doing that not only because I want to see clients, break bread and do business the old fashioned way, but because I think I can add value. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss:Some tech workers are slowly trickling back to the office now Barry Ritholtz is co-founder, chairman and chief investment office of Ritholtz Wealth Management, a New York-based investment advisory with about $1.3 billion in assets, but he may be better known for his outsized media presence. He was one of the first \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and remains perhaps one of the most prolific \u00e2\u0080\u0094 financial bloggers, starting \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Big Picture\u00e2\u0080\u009d in 2003. He also launched the wildly popular \u00e2\u0080\u009cMasters in Business\u00e2\u0080\u009d podcast at Bloomberg News in 2014. Ritholtz also writes regular columns for Bloomberg, tweets frequently, and regularly publishes suggested reading lists on markets, the economy, policy and more. He never spent as much time on long-haul travel as some of the other participants mentioned here \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but may have had one of the longest regular commutes from Long Island to mid-town Manhattan. That may change, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been thinking. And Ritholtz can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but try to game out the various impacts of the COVID-19 hit: to the way we live, invest and more. MarketWatch: How often did you used to travel? Barry Ritholtz: I speak at a lot of conferences and New York is a terrible place to host a conference so we host them away from New York. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not one of those people who was a road warrior but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m silver medallion on Delta DAL, +0.39% \u00c2 . \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098I love the concentration of intellectual capital. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a reason cities have been the dominant economic engine for the past few hundred years. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not in the camp that thinks it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going away, but I do think offices have learned something.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Barry Ritholtz, Ritholtz Wealth Management MarketWatch: What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it been like being stuck at home? Ritholtz: It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s me, the wife and two dogs. I have jokingly said there are two types of people in lockdown: those who are having fun with it, and those who have small children. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m happy that we live in suburbia. I miss going into the office in the city but dear lord, what a delight it is to be surrounded by greenery. If I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m in my office over the garage and my wife is on the other side of the house, we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even hear each other. We have two big dogs that require a lot of exercise so every day there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a long walk either with them or just us walking. We also get in the car \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we have a convertible \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and drive for half an hour just to explore new areas. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitely cabin fever, but we have settled into a very nice routine. Around 5:30 p.m. I try and wrap up whatever I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m doing work-wise, and we have cocktail hour, we open a nice bottle of wine. And we have been cooking from scratch, stuff you never have time to do. I keep pulling out these gadgets that were wedding gifts or anniversary gifts all these years, I mean, who has time for an air fryer? But bacon and chicken wings in the air fryer are amazing. I am waiting to see which of our favorite restaurants don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make it. Barry Ritholtz doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind this commute one bit. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss fighting my way through TSA, through the airports, whatever. This has helped me discover how inefficient traveling to other places is. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to give a keynote for 45 minutes to an hour, that requires 72-96 hours, not counting prep for the actual presentation... If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing a Zoom presentation, it takes less time to prepare than it would normally take me to pack. I do miss getting out to other cities, seeing clients. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really nice having face time. MarketWatch: What will the new normal look like? Ritholtz: Our office is right on Bryant Park. I had been thinking about getting a second floor. And working from home has kind of made me think, gee maybe I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to [expand]. On any given day there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eight to 15 people, and I thought like 15 people were our ceiling. Now I think maybe 20-24 people are our ceiling if [work-from-home arrangements become more permanent, and people stagger their time in the office.] I love the concentration of intellectual capital. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a reason cities have been the dominant economic engine for the past few hundred years. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not in the camp that thinks it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going away, but I do think offices have learned something.

Ritholtz: The Masters In Business podcast came about because of a layover. I was watching TV while waiting to make a connection from Vancouver to New York. I remember being infuriated watching an interview with, I think, Bill Ackman. It was the dumbest questions: what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your favorite stock, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the Fed going to do. On the plane, I bumped into someone I knew and we swapped seats to sit next to each other to talk. I remember saying, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe how dumb that was. This person said, well, what would you ask? I said: what are your favorite books, who are your mentors, if a college grad wanted to go into your field of business, what would your advice be. Maybe it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Ackman. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember. Maybe it was John Paulson. Barron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s:How Can Businesses Help Limit the Spread of Coronavirus?"}]}
