Equities lost steam after the White House reiterated a call to cap the next round of COVID-19 stimulus at $1 trillion or less, but accelerated their losses in the final hour of trade, after several Federal Reserve officials warned of challenges to the economy as infection rates soar across several states. How did benchmarks perform? The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% tumbled 396.85 points, or 1.5%, to end at 25,890.18, the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% shed 34.40 points, or 1.1%, closing at 3,145.32 and end a 5-session win steak; while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.39% fell 89.76 points, or 0.9%, to finish at 10,343.89, after carving out an intraday 10,518.98 record. On Monday, the Dow gained 459.67 points, or 1.8%, to end at 26,287.03. The S&P 500 climbed 49.71 points, or 1.6%, ending at 3,179.72 and matching its longest win streak, five straight sessions, since the period ended Dec. 17; while the Nasdaq surged 226.02 points, or 2.2%, to 10,433.65, scoring its third straight record and its 24th of the 2020. What drove the market? Nagging unease over the outlook for the global economy in the midst of rising U.S. coronavirus infections helped dampen the buying mood on Wall Street. The White House added to those concerns Tuesday when Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s top aide said the Trump administration wants Congress to cap the next COVID-19 stimulus package at $1 trillion or less, during an interview with Bloomberg Radio. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously been a lot of stimulus put in the system over the last couple bills, and so the price tag for us would be that,\u201d said Marc Short, Pence\u2019s chief of staff. Jon Adams, senior market strategist at BMO Global Asset Management, pointed to the interview as one of the reasons why the stock rally took a breather Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s really clear to us that policy is driving markets and seems to be the only thing that matters,\u201d he told MarketWatch. \u201cWe\u2019re constructive on risk assets, but perhaps a bit less so than a few months ago.\u201d While calls from the Republican ranks for limits on further coronavirus relief aren\u2019t new, the latest salvo from the White House comes as U.S. coronavirus cases neared 3 million, and Arizona, California, Texas and other states were expressing concerns about their hospitals rapidly filling up. The Trump administration also on Tuesday began the formal process of withdrawing from the World Health Organization, starting the clock on a one-year exit timeline and jeopardizing its top funding source for aid during a global pandemic. Earlier in the session, investors drew some hope from an employment report that showed a record 6.5 million people either found jobs or were rehired in May, following a prolonged shutdown due to the coronavirus that drove the U.S. into a deep recession. Job openings also rose to 5.4 million in April from 5 million in the prior month, according to a Labor Department report that\u2019s released with a one-month delay. The number of jobs available was running around 7 million before the pandemic. However, San Francisco Fed President Daly said Tuesday the U.S. unemployment rate underestimates the economic damage of the virus, while Richmond Fed President Barkin said the central bank still has \u201cmore to do\u201d with the jobless rate at 11.1%, during a virtual talk on the pandemic at the National Association for Business Economics. Read: Federal Reserve leaders see \u2018bumpier\u2019 recovery, slower decline in unemployment During a separate online talk, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said COVID-19 may be threatening the pace of the U.S. recovery, according to a Bloomberg report, a day after he described the recovery as \u201cleveling off,\u201d and raising doubts about a V-shaped, or swift and powerful, economic rebound. The warnings come as some states roll back business reopenings with COVID-19 cases soaring. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Tuesday that the U.S., unlike much of Europe, is now seeing \u201cthe consequence of community spread, which is even more difficult to contain.\u201d Market participants also attributed some of the day\u2019s malaise to dimming outlook for quarterly corporate earnings reports, even though they are widely expected to be poor, given the challenges posed by the pandemic. Refinitiv\u2019s latest earnings scorecard has the S&P 500 index\u2019s second quarter, year over year, blended earnings growth estimate at negative 43.4%, while noting the growth rate for the index drops to negative 38.2% if the battered energy sector is excluded. Opinion: Robert Shiller explains the pandemic stock market and why it\u2019s decoupled from the economy On the global front, the Organization for Economic and Cooperation and Development said on Tuesday that unemployment will reach the highest level since the Great Depression and may not return to pre-crisis levels until 2022. In addition, the European Commission lowered its eurozone economic forecast by a percentage point, predicting a contraction of 8.7% this year.
