AAPL, +1.74% announced new iPads Tuesday as part of an event that also brought the introduction of new Apple Watches, a new fitness subscription service, and new bundles for subscriptions. Apple's eighth-generation iPad will have an A12 bionic chip that marks the first time Apple is bringing its neural engine to the entry-level iPad model. The device begins at $329 and has a 10.2-inch screen. Apple also unveiled a new iPad Air, which has a 10.9-inch display and begins at $599. This device features a fingerprint sensor on the top button and upgrades to both the camera and sound. The company is rolling out the iPad Air in five color options-silver, space gray, rose gold, green, and sky blue-and it will connect via a USB-C port. Apple shares are up 0.5% and the company's product-launch event has concluded. Apple didn't make announcements about new iPhone models and presumably will save those for an event later in the fall."}]}
