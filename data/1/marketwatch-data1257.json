That extra money is set to expire at the end of next month if lawmakers fail to act. Related: The extra $600 Americans get in weekly unemployment benefits ends next month \u2014 here\u2019s what lawmakers are proposing to replace it The boost in unemployment benefits \u201cwas a really important thing to do when we were closing the economy back in March,\u201d Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia said Wednesday on CNBC. \u201cI don\u2019t think that the $600 benefit is the answer going forward,\u201d he added. Josh Bivens, director of research at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, couldn\u2019t disagree more. \u201c \u2018Cutting off a policy support that helps households maintain spending is a terrible idea, both for these households\u2019 welfare and for macroeconomic stabilization.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Josh Bivens, director of research at the Economic Policy Institute Given that approximately 10% to 15% of U.S. GDP is driven by consumption, allowing those benefits to expire will strip more than 20 million Americans of a total of nearly $842 billion to spend, according to data released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, a U.S. government agency that provides official macroeconomic and industry statistics. \u201cWhen the economy\u2019s growth is demand-constrained, anything that keeps households from cutting back on spending actually supports growth,\u201d he said. \u201cCutting off a policy support that helps households maintain spending is a terrible idea, both for these households\u2019 welfare and for macroeconomic stabilization.\u201d Don\u2019t miss: \u2018We are saving every penny we can\u2019: What life could look like for this 66-year-old man when he loses all his unemployment benefits next month Keeping the supplemental $600 in place through the middle of next year \u201cwould provide an average quarterly boost to GDP of 3.7% and employment of 5.1 million workers,\u201d Bivens predicted, using the Bureau of Economic Analysis data. That\u2019s largely because Americans would have more money to spend which would in turn prevent retailers from having to layoff more workers, he said. Last month\u2019s retail sales report, which documented a record 17.7% jump in retail sales, may support Bivens\u2019 theory, given that nearly 2.7 million Americans who were temporarily laid off amid the coronavirus pandemic were rehired."}]}
