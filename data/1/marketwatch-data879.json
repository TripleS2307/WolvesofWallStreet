That is one of the initial conclusions of legal experts and developers following Epic Games Inc.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawsuits against Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.74% \u00c2 \u00c2 and Alphabet Inc.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s GOOGL, +1.82% \u00c2 GOOG, +1.97% \u00c2 Google for booting Epic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hit videogame \u00e2\u0080\u009cFortnite\u00e2\u0080\u009d out of their app stores Thursday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFortnite\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u009d ouster came after Epic publicly announced an offer for players to receive a discount on in-game purchases if they paid Epic directly. (Late Monday, Epic sought a temporary restraining order in federal court in California to block Apple from removing \u00e2\u0080\u009cFortnite\u00e2\u0080\u009d from the App Store. Epic also asked the court to stop the iPhone maker from terminating its developer account on Aug. 28.) Epic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s size and market influence just might be the impetus to ramp up antitrust investigation, said Ram Mohan, chief operating officer of domain-name registrar Afilias Inc. \u00e2\u0080\u009cClearly, for the first time, there is a company that has the ability to challenge the rules that Apple and Google have created,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mohan told MarketWatch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSmaller companies can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do that. Ironically, it takes big tech to take on Big Tech.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Underscoring Epic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s standing, Spotify Technology Inc. SPOT, +0.08% \u00c2 and Match Group Inc. MTCH, -0.94% \u00c2 quickly offered statements of support, and Facebook Inc. FB, +0.26% \u00c2 later claimed Apple refused to wave its 30% fee on Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new paid online events feature. FB, +0.26% FB, +0.26% Read more: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Fortnite\u00e2\u0080\u0099 maker accuses Apple, Google of illegal monopolistic practices in tech battle royale FB, +0.26% FB, +0.26% Eventbrite Inc. EB, -0.09% \u00c2 , too, could join the chorus of dissent. The company said it has been notified it has until December to start following Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rules on in-app purchases because of events going online. Privately held Epic could prove to be Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most dangerous antagonist, both financially and symbolically. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFortnite\u00e2\u0080\u009d hauled in $1 billion in player spending on Apple iOS devices through mid-May, based on estimates from mobile-app research company Sensor Tower, suggesting Apple received hundreds of millions of dollars from the hit videogame. In the larger picture, Epic represents a videogame industry that may prove a tipping point for anti-competitive actions by federal lawmakers, who grilled the chief executives of Apple, Facebook, Google, and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +3.01% \u00c2 in a landmark antitrust hearing last month, as well as separate investigations by the Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general. Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +2.48% \u00c2 has excoriated Apple for its stance on cloud gaming apps, which the iPhone maker does not allow on the App Store for apparent violations of its guidelines. When asked for comment on Epic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legal actions, Apple late Monday emailed the following statement: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe App Store is designed to be a safe and trusted place for users and a great business opportunity for all developers. Epic has been one of the most successful developers on the App Store, growing into a multibillion dollar business that reaches millions of iOS customers around the world. We very much want to keep the company as part of the Apple Developer Program and their apps on the Store. The problem Epic has created for itself is one that can easily be remedied if they submit an update of their app that reverts it to comply with the guidelines they agreed to and which apply to all developers. We won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make an exception for Epic because we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right to put their business interests ahead of the guidelines that protect our customers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unbending stance on videogaming \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and pushback from developers, both small and large \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is the type of scenario that feeds into antitrust pressure on Apple and Google to change their platform operations, said Rebecca Allensworth, a law professor at Vanderbilt University. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAntitrust has always had a dual system of enforcement: Private like the Epic suits, and public such as FTC and DoJ investigations,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Allensworth told MarketWatch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCompanies feel maximal pressure when under both kinds of scrutiny.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Antitrust attorney Jonathan Rubin adds, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat the Epic suit suggests is that even private marketplaces organized within the confines of a private company should be subject to antitrust oversight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So far, only a small developer, Blix Inc., has taken on Apple \u00e2\u0080\u0094 both in court, and in cooperating with the office of Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., chairman of the House Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law. Cicilline led an hours-long inquisition of the four CEOs\u00c2 on July 29.

I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a big step forward, and pushes momentum for stronger antitrust scrutiny,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Blix co-CEO Ben Volach told MarketWatch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard this from Spotify [it filed a complaint with the European Commission last year against Apple, charging the iPhone maker with anti-competitive behavior related in part to the fees it charges on purchases made through the App Store], but it took a bold move in the U.S. Epic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s action talks to a broader monopoly by Apple.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Blix, which claims it has data showing Apple suppressed App Store rankings of products that compete with Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own apps, sued Apple last October, alleging patent infringement and antitrust violations. Blix also believes Apple and Google are working in concert on pricing, which led Google to abruptly kick its BlueMail email app off its Play Store \u00e2\u0080\u0094 36 hours after Blix developers revealed they cooperated with House lawmakers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGoogle retaliated against us for outspokenness on antitrust issues,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Volach said. A Google spokesperson said in a written statement that the BlueMail app had been reinstated to the store. Volach countered that unfavorable media coverage forced Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand after only 15 hours. Yet it might take the actions of much larger companies like Epic to move the needle on antitrust actions in a political setting that is growing increasingly hostile to Big Tech. For years, developers have groused about Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 30% tax as exorbitantly high. But many felt they had no choice: There are some 1.5 billion Apple gadgets in use worldwide, and users of Apple devices collectively spend nearly twice as much on apps as do owners of Android gadgets. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt shows the power of Apple and Google, when you have a company as big as Spotify teaming up with Epic. When titans are taking on titans, you know there is a problem, and that gets people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jamie Court, president of nonprofit Consumer Watchdog, told MarketWatch."}]}
