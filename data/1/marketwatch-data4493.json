EKSO, +0.79% soared Thursday, after the company said it has received 501 clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to market its EksoNR robotic exoskeleton for use in patients with acquired brain injury, or ABI. The device is first to get FDA clearance for use with ABI, a category of brain injury that includes severe head injuries and concussions, as well as stroke, aneurysms, brain tumors, anoxia, degenerative and metabolic conditions, infections, and surgical injuries, among others, the company said in a statement. \"Combined annual incidence of TBI and stroke alone represent an estimated patient population of 3.7 million in the U.S. and 84 million globally,\" said the statement. The FDA has already cleared the device for use in stroke and spinal cord injury. Ekso, based in Richmond, California, had a net loss of $2.5 million in its latest quarter, narrower than the loss of $6.6 million posted in the year-earlier period. Revenue came to $1.5 million, down from $3.6 million, as the pandemic led some customers to delay orders. Shares were last up 137%."}]}
