Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrician at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia and a co-inventor of the rotavirus vaccine, told friends not to worry about the coronavirus. He went on CNN with the journalist Christiane Amanpour to talk about why the virus that was hitting Asia so hard would not impact the U.S. any more than the flu. \u201cI am on the record as being dead wrong about this,\u201d Offit said. His come-to-Jesus moment? When he realized that Americans were not prepared to wear masks and lock down their lives in the same way that people did in countries including China and South Korea. \u201cI never imagined it would be this bad,\u201d he said. \u201cLooking at what happened in China, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, I was looking at the size of those countries compared with the size of our country, and I thought there is no way this virus is going to be worse than the flu this year.\u201d \u201c \u2018People now see vaccines as a magic dust that\u2019s about to be sprinkled over this country and make this all go away. It doesn\u2019t work that way.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Dr. Paul Offit As a vaccine expert \u2014 he helped develop the rotavirus vaccine, which protects young children against infections with the virus that can cause severe diarrhea, and sits on the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee \u2014 Offit is now keeping a close eye on the clinical trials under way for COVID-19 vaccine candidates and the Trump administration\u2019s potential influence on federal agencies closely involved in the pandemic response. \u201cThe government has shown its capacity to impose its will on science-based federal agencies\u201d in the Trump era, he said. \u201cThere is a reason to worry.\u201d MarketWatch: The first thing I want to talk about is the adverse event in the AstraZeneca AZN, +1.16% AZN, +0.63% trial. What\u2019s your thinking on these types of events, especially for people who are seeing headlines about this but may not understand the ins and outs of the trial process? Dr. Paul Offit: It\u2019s not unusual to have a clinical trial be put on hold, if there\u2019s a temporal association between receiving a vaccine and having a severe adverse event. Usually the data safety monitoring board says, \u201cThis happened. This person got a vaccine. You need to take a look.\u201d So they take a look, and they see whether there\u2019s any other evidence of it in other people who\u2019ve gotten the vaccine. The regulators also look at those data and say that they think that the trial should stop or that they think that this is not a consequence of the vaccine. There\u2019s so much attention on this particular vaccine. We\u2019re all talking about it. The problem is we don\u2019t really know anything about it. AstraZeneca hasn\u2019t put out anything. Maybe it\u2019s transverse myelitis. Maybe it\u2019s not. You know when you see a detailed clinical description, and until then you really don\u2019t know. It\u2019s not an easy diagnosis to make. Sometimes it\u2019s a diagnosis of exclusion. MarketWatch: Are you concerned about the speed at which we\u2019re developing vaccines? Does this raise red flags, or is this just a matter of the moment and the science? Offit: Well, there\u2019s been a lot of money put into this by [the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority], by the World Health Organization, by the Gates Foundation, that has basically taken the risk out of it for at least for some of the smaller pharmaceutical companies. Moderna Inc. MRNA, +0.09% would not normally do a Phase 3 trial at the same time they would be mass producing their vaccine. They would wait to see whether it works and was safe before they mass produced it. What the government said is, \u201cLook, we\u2019ll take the risk out of it for you. We\u2019ll pay for the Phase 3 trial. We\u2019ll pay for mass production.\u201d That\u2019s good, actually. A vaccine is part of what\u2019s going to get us out of this mess. On the other hand, you cannot truncate the Phase 3 trials. That is the proof that cannot be short-circuited. What I worry about is something I wrote about with [American oncologist, bioethicist and senior fellow at the Center for American Progress] Zeke Emanuel in an op-ed in the New York Times at the beginning of June: an \u201cOctober surprise\u201d \u2014 that the government would find a way to truncate that trial, declare victory and put it out there. Watching what happened with hydroxychloroquine, watching what happened with convalescent plasma, watching what happens with climate change and the EPA, the government has shown its capacity to impose its will on science-based federal agencies. There is a reason to worry. But I think there\u2019s so much attention on this, and there\u2019s such skittishness in the American public, that if the American public got a hint that things were being truncated, that academics were standing up and saying, \u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t get this vaccine,\u201d I don\u2019t think it would work. Convalescent plasma has largely died the death it should have died because you had the [National Institutes of Health and] Tony Fauci saying there\u2019s no evidence that this works. MarketWatch: How worried are you about people choosing not to vaccinate over fears about the safety of vaccines? Offit: Once we know the characteristics of these vaccines, then we can explain what we know and what we don\u2019t know. Let\u2019s say theoretically that a vaccine\u2019s 75% active at preventing moderate to severe disease. It\u2019s been in 20,000 people, including people over [the age of] 65, people who are African-American or Latino, people who have certain co-morbidities, and it\u2019s been shown to be safe. First of all, you\u2019re not going to have enough vaccine, even for the people who were in the first-tier groups [who are designated by the U.S. to be at high risk of contracting the virus and so would have the first opportunity to be vaccinated]. It\u2019s going to slowly roll out. If there\u2019s problems, it\u2019ll pop up. That\u2019s the only way you\u2019re going to know. You can\u2019t rule out rare or adverse events pre-approval. But there are systems in place, like the Vaccine Safety Datalink [a safety monitoring project set up by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and others, that will pick up those rare events. The most convincing thing is when people see other people getting it, and there\u2019s not a problem. MarketWatch: The CDC just put out its proposal for distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. We\u2019ve never seen a mass vaccination like this. What do you think this process is going look like? What are you worried about? Offit: There\u2019s going to be a lot of assembling. First of all, it\u2019s a two-dose vaccine. You need to vaccinate the person, and they need to come back again a month later. Secondly, it\u2019s going to be certain tiers [of people] that are recommended to get it: people who are over 65, people who work in health care, people who work in education. Now, there may be people who want to get this vaccine who don\u2019t fall into any individual first-tier groups who will probably find a way to get it. If you\u2019re distributing this vaccine not only in physicians\u2019 offices but in large chain pharmacies, are we asking those pharmacies to make sure that the patient proves that they\u2019re in one of those groups? And, if so, how would they do that? That\u2019s another problem. The third problem is [the storage and refrigeration needs] if one or more of the vaccines that come out are these messenger RNA vaccines. [The vaccines being developed by Moderna and BioNTech BNTX, +1.23% and Pfizer Inc. PFE, -0.27% are mRNA vaccines.] We\u2019ve never done that before in this country. Never. It means shipping and storing, with dry ice, which we\u2019ve never done. And so we would have to make sure that people have the boxes, the storage facilities, where they could do that. There\u2019s going to be a learning curve here. MarketWatch: Some of these vaccines are going to be two doses. Do we know much about adherence to a two-dose vaccination regimen? Offit: [GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s GSK, +1.10% shingles vaccine] Shingrix is a two-dose vaccine, separated by a month. People come and get a second dose. MarketWatch: The FDA guidance in June suggested around 50% for the COVID-19 vaccines. Do you think there needs to be more education to the public that the vaccine may not be a sure shot in protecting against the virus? Offit: Even if it\u2019s highly effective, it\u2019s still not going to be a sure shot. If you get 75%, that means one out of every four people who get it could still get moderate to severe disease, which can cause them to be hospitalized or die, which is why they\u2019re still going to need to wear a mask. It will probably be a greater percentage, more than 25%, who could still get either mild infections or asymptomatic infections or they could still shed and be contagious. That\u2019s what worries me the most. People say, \u201cGreat. I\u2019m vaccinated. I can engage in high-risk activity, and I\u2019m going to throw away my mask.\u201d [Wearing a mask] is the most powerful thing we can do. MarketWatch: So, post-vaccination, are we still going to be wearing masks? Offit: Yes, for a couple of years, and doing the best we can to social distance. We can go back to school, as long as we do the kinds of things they\u2019ve done in Denmark and other countries that have been able to do this successfully. We just don\u2019t have that kind of federal leadership, sadly. People now see vaccines as a magic dust that\u2019s about to be sprinkled over this country and make this all go away. It doesn\u2019t work that way. MarketWatch: Do you want to see an authorization or an approval for the vaccine? Offit: I\u2019m not sure it matters, as long as we hold this vaccine to the same standards we do to every other vaccine for the last 70 years, whether it\u2019s called a licensure or an approval or authorization.
