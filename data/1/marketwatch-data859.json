That may also be a positive sign for vaccines", "body": "Promising new clinical data for an experimental COVID-19 treatment hints at a secondary but possibly more important takeaway for investors: if this neutralizing antibody treatment works in coronavirus patients, so will the vaccines that are in development. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. REGN, +0.36% on Tuesday shared preliminary data from a Phase 1/2/3 clinical trial for REGN-COV2, finding that the investigational therapy reduced viral load and made symptoms go away sooner in some non-hospitalized patients with mild or moderate cases of COVID-19. It was most effective in patients with higher viral loads who had not tested positive for antibodies. Regeneron\u2019s stock was up 0.1% in Thursday trade. \u201cWe believe our data will have positive implications for the likelihood of success of vaccines that target the same spike protein that REGN-COV2 targets,\u201d Regeneron CEO Leonard Schleifer told investors on Tuesday, according to a FactSet transcript of the call.

Along with Regeneron\u2019s candidate, Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, +2.20% is also developing one, called LY-CoV555 and produced using the plasma of people who have recovered from COVID-19 infections. In mid-September, the drugmaker released promising interim data from a Phase 2 trial for LY-CoV555. Wall Street analysts view an emergency use authorization for REGN-COV2 as somewhat inevitable \u2014 \u201cWe live in interesting times,\u201d Bernstein analysts wrote in an investor note \u2014 and perhaps one that will arrive before the election in November. SVB Leerink\u2019s Geoffrey Porges predicts that both Lilly and Regeneron\u2019s antibody cocktails will receive authorization from the FDA this year. Yet what excited them the most was the broader implication that if an antibody-based cocktail appears to work in some COVID-19 patients, how will that finding carry over to the closely watched field of vaccine development. \u201cWe are most focused on [second] derivative read-through,\u201d Raymond James analysts wrote in a note on Tuesday to investors. \u201cIf treatment works, prophylaxis should work, and if prophylaxis works, vaccines should work.\u201d Read: There are seven coronavirus vaccine candidates being tested in the U.S. \u2014 here\u2019s where they stand There are seven vaccine candidates in clinical trials in the U.S., including four that have moved into Phase 3 trials. (The late-stage study for AstraZeneca AZN, +1.16% AZN, +0.63% and the University of Oxford\u2019s vaccine candidate is still paused in the U.S.) The vaccines use what is called the S-protein as their immunogen. Regeneron\u2019s therapy includes two different forms of S-protein antibodies. \u201cThe implications here for timing of market opening are positive,\u201d Bernstein analysts wrote. \u201cTo the extent antibody cocktail is available in additional [to] vaccines in early 2021, the confidence individual[s] will have in de-distancing will increase.\u201d So far this year, Regeneron\u2019s stock has soared 50.6%, shares of Lilly are up 9.9%, and the S&P SPX, +0.87% has gained 4.1%."}]}
