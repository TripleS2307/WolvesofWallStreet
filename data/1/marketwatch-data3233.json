In testimony prepared for the Senate Banking Committee, Powell acknowledged some economic indicators have pointed to a stabilization in activity and others have even suggested \u00e2\u0080\u009ca modest rebound.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Live blog:Fed Chairman Powell testifies before Senate on economic outlook \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat said, the levels of output and employment remain far below their pre-pandemic levels, and significant uncertainty remains about the timing and strength of the recovery,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Powell said. The Fed chairman said until the coronavirus disease is contained, a full recovery is unlikely. U.S. equity indexes DJIA, +0.56% \u00c2 SPX, +0.87% \u00c2 jumped on Tuesday in part after the government reported retail sales surged a record 17.7% in May. But the level of sales remains below February\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pre-pandemic level. The U.S. regained 2.5 million jobs in May and the unemployment rate fell to 13.3%, confounding Wall Street expectations for another big wave of layoffs. Stocks had fallen last week with some analysts blaming Powell for a grim outlook at his press conference. The Fed announced last week that it would keep buying Treasurys and agency-backed mortgage securities. The central bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s balance sheet has swelled by $3 trillion since early March, mainly from these purchases. The Fed has also set up 11 lending programs to get credit flowing in all corners of the financial markets, including corporate bonds. When a few Senators expressed concern with the Fed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s asset purchases, Powell tried to mollify them. Sen Pat Toomey, a Republican of Pennsylvania, said the Fed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s corporate bond purchases were unnecessary and were distorting market signals. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see us as wanting to run through the bond market like an elephant...snuffing out price signals and things like that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Powell said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe just want to be there if things turn bad for the economy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. Read:Dovish Fed to continue asset purchases Later, Powell said the central bank wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t buying asset to make it easier for the U.S. Treasury Department to sell the increased debt. This is known as \u00e2\u0080\u009cmonetizing the debt.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is certainly not our intention,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Powell replied. The Fed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s asset purchases were needed because financial markets stopped working when investors all decided to move to cash. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in any way about meeting Treasurys supply. We really don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think of that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, adding there is a lot of demand for Treasurys. Economists think the indicators could show a strong rebound in May and June but then the economy might falter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe early part[s] of this recovery are going to be in a way easy because they are coming off such low levels,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and this might last through July, said Mike Feroli, chief U.S. economist at J.P. Morgan Chase. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter that, the story gets a little more interesting,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Feroli added. In his testimony, Powell said he thought the economy would go through three stages. The first stage was the shutdown with a sharp drop in activity and that may end at the end of June. The second part will be the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbounceback\u00e2\u0080\u009d with people going back to work. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing apparently the beginning of that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Powell said. The third stage will be the economy \u00e2\u0080\u009cwell short\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the pre-pandemic level in February. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMuch of that economic uncertainty comes from the uncertainty about the path of the disease and the effects of measures to contain it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Powell said. He said the Fed was committed to using its full range of tools to assure the recovery from the recession will be as robust as possible. Powell did not say Congress needed to pass another emergency funding package to help the economy but he gently pushed lawmakers, saying more spending \u00e2\u0080\u009ccan make a critical difference not just in helping families and businesses in a time of need, but also in limiting long-lasting damage to our economy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Several Democrats pressed Powell on the issue of inequality. Asked if the Fed was responsible for unequal outcomes for black people, Powell said everyone could do more. The central bank would be looking for ways to do just that, he added."}]}
