S&P Dow Jones Indices announced Friday afternoon that it will add three companies to the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% \u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Catalent Inc. CTLT, +1.90% \u00c2 , Etsy Inc. ETSY, +5.11% \u00c2 and Teradyne Inc. TER, +4.38% Tesla Inc. TSLA, +1.89% \u00c2 was thought to be in line for the addition after announcing a fourth consecutive quarter of profitability, a requirement of the index, which many observers cited as a reason for a gigantic increase in the electric-car company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stock in recent weeks. \u00e2\u0080\u009cS&P 500 inclusion now likely a done deal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said after Tesla reported a profitable quarter in July. When reached Friday, Ives said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Champagne was on ice to get into the S&P 500, [it] was baked into shares.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis was a bit of a shocker and the Street assumed this was a foregone conclusion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ives said in an email to MarketWatch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTesla not getting into the S&P 500 club is a head scratcher and the stock will likely be down for the indexing implications.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ives reiterated his neutral rating on Tesla shares in a note later Friday. Only 22% of sell-side analysts tracked by FactSet consider Tesla a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbuy\u00e2\u0080\u009d as of Friday afternoon, which was actually an increase from earlier in the week, but still well lower than other stocks in the S&P 500 index. Tesla stock has added more than 31% since announcing second-quarter earnings on the afternoon of July 22, though that performance has declined this week \u00e2\u0080\u0094 at the end of Monday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trading session, the stock had gained 56% since earnings. Shares have suffered this week in the wake of a stock split, the announcement of a plan to sell up to $5 billion in fresh shares, and insider selling. Overall, the electric-car company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shares have still quintupled this year, pushing its market capitalization to $380 billion as of Friday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s closing bell. Three previous members of the S&P Midcap 400 will move up to the larger index instead, replacing three other companies that moved down to the midcap index, H&R Block Inc. HRB, -1.80% \u00c2 , Coty Inc. COTY, -5.08% \u00c2 and Kohl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Corp. KSS, -1.64% \u00c2 The changes will take effect before the open of trading on Sept. 21. Tesla stock fell more than 6% in after-hours trading following the announcement. Catalent shares rose nearly 3%, Etsy shares added more than 5%, and Teradyne stock increased more than 2%."}]}
