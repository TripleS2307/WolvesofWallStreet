When someone with COVID-19 leaves the hospital, doctors\u2019 discharge instructions and the media tend to focus on physical recovery, which can be difficult. But we hear much less about the psychological toll. Coronavirus survivors often have psychological effects ranging from anxiety to depression to PTSD. Many recovering from the disease feel stigma. Megan Hosey, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins Medical School and a clinical psychologist who works in the ICU and a COVID-19 inpatient rehab unit, says some recovering from the coronavirus live with survivor\u2019s guilt. \u201cThey\u2019re concerned that a loved one or a neighbor might have picked it up, and the patient is very concerned that they might be judged for that,\u201d says Hosey. \u201cSome of our patients are talking about survivor\u2019s guilt. For example, if a loved one died of the disease, the question might remain in their mind, \u2018Why did I make it but my loved ones didn\u2019t?\u2019\u201d Here are stories of two people who\u2019ve been dealing with the aftereffects of coronavirus, plus advice from Hosey on coping with the emotional strain of COVID-19:Esther Aguayo Rocha: Back living together, but separately Esther Aguayo Rocha, 73, considers herself healthy despite having pre-existing conditions that made her more susceptible to severe COVID-19 disease \u2014 high blood pressure, diabetes and a kidney transplant. She wound up in the hospital with coronavirus for 10 days, some of it in the ICU, and then isolated at home for 2\u00bd weeks. Due to the coronavirus, Rocha, who is retired and formerly ran a day care center, developed acute kidney injury. That\u2019s an abrupt kidney dysfunction, a common consequence of severe COVID-19. Also see: Here\u2019s how the U.S. could save 45,000 people from dying of COVID-19 by November According to the National Kidney Foundation, 15% of patients hospitalized with the coronavirus and 20% or more of those who have been in an ICU get acute kidney injury. The acute kidney injury led to swelling and problems with her electrolytes. \u201cI couldn\u2019t even text because it felt like my fingers were twice their size,\u201d says Rocha. After being discharged, Rocha\u2019s adult daughter and son made a \u201csick area\u2019 for her \u2014 to keep her husband Arturo safe. \u201cThey did a barricade of plastic so I wouldn\u2019t escape from my two rooms. I wanted to, let me tell you,\u201d she says. Living together apart in the same house, the couple would call each other or speak from open windows. \u201cI still couldn\u2019t hear him from the window, so we used to get the phone and we would talk to each other through the window. He would be outside the house and I\u2019d be inside the room,\u201d Rocha says. Her recovery took time. Still weak, Rocha could walk from one room to another and then needed to rest in bed. Her children took turns coming over to cook and do housework. When Rocha finally left her house in her daughter\u2019s car, she felt like the world had changed. \u201cI kept looking, \u2018Oh wow! Oh, wow!\u2019 [My daughter] goes, \u2018Mom, you\u2019ve already seen all this before.\u2019 I go, \u2018I know, but I\u2019m seeing it again,\u2019\u201d Rocha says. She is thankful that her kidney function has since returned to normal. Rocha is still cautious, however. \u201cIf you\u2019re asking me if I\u2019m scared to be out there? Oh yes, I\u2019m very scared,\u201d she says. For now, she relishes the small things in life that give her joy. \u201cSometimes, I\u2019ll tell my husband, \u2018You know what? I want a hamburger.\u2019 He would say, \u2018OK, let\u2019s go for a ride.\u2019 We\u2019ll go for a ride and bring it home. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve done. Then in the evening time, we usually go outside in the backyard and just look at the flowers.\u201dNick L\u00ea: Deluged by paperwork and memories Nick L\u00ea, 64, a former refugee who fled Vietnam by boat at 22, compares surviving COVID-19 to living through the destruction of his hometown, Hue, during the carnage of the 1968 Tet Offensive. \u201cThat wartime, we can see the enemy, we can see the bullets and weapons,\u201d says L\u00ea, a retired engineer in Milpitas, Calif. \u201cBut now you don\u2019t see the enemy. It comes from nowhere. So, it\u2019s scary.\u201d His wife (he prefers to keep her name private), as well as his son and daughter in their 30s, contracted the coronavirus, too. L\u00ea struggled with COVID-19 at home; the rest of his family went to the hospital. Also see: Coronavirus can spread in the air \u2018beyond any reasonable doubt,\u2019 over 200 scientists tell the World Health Organization L\u00ea\u2019s wife, then 64, and his son were put on ventilators. His son came home after 17 days. His wife died in the hospital; she was on a ventilator for roughly three weeks. For years, L\u00ea and his wife had talked about advance care planning and estate planning. She had helped others do that in her job as a Realtor. But the couple never got around to it. See: Do your family a favor and make your wishes clear with an advance medical directive \u201cWe\u2019d say, \u2018Oh it\u2019s no hurry. OK, next month, then next month, then next month.\u2019 And it ended up we hadn\u2019t had time to do it. It just happened so quick and unexpected. Everything fell through a crack. A big crack,\u201d says L\u00ea. Still grieving, L\u00ea has had to deal with a deluge of paperwork from his wife\u2019s unfinished business affairs. \u201cMy mentality is still somewhere in the middle of the sky,\u201d he says. \u201cI cannot concentrate. I am still in a state of denial. I\u2019m facing a lot of memories. Pictures of my wife everywhere, her clothing, her stuff is still all over. How can I deal with it?\u201d The couple had been together since they married at 22 and fled Vietnam together. \u201cTruly we built our own life from bare hands. She\u2019s gone now. I really miss her. I think somebody said our love was really rare to see. And I agree,\u201d says L\u00ea. Some of his friends who contracted COVID-19 have been struggling with other aftereffects. A few have ongoing memory problems. One needs an oxygen tank and can\u2019t walk on his own. He is depressed. \u201cYou can die because of depression,\u201d L\u00ea says. For now, he is staying in isolation with his son and waiting for time to help heal his sadness. \u201cIt\u2019s just like a fresh wound. It\u2019s always hurt and pain. I spend time in my garden. My wife used to enjoy a lot of backyard flowers. I keep continuing to take care of that. To make her pleased.\u201dTwo ways to cope with the emotional strain after COVID-19 Hosey offers the following two tips to cope with the emotional strain after surviving the coronavirus: Educate yourself. \u201cThe number one thing that loved ones can do is just be aware that some of these symptoms are possible,\u201d says Hosey. Try to stay up to speed physically and mentally. Hosey says staying active reduces ICU-acquired weakness and may improve cognitive and mental health outcomes as well. \u201cYou will want to be working with your [medical] team as much as you can and getting up and active, even if you\u2019re still feeling confused or tired,\u201d says Hosey.
