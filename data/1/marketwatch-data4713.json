(AP) \u2014 Patrick Mahomes and Tyrann Mathieu knew they had a platform to speak out about social injustice given their visibility and stature with the Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs. The question was what to do with it. The young quarterback and star safety, both of whom have been active the past couple of years in the Kansas City community, wanted to do more than just talk. They wanted their words to lead into action. And that\u2019s why they have joined with the Chiefs in the beginnings of a voter registration drive ahead of the November elections.

A lot of times it\u2019s more than just protesting. They really have to find a call to action. I think voter registration can impact a lot of people.\u201d There were about 245 million registered voters for the last presidential election in 2016, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, but that represents only about 64.2% of those eligible to vote. The numbers were even more bleak among young people with just over half \u2014 50.8% in the 18-24 demographic \u2014 registering and 43% turning out at the polls. That happens to be the demographic of Mahomes, who won\u2019t turn 25 until September. The Chiefs plan to announce the details of the voter registration drive at a later date, but coach Andy Reid said it has the support of owner Clark Hunt and everyone in the front office. In fact, Hunt has spoken to a number of players since the death of George Floyd at the knee of a Minneapolis police officer sparked protests nationwide, and his willingness to do whatever it takes to help affect change resonated within the diverse NFL locker room. \u201cListen, Clark was unbelievable. He was so proud of those guys,\u201d Reid said, \u201cand he called them and talked to them and that\u2019s how Clark does it. He\u2019s unbelievable with guys that way, and he\u2019s all-in and our guys know it. That\u2019s why you don\u2019t hear a lot of chatter. They know they have an open ear to talk.\u201d Mahomes and Mathieu also had prominent roles in a video organized by New Orleans Saints wide receiver Michael Thomas that addressed social injustice, and both have used their social media accounts to discuss issues of diversity and inclusion. \u201cI believe in both my statement and the video we made. That stuff needed to be said,\u201d explained Mahomes, who comes from a mixed-race family with a black father and white mother, giving him a unique perspective on the issue. \u201cWe need to come together and show that black lives do matter. It\u2019s great to feel the support we got from the Chiefs, from Coach Reid, and I\u2019ve talked to (NFL commissioner) Roger Goodell and he\u2019s shown his support for us.\u201d Mahomes said he discussed the social unrest with his father, former major league pitcher Pat Mahomes, and his godfather, former reliever LaTroy Hawkins. He also spoke with a number of current and former NFL players. His goal was to educate himself before trying to educate anybody else. \u201cI\u2019m always going to be informed of my decision, and understand there\u2019s going to be good and bad,\u201d Mahomes said, \u201cbut I\u2019m going to stand behind my words and take whatever consequences come with it, and hopefully they\u2019re positive. But I\u2019m going to be the best person I can be first, whatever that is.\u201d Mathieu was largely quiet after quarterback Collin Kaepernick\u2019s decision to take a knee to protest social injustice, but he explained that he was busy focused on himself \u2014 he was dealing with injuries and personal issues at the time. But with all those troubles in the past, the 28-year-old safety wanted to make sure he was at the forefront of the discussion now. \u201cI don\u2019t think our intentions are to be heroes. We just saw ourselves as the guys to say something, and I know a lot of us, it\u2019s been going on for a while, this problem,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of us would consider this the second time around. And the first time around a lot of us didn\u2019t speak up. A lot of us weren\u2019t vocal for a lot of reasons. And right now, collectively, I think a lot of guys just want to see things pushed forward the right way.\u201d"}]}
