Meadows called it a \u201cpolitical statement,\u201d stressing that President Donald Trump would consider additional money only as part of a broader coronavirus relief package. \u201cThat bill was not a serious bill,\u201d Meadows said. \u201cAnd my conversations with a lot of the Democrats on Capitol Hill yesterday is, if you want to be serious about it, this president is willing to put forth money and reforms.\u201d Meadows said he planned to speak with Pelosi later Sunday. The legislation heads to the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has been eyeing a $10 billion postal rescue as part of the next COVID-19 relief package. \u201cHopefully what will happen is the Republican senators will take this bill when it comes across, they\u2019ll amend it and actually address many of the things that are hurting America right now in terms of this pandemic response and be able to get it to the president\u2019s desk,\u201d Meadows said. Pelosi, however, called Meadows\u2019 proposals \u201cbare leaves,\u201d saying they don\u2019t address children facing food insecurity, people grappling with evictions, coronavirus testing and treatment or money for state and local governments. \u201cWhat they want to do is not the right path,\u201d she said Sunday. \u201cAll the president wants is this one thing: He wants his name on the letter to go out with a check in it, and he doesn\u2019t care about the rest of it.\u201d With heated debate over mail delays, the House approved the legislation in a rare Saturday session. More than two dozen House Republicans broke with the president in backing the bill, which passed 257-150. Trump had urged a no vote, railing against mail-in ballots expected to surge in the COVID-19 crisis, and the White House said he would veto it if it reached his desk. Millions of people are expected to opt for mail-in ballots to avoid polling places during the pandemic. But McConnell criticized the legislation as part of a postal \u201cconspiracy theory,\u201d echoing similar sentiments during a lively House floor debate. \u201cThe USPS is equipped to handle this election, and if a real need arises, Congress will meet it,\u201d he said Saturday in a statement. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Sunday he had secured agreement with the Postal Service\u2019s Board of Governors\u2019 new election committee to issue a report in two weeks on the service\u2019s plans to address a surge of mail-in ballots during the November elections. Under the agreement with the committee\u2019s Democratic chairman, Lee Moak, the committee would also provide weekly briefings for top Senate Democrats. The six-member Board of Governors, all of whom are Trump appointees, announced the bipartisan committee Friday to oversee mail voting. \u201cCongress will use that report to ensure that the Postal Service has every resource it needs to protect and deliver election mail and hold DeJoy and the board accountable,\u201d Schumer said. Facing a backlash over operational changes, DeJoy testified Friday in the Senate that his \u201cNo. 1 priority\u201d is to ensure election mail arrives on time. Still, the new postal leader, a Trump ally, said he would not restore the cuts to mailboxes and sorting equipment that have already been made. He could not provide senators with a plan for handling the ballot crush for the election. DeJoy is set to return Monday to testify before the House Oversight Committee. \u201cThe American people don\u2019t want anyone messing with the post office,\u201d said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., the chair of the Oversight Committee and author of the bill. \u201cThey just want their mail.\u201d Maloney\u2019s committee on Saturday released internal Postal Service documents warning about steep declines and delays in a range of mail services since early July, shortly after DeJoy took the helm. He acknowledged at the Senate hearing there has been a \u201cdip\u201d in service, but disputed reports of widespread problems. The House bill would reverse the cuts by prohibiting any changes made after January, and provide funds to the agency. The Postal Service has been struggling financially under a decline in mail volume, COVID-19-related costs and a rare and cumbersome congressional requirement to fund in advance its retiree health care benefits. For many, the Postal Service provides a lifeline, delivering not just cards and letters but also prescription drugs, financial statements and other items that are especially needed by mail during the pandemic. Meadows spoke on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d and ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d and Pelosi appeared on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d"}]}
