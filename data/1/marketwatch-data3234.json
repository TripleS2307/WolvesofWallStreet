But the bull market will \u00e2\u0080\u0098resume in earnest\u00e2\u0080\u0099, Morgan Stanley says", "body": "The three major benchmark indexes suffered their biggest weekly losses since March 20 last week, as the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u0080\u0099s downbeat economic outlook and rising coronavirus cases unsettled investors. Fears of a second wave grew over the weekend and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% \u00c2 was 310 points lower, or 1.2%, in early trading. However, in our call of the day, Morgan Stanley said last week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s correction was overdue and \u00e2\u0080\u009chealthy\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that the bull market would soon \u00e2\u0080\u009cresume in earnest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe maintain our positive view for U.S. equity markets because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s early in a new economic cycle and bull market. Last week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s correction was overdue and likely has another 5-7% downside. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s healthy and we are buyers into weakness with a small/mid-cap and cyclical tilt,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the investment bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strategists said. The team, led by equity strategist Michael Wilson, said corrections were \u00e2\u0080\u009cnormal\u00e2\u0080\u009d after rapid moves higher and that last week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s correction was overdue in what they described as a new cyclical bull market. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% could fall to 2,800, and the Nasdaq COMP, +1.39% to 8,500 \u00e2\u0080\u009cbefore the bull market resumes in earnest,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they added. Morgan Stanley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economists see this recession as being \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe steepest but also one of the shortest on record,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and its strategists agree there will be a V-shaped recovery. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe V-shaped recovery in markets is foreshadowing a V-shaped recovery in the economy and earnings. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also following the 2009 pattern almost identically in many ways,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they said. The team raised its base case S&P 500 price target through June 2021 to 3,350 from 3,000, also shifting its bull and bear cases higher \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from 3,250 to 3,700 and from 2,500 to 2,900 respectively. High quality and growth stocks would still do well as the economy recovers but would struggle to keep up with more cyclical pockets of the markets, including automobiles and consumer durables, they said.
