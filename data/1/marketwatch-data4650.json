In fact, 76% of students in a new College Reaction/Axios poll said they plan to return to campus if their schools give them the option, and 66% said they would attend in-person classes if those were on the table. Most said they were willing to wear face masks and download an app to conduct contact tracing, and 67% would leave campus again if there was a major outbreak in their community. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more, a whopping 79% of surveyed students said that they wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t attend parties the way they did before the COVID-19 pandemic swept the globe and forced schools to close. And even if athletic events stage a comeback, 71% of students said they would sit out going to games. Related:Should you attend college next fall? Before deciding, here are all the questions you should NOT be afraid to ask The poll was conducted online between July 13-14 from a representative sample of 800 college students. But a few students that MarketWatch spoke with questioned the results, and shared their own concerns about returning to campus while novel coronavirus cases continue to spike across most of the U.S., and the global case tally has passed 13.3 million. Incoming William & Mary sophomore Jonny H., who declined to give his last name, said he plans to opt out of his dorm agreement and live with friends in an off-campus apartment while attending online classes, even if his campus is open. And he said that many of his classmates are taking gap semesters or staying home, since they fear getting sick or getting their families sick. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just not sure how safe it is having so many people from different places back in one area,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jonny, 19. \u00e2\u0080\u009cStuff like the flu and mono already travel really easily on college campuses, so I know a coronavirus outbreak could harm a lot of people at my school.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Daniel Schoester, 20, a senior at Wilfrid Laurier University in Ontario, Canada, said that his school made \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe right call\u00e2\u0080\u009d in moving almost all classes online this fall, except for some science labs that may have to be held in person. The business major plans to live off campus with friends rather than in the dorms, because he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concerned about contracting the coronavirus without realizing it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGetting it and passing it on to my family, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the biggest fear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. But he would be up for attending smaller in-person classes with social distancing measures if they were available this fall. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would be way more comfortable with 15 or 20 people in classes than if it were 50, or those first-year classes that have like 1,000 people in a lecture hall. That would be a bad idea,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I would prefer to go to campus,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecause you get to connect with people and with what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re learning about more than you would with a Zoom ZM, +2.89% \u00c2 call.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Read more:How COVID-19 could spread on college campuses. Will students be safe? Schools, students and parents are grappling with the challenges of returning to campuses and in-person classes this fall, especially considering the petri dish environments where young adults share dorms and dining halls, or pack into classes, sporting events and extracurricular activities. One model run by a University of Pennsylvania mathematics professor found that with no interventions, more than 2,000 people would be infected within 30 days of the first COVID-19 infection, and about 90% of the school population would end up infected by midterms. But the model found that safety measures such as keeping large classes online and mandating facial coverings and masks, as well as moving smaller classes into bigger classrooms to allow for social distancing, had a significant impact in limiting the spread of the virus. Many colleges are trying to balance health and safety with revenue concerns, as so many schools rely on tuition, housing and parking fees, meal plans and other auxiliaries to stay afloat. So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why the majority of colleges that have announced their fall semester plans still intend to bring students back for an in-person semester. Harvard, on the other hand, has announced that all of its classes will be held online this fall, while Yale, Princeton, Rutgers and the University of Massachusetts at Amherst are leaning towards a hybrid model, with most classes being offered remotely. Princeton is opening its campus to freshman and juniors in the fall, while sophomores and seniors can return to campus in the spring, for example, to reduce population density. Rutgers will offer \u00e2\u0080\u009cextremely limited\u00e2\u0080\u009d on-campus housing, and campus events will be suspended this fall.

Both Jonny and Schoester questioned how realistic it is to expect coeds to refuse the temptation of socializing and partying, especially in light of recent reports of outbreaks among young adults that have been traced back to bars and July 4th parties. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think a lot of students will stick to their word and stay away from parties or social events, including me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jonny admitted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think the temptation will be too much for a lot of students.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Schoester agreed, noting that bars have reopened with outdoor drinking and dining patios in his area, which are \u00e2\u0080\u009cpacked every single night\u00e2\u0080\u009d and draw long lines. But it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so surprising that students are willing to risk coronavirus exposure to return to school. Traditional gap year options are a no-go. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t travel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Schoester noted. And finding work can be a tall order in this pandemic-ravaged economy. In fact, a recent graduate went viral on LinkedIn after posting about how grateful she is to find a job stocking shelves at Target TGT, +1.14%. As the Axios survey noted, \u00e2\u0080\u009creturning to a much tamer campus with far more restrictions sounds a lot better than not going back at all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Read more of MarketWatch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coronavirus coverage here."}]}
