AAPL, +1.74% on Friday imposed changes to its App Store that could severely hamper game-streaming services from Alphabet Inc.'s Google Stadia and Microsoft Corp.'s MSFT, +2.48% xCloud. Among the revisions to iOS 14, the latest version of the iPhone operating system expected later this month, one would require games offered in the service to be downloaded directly from App Store -- not from an all-in-one app. App makers are permitted to release \"catalog app\" that links to other games in the service, but each game will need to be an individual app. Apple's change comes amid a vicious legal fight with Epic Games Inc., maker of the popular game \"Fortnite,\" over several of its guidelines, including its requirement to use in-app purchases for digital products. Apple removed \"Fortnite\" from its app store in August."}]}
