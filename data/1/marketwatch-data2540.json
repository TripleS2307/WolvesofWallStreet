Then, as now, Trump trailed in the polls. Then, as now, Trump made shocking statement after shocking statement, and it seemed absurd to believe enough Americans could vote for such a dangerous, unqualified, temperamentally unfit man to be president of the United States. And yet he won. Can Trump again defy the odds and win in November? It\u2019s certainly possible, but there are a few differences this time. In 2016, Trump was able to control the campaign narrative by succeeding in getting the media to cover and describe the election in his preferred terms. Voters heard \u2014 ad nauseam \u2014 about Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. In fact, Gallup interviews found that \u201cemail dominate[d] what Americans\u2026heard about Clinton.\u201d Research showed that \u201cthe various Clinton-related email scandals accounted for more sentences [in mainstream news coverage] than all of Trump\u2019s scandals combined.\u201d Referendum on Trump In 2020, Trump is finding it harder to control the narrative, and the November election is shaping up as a referendum on him. He is now the incumbent, rather than a former reality TV star with an image (not based in reality) as a successful business tycoon. Moreover, the U.S. is dealing with multiple crises that dominate the headlines \u2014 coronavirus, the related economic downturn, and mass protests related to police killings of black Americans. Trump\u2019s preferred narrative so far isn\u2019t breaking through. He doesn\u2019t have a way now to shape media coverage to his liking. Trump\u2019s campaign rallies have been on hold for months, and when he was able to hold one this past weekend in Tulsa, Okla., he was unable to fill a 19,000 seat arena. Chris Wallace of Fox News observed that media coverage of the Tulsa rally was \u201cshow[ing] big empty areas\u201d and that the Trump campaign\u2019s deflections about the disappointing turnout \u201cmakes [the campaign] look silly when [they] deny the reality of what happened\u201d. Small crowd sizes are not an indicator that a candidate will lose, but it\u2019s clear that Trump\u2019s packed 2016 rallies helped energize him and gained outsized media coverage. In 2020 Trump is still getting plenty of media coverage, of course, but this time it may be undermining his candidacy. Trump is no longer seen as a non-ideological, relatively moderate Republican, and Joe Biden is polling better in 2020 than Clinton ever did in 2016. It may be that Americans have simply tired of Trump\u2019s divisive, bullying, boorish shtick. Republicans strike back There\u2019s at least one more thing that\u2019s different about 2020: the Lincoln Project, a super PAC run by current and former Republican and conservative political strategists, including former advisers to Republican presidents and presidential campaigns. The Lincoln Project is putting out \u201cdevastating\u201d ads that are \u201cproduced with lightning speed\u201d to \u201ccatch the public debate at just the right moment\u2026hammer[ing] Trump where he is personally most vulnerable\u201d. It\u2019s clear they are getting under Trump\u2019s skin; Keith Edwards of the Lincoln Project boasts that the group \u201clives in Donald Trump\u2019s head rent free\u201d. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } It\u2019s fair to raise questions about some of the Lincoln Project\u2019s tactics (though the same standard must be applied to Trump\u2019s own attacks against Biden), and it\u2019s hard to know whether the group\u2019s strategy is working, or even how to gauge its effectiveness. But there are at least two indications that the Lincoln Project may be having an impact. First, their ads are getting attention and coverage from major media outlets, helping to shape the campaign narrative (in part because of Trump\u2019s responses to the ads, including in late night tweetstorms). Second, if Trump is using valuable time, energy and money responding to the Lincoln Project\u2019s ads, then he is waging the campaign on his opponents\u2019 terms, not his. Clearly, it seems that nothing Trump does will shake his support from Republicans in Congress. But the Lincoln Project\u2019s effort shows that some on the political right recognize the danger Trump poses to U.S. democracy. Scholarly research shows that one of the best ways to defend democracy is for political elites to cross party lines and campaign against authoritarians from their own party. One of the failures in 2016 was that most Republicans fell in line behind Trump\u2019s candidacy \u2014 and now, his presidency. The people behind the Lincoln Project have found a way to exploit two of Trump\u2019s most notorious vulnerabilities: a short attention span and thin skin. So while the election is still several months away, committed Trump adversaries like the Lincoln Project are making it clear that it\u2019s going to be harder for Trump, who wallows in nostalgia, to get that old 2016 feeling back. Chris Edelson is an assistant professor of government in American University\u2019s School of Public Affairs. He has written two books on presidential power, and recently wrote a book chapter describing the problem of constitutional failure in the United States.
