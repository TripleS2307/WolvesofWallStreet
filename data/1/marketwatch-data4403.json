Officials were in agreement with a need to give markets more information about what would cause the central bank to keep rates close to zero or move them higher. This is called \u201cforward guidance\u201d among monetary policy experts. \u201cMost [Fed officials] commented that the FOMC should communicate a more explicit form of forward guidance for the path of the federal funds rate and provide more clarity regarding purchases of Treasury securities and agency MBS as more information about the trajectory of the economy becomes available,\u201d the Federal Open Market Committee minutes said. Many Fed watchers think the Fed will wait until September at least to take this step. The Fed has some experience with forward guidance. In late 2012, the Fed said it would keep rates at zero until the unemployment rate fell to 6.5% or inflation hit 2.5%. In their discussion about this year, a \u201cnumber\u201d of Fed officials wanted to tie any rate hike to a modest overshoot of the Fed\u2019s 2% inflation target. A \u201ccouple\u201d of others favored tieing it to the unemployment rate. A \u201cfew\u201d suggested setting a specific date. A couple of other Fed officials warned that committing to very low interest rates for a long time would pose significant risks to financial stability. Most Fed officials also agreed that asset purchases can help the economy recover from the pandemic, primarily as a tool to keep the long-end of the yield curve flat. Officials said more work was needed on another possible tool \u2014 yield curve control \u2014 that could put a cap on longer-term rates. At their June meeting, Fed officials kept the benchmark federal funds rate in a range of 0% to 0.25% and put out a projection showing officials expect the rate to remain steady until 2023. Officials also agreed to keep asset purchase, which have included Treasurys and agency mortgage-backed securities, at least at the current pace of $120 billion per month. U.S. stocks DJIA, +0.56% were little changed after the publication of the minutes on Wednesday. At their meeting, \u201ca number\u201d of Fed officials judged that there was a substantial chance of additional \u201cwaves of outbreaks\u201d of the coronavirus. Another source of risk was that fiscal help for households, businesses, and state and local governments might prove insufficient. At the June meeting, the Fed staff downgraded their projection for the economy from their prior forecast in April based on how the pandemic was evolving. The staff said their pessimistic forecast of a second wave of coronavirus outbreak later this year and subsequent economic damage was just as plausible as the more benign baseline forecast. Fed officials said there were signs that consumer spending was stabilizing or rebounding modestly right before their June 9-10 meeting. Spending was expected to improve starting in July but \u201cwas not expected to be particularly rapid\u201d beyond this year. Voluntary social distancing, precautionary saving and lower levels of employment and income would restrain the pace of expansion over the next 18 months or two years, the Fed said. Fiscal policy would have to play important roles to ensure a strong recovery, officials said. Officials were wary of the stronger-than-expected May job report, saying that it was too soon to draw firm conclusions about whether April was the trough of the recession. \u201cOverall Fed officials expected that a full recovery in employment would take some time,\u201d the minutes said. Even though some economists worry about rising inflation will be the ultimate result of the pandemic, Fed officials said the lockdown will be disinflationary. Fed officials noted that the central bank will have to keep monetary policy highly easy for some time to achieve their 2% inflation target."}]}
