Your pandemic holiday travel questions, answered", "body": "It may be safest to skip this year\u2019s family holiday gathering if possible, public-health experts say \u2014 but the decision is a personal one, and there are ways to minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission if you choose to forge ahead. Fifty-three percent of consumers say their family holiday get-togethers will proceed amid the pandemic, but 47% say their get-togethers will be canceled, according to a recent Morning Consult survey of 2,212 U.S. adults; 74% say they\u2019ll be having a smaller gathering than usual. Meanwhile, 68% say they\u2019ll be traveling less than usual for the holidays, with most people reporting they aren\u2019t planning to travel for or around Thanksgiving (75%) or any winter holidays (72%). M. Kit Delgado, an assistant professor of emergency medicine and epidemiology at the University of Pennsylvania, said traveling to family festivities this holiday season presented medium-level risk at best \u2014 and \u201ccan very easily be high-risk.\u201d Sitting out this year\u2019s big family gathering can help keep everyone safe \u2014 especially vulnerable family members \u2014 and avoid overburdening hospitals during flu season, he said. \u201cUnfortunately, the merriment we crave \u2014 eating, drinking and singing together in a cozy room \u2014 are among the highest-risk scenarios for transmitting COVID-19,\u201d Delgado told MarketWatch. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic that things will be different next year, and we can give up this year as an act of charity to our friends, family and community.\u201d But while it might be ideal to forgo holiday travel and gatherings, the decision is also a risk-benefit calculation that people have to make for themselves, said Sandra Albrecht, a Columbia University assistant professor of epidemiology and chief epidemiologist for the science-communication project Dear Pandemic. After all, seeing family members is important to many people, and mental-health problems have proliferated during the coronavirus crisis, Albrecht pointed out. And if this feels like the last Thanksgiving you might have with an elderly relative, for example, that would likely factor into your plans. \u201cThe benefit of seeing that family member could outweigh the risk,\u201d she said, \u201cbut you\u2019d have to assess the whole slew of risks involved.\u201d Ultimately, there\u2019s no straightforward answer as to whether you should travel for the holidays, she said, because there are a number of factors to consider in evaluating risk. But Albrecht, Delgado and other experts provided a framework for reducing risk if you do decide to head to your folks\u2019 place. (There are also charts that can help guide you.) Here are some questions to ask yourself: \u201c A positive test result, of course, means you should scrap your plans to see family. But a negative result isn\u2019t a license to abandon precautions. \u201d Are you at higher risk for COVID-19 complications? What about the people you\u2019re visiting? If you or a family member falls into one of the groups most severely impacted by the virus \u2014 people who are older than 65, have underlying health conditions and/or have weakened immune systems \u2014 you should be even more vigilant. \u201cUntil a vaccine\u2019s available, I would say most people who will fall into those categories should shy away from those visits for the holidays,\u201d said Karl Minges, an assistant professor of health administration and policy at the University of New Haven.Where are you coming from? And where are you going? Be aware of the coronavirus infection rate in your own area, as well as in the area you\u2019re traveling to, said Usama Bilal, an assistant professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at Drexel University. Check state quarantine requirements for visitors, he added; some states also require virus testing. Consider too whether your destination is home to a lot of people at heightened risk for severe COVID-19 infection, such as elderly people, Bilal said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t only you and your family \u2014 it\u2019s the community,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are infected and you go visit family, there\u2019s a risk that could lead to an outbreak for people beyond your family.\u201dCan you get tested, self-isolate and/or get your flu shot before traveling? If you\u2019ve been in a variety of environments in which virus transmission might have occurred, getting a COVID-19 test can provide some extra reassurance, Minges said. Albrecht, acknowledging the barriers to testing access and long turnaround times for some people, also advocated for getting tested at multiple points on your journey if possible \u2014 perhaps before traveling, after reaching your destination but before seeing family members, and again upon your return. A positive test result, of course, means you should scrap your plans to see family. But a negative result isn\u2019t a license to abandon precautions, Albrecht said, since testing too early can lead to false negatives that give a false sense of security. Continue wearing a mask, practicing social distancing and washing your hands. Delgado also recommended self-isolating as much as possible for at least two weeks prior to the trip. Get your flu shot before you go. \u201c \u2018Have a shared plan about what the visit is going to look like \u2014 do what\u2019s comfortable to you; do what\u2019s comfortable to the relative who you\u2019re visiting.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Karl Minges, an assistant professor of health administration and policy at the University of New Haven Who else is going? How many people will be there? Holidays typically attract large gatherings, which tend to be associated with higher COVID-19 transmission levels, Albrecht said. So you\u2019d ideally want fewer people gathering than usual, and it\u2019s even better if they\u2019re people already in your \u201cbubble.\u201d The risk level also depends on attendees\u2019 social contacts and exposures over the preceding couple of weeks, Delgado said. Gathering two groups of people that had completely self-isolated in their homes for two weeks presents far lower risk, he said, than hosting family members from all over the country who have kids in school and travel by train or plane to their destination. At the gathering, maximize distance between people, minimize density, and limit the duration of time spent together as much as possible, Delgado added. \u201cPeople don\u2019t always have the privilege of living in housing conditions that are not crowded, but certainly having more space indoors and allowing for less crowding is helpful,\u201d Albrecht said.Is everyone feeling OK? This goes without saying, but anyone with symptoms should self-isolate at home and abstain from participating in the event, Delgado said. Even a child\u2019s runny nose or low-grade fever could be cause for concern, Minges said.Can you set boundaries and expectations ahead of time? \u201cHave a shared plan about what the visit is going to look like \u2014 do what\u2019s comfortable to you; do what\u2019s comfortable to the relative who you\u2019re visiting,\u201d Minges said. \u201cCome up with a plan that you\u2019re both OK with, keeping in mind the public-health precautions.\u201d It\u2019s fine to draw boundaries for how the visit will go, he said. And while this might feel awkward, it\u2019s also OK to ask family members how they\u2019ve been protecting themselves from infection, Minges added. \u201cIf they haven\u2019t, you have a right to say, \u2018We\u2019re not visiting,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI would be cautious from visiting family members who have not been following precautions at this stage.\u201d \u201c A brief 30-minute encounter with someone who lives close by presents a far lower risk than staying over for a week and having multiple indoor encounters. \u201d How are you getting there? \u201cDrive your own car if possible to the event,\u201d Delgado said. \u201cIf traveling in public transportation, mask use and hand hygiene is critical.\u201d Each travel mode carries a different level of risk and exposure to other people, Albrecht said, as does the duration of travel. A long train ride will come with higher risk than driving a short distance.How long will you be there? Do you have to spend the night? \u201cBe together for a short amount of time to minimize exposure,\u201d Delgado said. A brief 30-minute encounter with someone who lives close by presents a far lower risk than staying over for a week and having multiple indoor encounters. Albrecht agreed that \u201cthe ideal is to be staying elsewhere.\u201d But if you have no other option, it\u2019s best to sleep and stay in an isolated area of the home, Minges said, ideally a dedicated space not close to the rest of the dwelling that has its own bathroom.Is it warm enough to gather outdoors? If not, can you improve ventilation? While holding the event outdoors would be ideal for reducing transmission risk, that might not be feasible in the cold weather cloaking much of the U.S. later in the year, Albrecht said. Try to improve indoor air flow through strategies like opening windows or using air purifiers. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get the level of risk down to zero, but you can do these small things to help decrease the likelihood of transmission,\u201d she said.Will everyone be wearing a mask? What will you do at meal time? Always wear a mask around people you don\u2019t live with, Delgado said, and wear a mask indoors at all times. Removing your mask to eat or drink while talking \u201cimmediately becomes a high-risk situation,\u201d he said; do so in a way that minimizes close interaction with folks outside your household. Try staggering eating times so that people from the same household can eat together at the same table, Delgado said. Consider eating with spaced-out seating, Albrecht added, and saving conversation for before or after the meal. \u201cPerhaps you would want to eat in separate areas of the house, just to allow for the greatest amount of air flow when you\u2019re not wearing a mask,\u201d Minges said. \u201cMake the whole house your dining room, if you can.\u201dCan you save that hug for next year? \u201cThe lowest risk would be to not hug,\u201d Albrecht said. \u201cThat said, there are lots of benefits derived from hugging.\u201d Consider whether you or the other person are at high COVID-19 risk, your respective comfort levels, and what you can do to minimize the risk of transmission, she said: A hug between two mask wearers carries less risk than a hug between two unmasked people. To avoid hurt feelings, include shows of affection in your boundary-setting discussion prior to the visit, Albrecht suggested \u2014 especially if you have family members who don\u2019t agree on the need for such precautions. \u201cThis can be a touchy subject,\u201d she said, \u201cand I can see family members being offended by a loved one saying they don\u2019t want to hug or kiss because of COVID.\u201d"}]}
