Under the initial benefit package in March, some workers received as much as $600 per week in addition to their regular benefits, which critics say encouraged the jobless to not look for work. \"You can assume it will be no more than 100%, so yes, we want to incent people to go back to work,\" Mnuchhin said in an interview on CNBC. Mnuchin said he and Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, talked with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Wednesday and their goal was to pass the next coronavirus aid bill between July 20th and the end of the month."}]}
