U.S. stock indexes traded sharply lower, poised to erase their gains for the week. Sharp losses in the stock market can send traders scrambling to cover losses by selling other assets, such as gold. Read:Dow slumps with stocks on pace to erase weekly gains This \u201cjumpy\u201d gold price and market is \u201cgoing to grind the emotion of traders, on both sides of the market in the coming weeks,\u201d said Peter Spina, who is president of GoldSeek.com and SilverSeek.com, providers of news and analysis for the precious metals. He told MarketWatch that he sees strong support in the $1,900 area for gold prices, and believes the metal will \u201csoon again try to push back up\u201d towards $2,000. For now, December gold GCZ20, +2.17% GC00, +2.17% fell $6.90, or nearly 0.4%, to settle at $1,937.80 an ounce. That was the lowest finish for a most-active contract since Aug. 27, according to FactSet data. Prices declined by 1.7% on Wednesday. December silver SIZ20, +5.96% SI00, +5.96%, meanwhile, dropped 52 cents, or 1.9%, at $26.875, following its 4.4% skid in the previous session. Gold had struggled for direction early Thursday, pressured by a fall in weekly U.S. jobless claims, but had also found some support from data showing a monthly jump in the U.S. trade deficit. \u201cThe U.S. jobless claims number was \u201cbetter but the trade balance data was really awful,\u201d said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at AvaTrade. Initial jobless claims fell by 130,000 to a seasonally adjusted 881,000 in the last week of August, the Labor Department said Thursday. Government data, however, revealed that the trade deficit jumped 18.9% in July owing to a big snapback in imports. Gold is still trading above $1,900 and \u201cthis is keeping the hope alive for the price to target the $2,000 mark,\u201d Aslam told MarketWatch. The \u201cbiggest risk event for the gold rally\u201d is Friday\u2019s U.S nonfarm payrolls data and \u201conly a strong reading can break the back\u201d of a gold rally. Meanwhile, \u201cthe U.S. dollar index has fallen significantly over the last five months,\u201d said Spina. \u201cShould there be stronger economic data as we move into the Fall, then this will help spur a rally in the U.S. dollar from these oversold conditions.\u201d A strong dollar \u201ccould put a bit of pressure on the gold price and keep it in a sideways market near $2,000,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that is just short-term noise. The bigger picture is what is important and those fundamental drivers are significantly in gold\u2019s favor.\u201d In Thursday dealings, the U.S. dollar traded little changed, as gauged by the ICE U.S. dollar index DXY, -0.58%, a measure of the buck\u2019s strength against a half-dozen currencies. After touching a two-year low, the index has gained 0.5% so far this week. Gold, which is priced in dollars, often trades inversely with the dollar, as moves in the U.S. unit can influence the attractiveness of the metal to holders of other currencies. For now, gold is in a \u201chealthy consolidation phase after a quick price run-up,\u201d Spina said. \u201cGold is priming for its next move above $2,000 to fresh record highs.\u201d Given all that, Spina believes \u201cthis is an excellent time to be accumulating, specifically the miners,\u201d pointing out that they are \u201ctrading very cheaply compared to historic ratios, they have yet to catch up to even these new higher prices.\u201d However, growing expectations for a vaccine or effective remedies against the COVID-19 pandemic, also have weighed on precious metals\u2019 pricing lately, experts say. Bullion has been boosted by economic uncertainty stoked by the pandemic and by the outsize monetary efforts implemented by central bank\u2019s to stem the harm to business activity across the world, but a cure or treatment for the deadly disease could dislodge gold from its bullish perch. \u201cIf a vaccine is imminent, it is safe to assume that central bankers will take their foot off the policy accelerator,\u201d wrote Stephen Innes, chief global markets strategist at AxiCorp, in a daily note. Among other metals traded on Comex, December copper HGZ20, +1.38% fell 1.5% to $2.975 a pound. October platinum PLV20, +3.99% fell 1.6% to $889.60 an ounce, but December palladium PAZ20, +2.31% added 2.4% to $2,321.60 an ounce."}]}
