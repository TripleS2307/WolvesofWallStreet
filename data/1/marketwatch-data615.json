Not all financial advisers and investment professionals say it\u2019s the best choice when saving for retirement. Vanguard Group defended the strategy in a recent note to its clients, saying the asset allocation allows investors and their portfolios to combat volatility \u2014 such as during the current global pandemic. The 60/40 rule dictates 60% of the portfolio is invested in stocks and 40% in bonds or other \u201csafe\u201d classes. Read:Vanguard comes to the defense of the 60/40 portfolio Comparatively, some financial services firms, such as Bank of America BAC, have said the 60/40 rule is essentially dead. In a research note published last year called \u201cThe End of 60/40,\u201d Bank of America portfolio strategists said \u201cthere are good reasons to reconsider the role of bonds in your portfolio.\u201d Instead, investors should focus more of their attention on equities. See:Retirees should consider today\u2019s most unpopular investment \u2014 here\u2019s why Reconsidering the 60/40 construction can be a good idea for some investors. \u201cIt is a good core portfolio that has stood the test of time, but considering the current interest rate environment, the use of a much more highly diversified portfolio makes more sense to mitigate risk and create more consistent expected returns for investors,\u201d said Thomas Rindahl, a financial adviser at Truwest Wealth Management Services. 80% of older Americans can't afford to retire - COVID-19 isn't helping The investments within equities and bonds are also crucial to determining just how effective it is in protecting investors from steep declines while still growing. Bond exposure alone isn\u2019t enough to hedge against major volatility, said Matthew McKay, an investment analyst at Briaud Financial Advisors. Treasury Bonds would be beneficial, but corporate bonds or asset-backed securities are typically included in selloffs in a panic. There\u2019s also no inflation protection, or no holdings in commodities. The strategy is also generic, and doesn\u2019t take into account personal needs and factors, including age, spending, amount already saved, and other expected retirement income, such as Social Security or pensions, said Larry Luxenberg, a principal at Lexington Avenue Capital Management. \u201cEveryone should think about asset allocation but where they end up is an individual matter,\u201d he said. Instead of restricting a portfolio to just two asset classes \u2014 stocks and bonds \u2014 investors should look at those as well as other asset classes. \u201cI argue that investing based on age or expected retirement, while only considering two types of assets (stocks and bonds) is a bit thoughtless,\u201d McKay said. The bucket approach may be better, which divides portfolios into \u201cbuckets\u201d for various goals that are invested differently to achieve those aspirations, said Marguerita Cheng, chief executive officer of Blue Ocean Global Wealth. \u201cSixty-forty isn\u2019t necessarily dead per se, but cookie cutter or template models may not work because not everyone\u2019s situation is the same,\u201d she said. Also see: It took decades for me to retire \u2018wealthy\u2019 \u2014 should I feel guilty? Still, it\u2019s a good starting point. The 60/40 rule is also known as the \u201cGoldilocks Portfolio,\u201d said Mackenzie Richards, a financial planner at SK Wealth Management. \u201cNot too risky, but not overly safe,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething that will allow a retiree to keep pace with the increasing cost of living.\u201d During volatility, having the presence of bonds in a portfolio still prevents such steep declines from blows to equities, said Herschel Clanton, president of Chancellor Wealth Management. \u201cThe 60/40 portfolio still has value,\u201d he said. Some experts may be saying the portfolio strategy is dead because the bull market is over, which weakens the 60% portion of the allocation, and interest rates are low, which hinders the steady income from the 40% side, Richards added. But that\u2019s a nearsighted perspective, he said. \u201cThese market prophets tend to focus on the short-term situation, failing to think about the different market cycles that a retiree is going to experience over the rest of their lifetime,\u201d he said. \u201cWith these cycles, as we have seen over the past 100 years, there is going to be fluctuation in stock prices as well as interest rates.\u201d"}]}
