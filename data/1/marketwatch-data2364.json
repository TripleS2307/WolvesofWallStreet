Monday\u2019s upbeat market action contrasted with a further spike in U.S. coronavirus cases and a resurgence of business restrictions by state and local authorities struggling to contain the viral outbreak. How did benchmarks perform? The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% gained 459.67 points, or 1.8%, to end at 26,287.03. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% climbed 49.71 points, or 1.6%, ending at 3,179.72 and booking five straight sessions of gains, its longest streak since Dec. 17, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.39% surged 226.02 points, or 2.2%, to 10,433.65, scoring a fresh closing record. The Dow finished last week\u2019s holiday-shortened period up 3.3%, the S&P 500 put in a weekly gain of 4%, while the Nasdaq returned 4.6%, after closing at a record on Thursday. The U.S. market was closed on Friday in observance of the Independence Day holiday. What drove the market? U.S. stocks ended up sharply Monday, led by shares of financial companies and record-setting technology shares as Wall Street followed Chinese equity markets higher. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, -0.21% share advanced 5.1%, leading the blue-chip Dow higher, along with Boeing Co. BA, -0.39% and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. WBA, -1.96%. But Monday\u2019s gains also came with growing doubts about the ability of the U.S. to contain the viral outbreak and its economic fallout, after COVID-19 cases climbed across the U.S. over the Fourth of July weekend. Coronavirus update: U.S. cases reach 2.9 million and death toll tops 130K, as 38 states see cases on the climb \u201cThis is potentially setting the U.S. on a very different activity restart path than most Western countries and much of Asia,\u201d warned a BlackRock Investment Institute team led by Mike Pyle, global chief investment strategist, in a note Monday. The BlackRock team lauded the coordinated U.S. fiscal and monetary response in March, but they also warned that the \u201cresurgence of the virus is taking place just as Congress and the White House face a critical decision over whether to extend a number of crisis measures, including additional federal unemployment benefits set to expire at the end of July.\u201d Kristina Hooper, Invesco\u2019s chief global market strategist, also warned that recent improvements on the U.S. jobless front and surprisingly better economic data could be derailed in the coming months if policy makers become complacent in their response to rising COVID-19 infections. \u201cIn my view, more fiscal stimulus is clearly needed as so much of the stimulus already enacted is very temporary in nature,\u201d Hooper wrote in a client note. \u201cIn addition, we are seeing a growing number of companies announce layoffs and file for bankruptcies while others are voluntarily re-closing stores.\u201d In U.S. economic data, the Institute for Supply Management reported its index of service sector companies jumped to 57.1 in June from 45.4 in May, marking the single-biggest increase since the survey was created in 1997. MarketWatch-polled economists expected to see a reading of 51. Any number above 50 represents an expansion in economic activity. Yet, there were doubts about the sustainability of the positive sentiments. \u201cThousands of retail shops and bars and restaurants are closing, or soon will be, after the coronavirus pandemic stopped the flow of traffic and crashed sales and revenues and tipped many businesses into financial bankruptcy and, yet, purchasing managers say the outlook for the service sector is looking up,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist for MUFG. Read: Skyrocketing of COVID-19 cases around the U.S. slows dine-in restaurant recovery Market bulls have been attributing rising stocks to optimism around a sharp, or V-shaped, economic recovery in the U.S., as well as Asia, in no small part due to global fiscal and monetary stimulus that helped markets recover from the depths of their mid-March selloff. Beyond the rise in U.S. infections, optimism reflected in equities on Monday also comes despite economists at Goldman Sachs lowering their already downbeat forecast for U.S. domestic growth in 2020 to negative 4.6%, from a previous forecast for a 4.2% drop, pointing to the reimposition of COVID-19 restrictions on business activity. For 2021, the bank is sticking to its forecast for growth to rebound 5.8%. In Asian hours Monday, Chinese shares jumped, with the flagship Shanghai Composite SHCOMP, +1.67% finishing up 5.7%, to the highest level since 2018 and the CSI 300 Index 000300, +2.04% booking a similar return, after a front-page editorial in state-owned paper, China Securities Journal, said fostering a \u201chealthy bull market\u201d is important, according to a translation. The move higher in stocks came as China continued to fends off sanctions and criticism about its decision to impose a national-security law in Hong Kong, a crackdown that has drawn the rebuke of several countries, including the U.S. and Canada. Which stocks were in focus? Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A, +0.06% BRK.B, +0.24% agreed to buy natural-gas transmission and storage assets from Dominion Energy D, -0.34% for about $10 billion including debt, after the investor had refrained from buying assets during the public-health crisis so far.
