Morgan downgrades Moderna over valuation concerns", "body": "Analysts at J.P. Morgan downgraded shares of Moderna Inc. MRNA, +0.09% to neutral from overweight over concerns about the valuation of the preclinical company, which has never produced an approved product. Moderna is developing a COVID-19 vaccine candidate that is widely considered one of the frontrunners to bring a vaccine to market; it was the first company to share data about how its experimental vaccine performed in a Phase 1 clinical trial. The company's shares, which were up 2.5% in premarket trading on Monday, have soared 384.9% since the start of the year. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.87%, in comparison, is down 0.2% for the year. \"This stock move itself isn't entirely surprising given the rapid execution on mRNA-1273, the tremendous widespread investor interest on this program, and the obvious unmet need/opportunity for a COVID-19 vaccine,\" they wrote in a note Monday. \"That said, at these levels we are having difficulty justifying more upside given the uncertainty of the duration/characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic.\""}]}
