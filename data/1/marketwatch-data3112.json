In the U.S., we also reengaged more than one million past customers who had been absent from the platform for longer than 12 months.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wayfair reported second-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $3.13 after a loss of $1.35 last year. Revenue jumped nearly 84% to $4.3 billion. And orders delivered was up 106.2% to 18.9 million. Wayfair stock has more than tripled for the year to date, up 246%. The Amplify Online Retail ETF IBUY, +1.39% \u00c2 is up 78.3%. And the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% \u00c2 has gained 3.7% for the period. As COVID-19 spread, lockdowns have forced people to spend more time at home, driving sales at those retailers and brands that specialize in home goods. Work-from-home and homeschooling has given sales of office items, computers and other related items a boost as well.

Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as confident. He attributes much of the sales boost to the fact that many stores were closed during the pandemic, and questions whether the soaring sales are sustainable. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom our data, consumers have already started to return to physical stores and online penetration levels in furniture and home furnishings have dropped from their peak in April,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile we believe online sales will remain elevated in home related categories \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which will be helpful to Wayfair \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the trends of this quarter will not be repeated indefinitely.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Also:The back-to-school shopping season will be a \u00e2\u0080\u0098dud\u00e2\u0080\u0099 one analyst says, but the NRF is forecasting a record breaker There are also concerns about the competition. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA lot of retailers are now investing more in digital and this inevitably means that online competition in home will rise over the next few years,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Saunders said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis will place even more pressure on Wayfair to maintain market share which possibly means higher spending on advertising and customer acquisition: the very thing that it cannot afford.\u00e2\u0080\u009d UBS analysts led by Michael Lasser are more confident. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe believe Wayfair could see a long tail of wallet share gains,\u00e2\u0080\u009d UBS said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTravel spend is unlikely to return to pre-pandemic levels any time soon. Meanwhile, consumers are likely to allocate more dollars to home furnishings and use e-commerce as the preferred channel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d UBS rates Wayfair stock neutral with a $325 price target up sharply from the previous price target of $170. Canaccord Genuity analysts led by Maria Ripps agree. In addition, the company made logistical improvements to keep up with the surge in demand. Wayfair added 1,000 customer service workers, enlisted new suppliers and took other steps to keep challenges to a minimum. Watch:Work from home is here to stay. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what it means for retail \u00e2\u0080\u009cWayfair\u00e2\u0080\u0099s model is exhibiting signs of strong scale and leverage as the platform remains well-positioned to take advantage of this heightened demand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Canaccord said. Canaccord rates Wayfair stock buy with a $340 price target, up from $300. CFRA upgraded Wayfair to buy from hold and moved its price target to $350 from $170."}]}
