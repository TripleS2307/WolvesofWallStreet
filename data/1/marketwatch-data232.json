Or perhaps it was simple irony on display when,\u00c2 Washington Post\u00c2 reporters wrote, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPresident Trump contracted the novel coronavirus after months in which he and people around him\u00e2\u0080\u00a6avoided taking basic steps to prevent the virus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spread.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u201c What does Oedipus learn in the course of the drama? Quite a lot. He may blame the gods or fate for his plight, but he also takes responsibility for what has happened. \u201d All these reactions make sense. If there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one thing we know about a virus that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still mysterious in many ways, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that this coronavirus is expert at going around. And as a classics scholar, I can assure you: What goes around comes around. Greek mythology provides insight to help us understand today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chaos.Failure to see until too late Many years ago, my high school English teachers put a lot of stress on terms like foreshadowing, climax and denouement. All these words marked points along a steep curve of the development of a story: rising action, turning point, falling action. There was also a lot of emphasis, as we discussed plots, on a term I then found harder to understand: pride. Pride: arrogance; an exaggerated sense of self-worth. Pride tended to be followed by catastrophe\u00e2\u0080\u0094that falling action again. As a high-school student, I tended to confuse pride with vanity, with narcissistic preening; the tragic penalty of vanity seemed exaggeratedly severe. What does \u00e2\u0080\u009cpride\u00e2\u0080\u009d really mean?\u00c2 The Greek word it translates is hubris, and pride doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite cover the range of the meaning of hubris. Vanity may well be part of hubris, but a more crucial sense of the word is terrible judgment, gross overconfidence, blindness, obtuseness, a failure to see what is staring you in the face\u00e2\u0080\u0094a failure to see it until it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too late. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t recall my teachers mentioning\u00c2 nemesis\u00c2 or\u00c2 at\u00c3\u00a9, forces or principles that are closely associated with hubris in Greek mythology. Nemesis is more often personified, and hence capitalized, than at\u00c3\u00a9. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a goddess of retribution, and she can follow acts of hubris with the certainty of a law of gravity\u00e2\u0080\u0094except that there may be a considerable time lag, as if one dropped a plate and it took a generation for it to break. That concept likewise\u00c2 appears in the Bible\u00e2\u0080\u0099s book of Ezekiel, which says \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the teeth of the children shall be set on edge.\u00e2\u0080\u009d At\u00c3\u00a9 is a more unpredictable figure, not necessarily personified\u00e2\u0080\u0094classics scholar E.R. Dodds in \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Greeks and the Irrational\u00e2\u0080\u009d tentatively defines at\u00c3\u00a9 as \u00e2\u0080\u009ca sort of guilty rashness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d On the other hand, at\u00c3\u00a9 can be unforgettably personified, as when\u00c2 Mark Antony addresses the body of Caesar and predicts civil war\u00c2 in Shakespeare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cJulius Caesar:\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd Caesar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spirit ranging for revenge,With At\u00c3\u00a9 by his side, come hot from hell,Shall in these confines, with a monarch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice,Cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d Goddess or not, at\u00c3\u00a9, like nemesis, can be thought of as a kind of mechanism whereby one evil is succeeded by another. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a chain reaction, a cause and result. Nemesis seems cooler, more targeted and precise; at\u00c3\u00a9 lets all hell break loose, and also is the hell that breaks loose. Categories blur in the chaos.\u00e2\u0080\u0098He himself is the polluter\u00e2\u0080\u0099 When I studied and taught Sophocles\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tragedy \u00e2\u0080\u009cOedipus the King,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the stress was on hubris, irony, blindness. What wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t emphasized is that the\u00c2 play was written during and is set in the midst of a plague. The citizens of Thebes, in the tragedy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opening scene, implore their wise and resourceful ruler Oedipus to save them from this disastrous illness. Oedipus, moved by their plight and confident in his own capability, promises to do exactly that. His effort to hunt down the criminal whose unpunished sin is polluting the city and causing the plague leads to Oedipus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own exposure as the source of that pollution. But he persists in his hunt for the truth\u00e2\u0080\u0094even though the truth, as every student learns, turns out to be that he himself is the polluter whom he seeks. Trump, like Oedipus, is the source of the pollution\u00e2\u0080\u0094or at the very least, a vector, a spreader, an enabler. Unlike Oedipus, the president has actively discouraged the hunt for the truth. The final words of the tragedy are addressed by the chorus to the citizens of Thebes. Presumably the plague will be routed; the city has indeed been cleansed. In contrast, the citizens of our country keep on dying. The president removes his mask and proclaims his triumph. Aristotle recommends in his \u00e2\u0080\u009cPoetics\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2 that in the best tragedies, the pivot or reversal\u00e2\u0080\u0094called \u00e2\u0080\u009cperipeteia\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094from the height of success to disaster is accompanied by some kind of knowledge\u00e2\u0080\u0094anagnorisis, or recognition. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPathei mathos,\u00e2\u0080\u009d sings the chorus in\u00c2 Aeschylus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tragedy \u00e2\u0080\u009cAgamemnon\u00e2\u0080\u009d: wisdom comes through suffering. The simultaneity of Oedipus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enlightenment and his catastrophe is one of the factors that made Aristotle so admire this elegantly plotted play. The untranslatable, chaotic force of at\u00c3\u00a9 plays out in the cycle of reversal followed by recognition; arrogance followed by retribution. What are we supposed to think? Whether we rejoice or mourn, whether we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re elated or fearful, and whatever happens in the weeks and months to come, this news\u00e2\u0080\u0094that the president has COVID-19\u00e2\u0080\u0094arrives with a freight of predictability: This particular infection seems, in retrospect, if not inevitable then at least overwhelmingly likely. Hubris: not seeing what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in front of your nose.\u00c2 Even as lawsuits\u00c2 and\u00c2 tell-all books\u00c2 have piled up, Trump has always seemed triumphantly immune. Not any more.Tragedy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lesson What happens next? Unlike Oedipus, Trump has denied that there was ever a dangerous illness in the city\u00e2\u0080\u0094although\u00c2 Bob Woodward\u00e2\u0080\u0099s book, \u00e2\u0080\u009cRage\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2 makes clear that he knew there was. Unlike Oedipus, he has refused his people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pleas for help. What does Oedipus learn in the course of the drama? Quite a lot. He may blame the gods or fate for his plight, but he also takes responsibility for what has happened. What will COVID\u00e2\u0080\u0094his own personal, irrefutable experience of COVID-19\u00e2\u0080\u0094teach Trump? Humility? Compassion? Respect for expert advice? The existence of Nemesis? His own diagnosis of hubris, with a measure of at\u00c3\u00a9 thrown in? The answer is all too clear. Released from the hospital,\u00c2 Trump tweeted: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be afraid of Covid. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let it dominate your life!\u00e2\u0080\u009d He also said \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaybe I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m immune\u00e2\u0080\u009d and took off his mask when returning to the White House. Tragedy, I tell my students, doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t teach a lesson or preach a moral. It offers a vision. Not: don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be arrogant, prideful, hubristic. Rather: Men of Thebes, look upon Oedipus. Rachel Hadas is a professor of English at Rutgers University Newark.
