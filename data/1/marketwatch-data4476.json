Some improvement in U.S. economic data and comments from a White House officials helped to calm traders\u2019 nerves over the short-term prospects for the economy. \u201cA big jump in durable goods and assurances by White House Economic Advisor Larry Kudlow that the U.S. was not going to shut the economy down gave us a boost,\u201d said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at The Price Futures Group. \u201cCornavirus fears had been driving us lower, but...Kudlow reminded the market to put the coronavirus data in perspective and focus on the positive signs that are coming out of recent economic data,\u201d he told MarketWatch. Orders for durable goods in the U.S. jumped 15.8% in May, better than the 10.3% rise expected by economists polled by MarketWatch. Weekly initial jobless claims, meanwhile, fell slightly to 1.48 million from 1.54 million a week earlier.

DIS, +1.53%, reclosing or delaying re-opening businesses. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said Thursday he is pausing the reopening of the state as it responds to a spike in cases of COVID-19 and hospitalizations. Delaying re-openings is \u201cnot attractive for oil traders who have been counting on improving demand,\u201d Flynn wrote in a Thursday morning report. Commodity experts also said that a grim outlook for the global economy from the International Monetary Fund published Wednesday weighed on oil sentiment. The IMF sees a global economic contraction of 4.9%, almost 2 percentage points lower than three months ago. \u201cWe are definitely not out of the woods. We have not escaped the great lockdown,\u201d said Gita Gopinath, the IMF\u2019s chief economist, at a press briefing. However, weak oil demand is not expected to be the main factor impacting oil prices this year, according to he Economist Intelligence Unit. Earlier price declines were largely driven by concerns that \u201crising U.S. stockpiles pointed to slowing GDP growth and a potential [domestic] supply glut,\u201d Cailin Birch, global economist at EIU, told MarketWatch.

It also revealed that total domestic oil production climbed by 500,000 barrels a day to 11 million barrels a day. On the production side, global \u201coutput remains fairly restrained,\u201d and Saudi Arabia and other members of Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will \u201clargely stick to their production cut agreement in 2020, in the interest of avoiding another price crash,\u201d said Birch. She also pointed out that U.S. crude production has fallen by nearly 20% between the start of March and the start of June, \u201cwiping out nearly two years of production gains.\u201d Birch expects the current \u201cpush-and-pull\u201d factors in the oil market ton continue to offset each other in the coming months, keeping Brent prices roughly within a range of $35 to $45 in the second half of this year. Natural-gas futures settled sharply lower after the EIA reported Thursday that domestic supplies of the commodity rose by 120 billion cubic feet for the week ended June 19. That was more than the average increase of 107 billion forecast by analysts polled by S&P Global Platts. July natural gas US:NGN20 fell 7.2% to $1.482 per million British thermal units.
