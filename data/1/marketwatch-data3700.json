The standard window of theatrical exclusivity typically runs about 90 days. Up until now, the largest chains have steadfastly refused to screen films that don\u2019t give releases a lengthy and exclusive run in theaters before moving onto video-on-demand or streaming services. Studios, meanwhile, have increasingly sought to deliver new movies more quickly into the home. The new deal covers Universal films \u2014 which include the \u201cFast & Furious\u201d franchise, \u201cJurassic Park\u201d movies and the \u201cDespicable Me\u201d series \u2014 in the U.S. over the next three years. After a run of at least three weekends, Universal (and its specialty label, Focus Features) will have the option of steering a film to premium on-demand, including AMC\u2019s own service. The shortened window only applies to premium video-on-demand \u2014 which often means digital rentals of $20 \u2014 not standard on-demand or other home platforms. The deal has potentially profound ramifications for an industry reeling from the coronavirus pandemic. It\u2019s all but certain to lead other studios to press for similar terms from AMC and other exhibitors. Netflix, which hasn\u2019t been able to previously agree with major chains over briefer runs for its premier releases, could now find deals more palatable. If widely embraced, a three-week window would also put further pressure on independent theaters which tend to rely on longer runs for films. Adam Aron, chief executive of AMC Entertainment AMC, -2.17% , called it \u201ca historic, industry-changing agreement.\u201d The deal repairs a rift between AMC, the world\u2019s largest theater chain, and Universal, which is owned by Comcast Corp. CMCSA, -0.99% . In April, with theaters shuttered nationwide, Universal released the animated sequel \u201cTrolls World Tour\u201d by video on demand. NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell then trumpeted the digital release as a success and said the studio would, even once theaters reopened, \u201crelease movies on both formats.\u201d That infuriated theater owners. Aron said the company would no longer play Universal releases and claimed he would do the same for any distributor that \u201cunilaterally abandons current windowing practices absent good faith negotiations between us.\u201d Terms of the deal weren\u2019t disclosed, but AMC will get a share of the premium video-on-demand revenue. \u201cThe theatrical experience continues to be the cornerstone of our business,\u201d said Donna Langley, chairman of Universal Filmed Entertainment Group. \u201cThe partnership we\u2019ve forged with AMC is driven by our collective desire to ensure a thriving future for the film distribution ecosystem and to meet consumer demand with flexibility and optionality.\u201d Defending the impact at the box office, Aron said that the first three weeks of ticket sales is when \u201ca considerable majority of a movie\u2019s theatrical box office revenue typically is generated.\u201d The largest chains have been closed in the U.S. for more than four months, threatening their solvency. Exhibitors, including AMC, are currently planning on a large-scale reopening by late August, with Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cTenet\u201d prepared to usher moviegoers back over the Labor Day weekend, after debuting a week earlier overseas. Universal has opted to postpone its largest upcoming films \u2014 including \u201cF9\u201d and \u201cMinions\u201d \u2014 into next year. The studio sent \u201cThe King of Staten Island\u201d directly to homes. Its next scheduled release expected in theaters is \u201cCandyman\u201d on Oct. 16. The National Association of Theater Owners, the trade organization that represents the country\u2019s theaters, declined to comment on the new deal."}]}
