That move disproportionately impacts technology companies that accounted for 66% of all H-1B visa holders in the U.S. in 2019, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The Trump administration issued the proclamation to create an estimated 525,000 more jobs for 20 million Americans who are unemployed amid the coronavirus pandemic, a senior official said late Monday. H-1B visas are different from other kinds of visas in that they are allotted to \u00e2\u0080\u009chighly educated foreign professionals to work in \u00e2\u0080\u0098specialty occupations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that require at least a bachelor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s degree or the equivalent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to the American Immigration Council, a non-profit based in Washington, D.C. that supports immigration into the U.S. Typically, these visas last for three years but could be extended to six, the AIC said. The median annual compensation for the 388,403 workers on H-1B visas was $98,000 in 2019, according to USCIS. Opponents of the visas, which were capped at 85,000 this year, hold that it drives down wages for U.S.-born workers.

Unemployment in the high-growth tech sector has been low compared to other sectors because workers on these visa have filled the skills gap that would otherwise exist if employers could only high U.S.-born workers, economists say.
