Initial jobless claims slowed to 1.54 million in the seven days ended June 6 from a revised 1.9 million at the end of May, the Labor Department said Thursday. The figures are seasonally adjusted. Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast 1.6 million new claims filed the usual way through state unemployment offices.

Before the pandemic paralyzed the U.S. economy in March, new claims were running in the low 200,000s and sat near a 50-year low. In a good sign that shows more workers are returning to their jobs, the number of people actually collecting traditional jobless benefits fell slightly in the week of May 30. These so-called continuing claims are reported with a one-week lag. What happened: Along with jobless claims filed the usual way, 705,676 applications were submitted under a temporary federal-relief program put in place after the pandemic began. Forty-two states reported figures for federal claims under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program. The federal law provides benefits for workers who were never eligible in the past, such as the self-employed, because they did not contribute to the joint state-federal unemployment fund like most companies do. That put the total number of new claims at an unadjusted 2.24 million in the first week of June, compared to 2.42 million in the prior week. To give a clearer picture of unemployment, MarketWatch is also reporting select jobless claims data using actual, or unadjusted, figures. The seasonally adjusted estimates typically expected by Wall Street have inflated jobless claims during the pandemic and become less accurate. Continuing claims filed through the states, meanwhile, slipped to an unadjusted 18.9 million in the week of May 30 from 19.1 million. That\u2019s down from a pandemic peak of nearly 23 million. See:Marketwatch\u2019s Coronavirus Economic Recovery Tracker. If all eight state and federal assistance programs are included, continuing claims totaled an unadjusted 29.5 million in the seven days ended May 23, the most recent data available. That marks a small drop from 30.2 million in the prior week.

The huge number of new claims, however, also overstates the damage. Millions of people have been returning to work as the economy reopens and there\u2019s likely been a lot of duplicative claims during the crisis owing to massive technology snafus at overwhelmed state employment offices. Still, the unemployment rate sits at a modern record high and many people are likely to find they don\u2019t have a job to return to, especially in businesses that rely on dense clusters of customers such as travel, entertainment and dining out.

What they are saying? \u201cContinuing claims have fallen in two of the past three weeks, and are down 16% from their peak in early May, as laid-off workers are recalled to their jobs,\u201d said chief economist Gus Faucher of PNC Financial Services. \u201cThe worst in the labor market appears to be over, but it is still in terrible condition from the viral recession.\u201d Market reaction:The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% and S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% fell sharply in Thursday trades. Stocks have been rising lately amid a raft of signals indicating the economy is starting to grow again, but a pessimistic outlook by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell dampened the optimism on Wall Street."}]}
