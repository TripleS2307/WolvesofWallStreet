A Huawei executive said this month that the company was running out of processor chips to make smartphones due to U.S. sanctions and that it might be forced to stop production of its own advanced chips. Huawei has been at the center of rising U.S.-Chinese tensions over technology and security. The standoff has now enveloped the popular Chinese-owned video app TikTok and China-based messaging service WeChat, both of which are under the threat of a ban in the U.S. starting in September. Huawei has repeatedly denied accusations it might facilitate Chinese spying. Chinese officials have accused Washington of using national security as an excuse to stop a competitor to U.S. tech industries. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Fox Business on Monday that the new action is enforcement-focused and not \u00e2\u0080\u009cdirectly related to the trade talks\u00e2\u0080\u009d between the U.S. and China. Washington cut off Huawei\u00e2\u0080\u0099s access to U.S. components and technology, including Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s music and other smartphone services, last year. Those penalties were tightened in May when the White House barred vendors worldwide from using U.S. technology to produce components for Huawei. The Commerce Department said Monday that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tightening restrictions because Huawei has \u00e2\u0080\u009ccontinuously tried to evade\u00e2\u0080\u009d them. The new rule is designed to block Huawei\u00e2\u0080\u0099s access to commercially available chips made with tools acquired from the U.S. The U.S. also added 38 Huawei affiliates to an existing list of companies banned from receiving some sensitive technologies. And it ended an exemption that had allowed some Huawei customers in the U.S. to keep using its equipment and software."}]}
