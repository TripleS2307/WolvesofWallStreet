The NIH added: \u201cThe data from this study indicate that this drug provided no additional benefit compared to placebo control for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients.\u201d Hydroxychloroquine, which has long been used to combat Malaria, was heralded by many, including President Trump, as a possible treatment option to the coronavirus pandemic until a working vaccine becomes available. Earlier this month the World Health Organization said it was temporarily halting its clinical trials that use hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 patients over published concerns that the drug may do more harm than good. The move came after the medical journal The Lancet reported in a controversial study that patients getting hydroxychloroquine were dying at higher rates than other coronavirus patients."}]}
