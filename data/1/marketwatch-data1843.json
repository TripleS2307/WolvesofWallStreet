Net income rose to $897.3 million, or $7.61 a share, from $193.1 million, or $1.68 a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share came to $7.16, above the FactSet consensus of $5.91. Revenue rose to $1.95 billion from $1.58 billion, topping the FactSet consensus of $1.73 billion, as product sales and Sanofi collaboration revenue beat expectations, while Bayer collaboration revenue fell a bit shy. \"We have advanced REGN-COV2, our antibody cocktail for COVID-19, into late-stage clinical studies in record time and are working to ensure supply is available later this year,\" said Chief Executive Leonard Schleifer.
