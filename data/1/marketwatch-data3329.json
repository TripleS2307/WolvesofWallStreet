FDX, +0.18% said late Friday it was taking about $370 million in impaired goodwill charges, most from assets acquired from the company's 2004 acquisition of Kinko's Inc. FedEx shares declined 0.5% after hours, following a 0.6% decline to close the regular session at $137.63. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, FedEx said it was taking a noncash charge of $348 million in the fourth quarter because of \"declining print revenue and temporary store closures\" at its FedEx Office and Print Services Inc. stores. The additional charges come from a goodwill impairment charge from FedEx's 2015 acquisition of Genco Distribution System Inc., now known as FedEx Supply Chain Distribution System Inc."}]}
