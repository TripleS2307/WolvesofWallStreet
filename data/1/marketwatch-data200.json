A strike in Norway also threatened to reduce production in the North Sea. As of Wednesday, 91.53% of Gulf oil production and 61.82% of natural-gas output were shut in as the hurricane churned in the Gulf of Mexico, according to the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia is considering the postponement of plans for the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to raise oil production early next year to the end of the first quarter, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, citing comments from senior Saudi oil advisers. They cited the rise in COVID-19 cases in many parts of the world, as well as the expected return of Libyan crude oil to the world market for rethinking the plan, the report said. OPEC and its allies, collectively known as OPEC+, had agreed to cut overall oil output by 9.7 million barrels per day starting in May. The group tapered the cuts starting in August to 7.7 million barrels per day. \u201cThe Saudi reluctance to raise output should solidify an oil bottom,\u201d Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at The Price Futures Group, told MarketWatch. With uncertainty surrounding a second wave of COVID-19 cases and the success that OPEC+ has had with output cuts, and with global supply tightening, \u201cwhy change course?\u201d West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery CLX20, -1.62% CL.1, -1.62% rose $1.24, or 3.1%, to settle at $41.19 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. December Brent crude BRNZ20, -0.07% BRN00, -0.07%, the global benchmark, added $1.35, or 3.2%, at $43.34 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe. Oil prices also got a boost amid a widening strike action could cut output in Norway, Western Europe\u2019s largest oil producer, by a quarter, operators said on Thursday, according to Reuters. The \u201cproblems on the supply side can no longer be ignored,\u201d said Carsten Fritsch, analyst at Commerzbank, in a note. \u201cThe strike in Norway could now also affect the country\u2019s largest oil field \u2013 Johan Sverdrup \u2014 which has a daily production capacity of 470,000 barrels,\u201d Fritsch said, in a note. If production was halted there, outages at all strike-affected oil fields would total 941,000 barrels per day, he said, noting the operator said production would need to be suspended if the strike, which began on Sept. 30, isn\u2019t resolved by Oct. 14. Among the petroleum products traded on Nymex, November gasoline RBX20, -2.11% rose 2.6% to $1.2316 a gallon and November heating oil HOX20, -0.05% added 2.7% to $1.1923 a gallon. Oil prices had posted a decline on Wednesday, partly due to a weekly rise in U.S. crude supplies and uncertainty surrounding U.S. fiscal stimulus plans in Congress. There were also concerns that that Hurricane Delta \u201cwould create massive demand destruction because of power outages and flooding,\u201d said Flynn, in a Thursday note. However, he believes that forecasts seem to suggest a weaker storm than previously indicated, so \u201cproduction and demand might come back faster than anticipated.\u201d Changes in demand linked to the pandemic have also been a concern for traders. In its World Oil Outlook report released Thursday, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said that while the pandemic has led to \u201chuge\u201d financial losses in the energy industry, \u201cthere have been signs of the market rebalancing after the colossal 23 [million barrel per day] contraction in oil demand in April 2020.\u201d The market, however, also has a \u201clong way to go to eliminate the huge stock overhang and for the markets to return to balance and stability,\u201d the report said. Read: OPEC expects oil to hold ground as the world\u2019s fuel of choice through 2045 Natural gas, meanwhile, will be the \u201cfastest-growing fossil fuel\u201d between 2019 and 2045, according to the OPEC report. Global demand for the fuel is expected to rise to 91 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2045, from nearly 67 mboe/d in 2019. On Nymex Thursday, November natural gas NGX20, +5.17% added 2 cents, or 0.8%, to $2.627 per million British thermal units. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported Thursday that domestic supplies of natural gas rose by 75 billion cubic feet for the week ended Oct. 2. On average, analysts polled by S&P Global Platts forecast an increase of 71 billion cubic feet."}]}
