NKLA, -1.36% shares dipped sharply late in Wednesday's session after a report that the electric-truck company's chief executive exaggerated capabilities of a prototype that was displayed in 2016. Bloomberg News reported that Nikola CEO Trevor Milton suggested at a 2016 event that a prototype big-rig \"fully functions and works,\" but anonymous sources said that it did not have a fuel cell nor other parts that would have allowed it to be operable. \"I never deceived anyone,\" Milton told Bloomberg. At the time of the Nikola One unveiling, MIlton said that deliveries of the truck would begin in 2020, but the company now says it expects no revenue this year. Nikola went public through a special acquisition company, or SPAC, earlier this year and shares have roared higher since, gaining 184% in the past month. Shares were up more than 9% in Wednesday's session before a sharp drop immediately after the article was published, and the stock ended the session up 1.8% at $64.06."}]}
