Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stock TSLA, +1.89% \u00c2 tumbled 8.6% in midday trading, and was on track for its lowest close in two weeks. Shares are down more than 20% in September, but have nearly quadrupled this year, compared with gains of less than 2% for the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87%. Tesla late Tuesday unveiled a road map to what it called better, 56% cheaper and more efficient batteries set to lower electric-car prices. The plans included changes in battery size, design and engineering, and are being developed at a pilot battery plant in Fremont, Calif. The company also announced a future $25,000, fully autonomous car within three years and a longer-range, souped up \u00e2\u0080\u009cPlaid\u00e2\u0080\u009d Model S sedan version.

It was \u00e2\u0080\u009cclose to working,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Chief Executive Elon Musk said at the event. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt does work but not with a high yield,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he went on to say, sending the stock plunging in the late session Tuesday. Wall Street latched onto that multiyear horizon and a perceived lack of specifics, although at least one investment bank upgraded its rating on to buy and recommended a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbuy the dip.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cOverall, Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s battery day was long on vision and boldness, but short on specifics and near term deliverables,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein said in a note Wednesday. The event \u00e2\u0080\u009cat times felt more visionary (even \u00e2\u0080\u009cvaporware-ish\u00e2\u0080\u009d) than specific, with few details\u00e2\u0080\u009d around production locations, timing, and key technical milestones achieved so far, he said. Moreover, an improved battery technology \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill only get Tesla a small part of the way towards achieving\u00e2\u0080\u009d the goal of selling a $25,000 car, Sacconaghi said. On the positive side, Musk\u00e2\u0080\u0099s statement that he expected Tesla to grow 30% to 40% this year is consistent with earlier plans and \u00e2\u0080\u009cappears to imply a strong Q4,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Emmanuel Rosner at Deutsche Bank upgraded Tesla stock to buy from hold, saying that Battery Day showcased an \u00e2\u0080\u009cimpressive trajectory for its technology, capacity and cost, which should help accelerate the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shift to electric vehicles and extend Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lead considerably.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In addition to the planned battery-technology improvements and the \u00e2\u0080\u009cModel 2\u00e2\u0080\u009d $25,000 car, Tesla also unveiled plans to build \u00e2\u0080\u009cmassive\u00e2\u0080\u009d battery-cell capacity, which would open new markets for Tesla in long-haul trucking, stationary energy storage, and supplying batteries to other manufacturers, Rosner said. He raised his price target on Tesla to $500 from $400, implying a 26% upside from Wednesday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prices. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith the stock price indicated down post market as traders \u00e2\u0080\u0098sell the news,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 we recommend longer-term investors take advantage of weakness to buy Tesla as the best way to invest in vehicle electrification,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley highlighted the costs associated with Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s battery plans. Battery Day \u00e2\u0080\u009clargely lived up to the hype, but didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t clearly exceed it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said in a note. Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s battery technology \u00e2\u0080\u009cis outpacing current growth in supply... and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to spend significantly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It is \u00e2\u0080\u009ctoo soon to tell if the increase in execution risk is commensurate with the potential increase in rewards beyond that already heavily discounted in the current share price,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jonas said. Patrick Hummel at UBS said that \u00e2\u0080\u009cpatience was required,\u00e2\u0080\u009d since most of what Tesla presented on Battery Day is at least one year from fruition and lacked detail. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNonetheless, we remain confident Tesla remains the battery tech and cost leader,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, with the caveat that leadership \u00e2\u0080\u009cseems already fully discounted.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Garrett Nelson at CFRA said he came away \u00e2\u0080\u009cimpressed\u00e2\u0080\u009d with Tesla plans, but the hype leading up to the event was such that the \u00e2\u0080\u009csell the news reaction was perhaps unavoidable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf there was any disappointment, we think it was the fact there was no mention of a million mile battery per se,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Musk\u00e2\u0080\u0099s focus on lowering vehicle prices and making electric cars more affordable also may have raised some concerns among investors hoping that the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s innovations would instead result in \u00e2\u0080\u009cmust have\u00e2\u0080\u009d features, Nelson said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNonetheless, we remain hard-pressed to find a more compelling EPS growth story and view [Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s] addition to the S&P 500 as an eventuality and positive catalyst,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said."}]}
