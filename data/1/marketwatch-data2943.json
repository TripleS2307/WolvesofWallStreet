The European regional director for the WHO said in a radio interview that increasing infections among young people could be responsible for rising case numbers. \u201cWe\u2019re receiving reports from several health authorities of a higher proportion of new infections among young people,\u201d Dr Hans Kluge told BBC radio.

Kluge said he understood that young people did not want to miss out on summer, but said: \u201cThey have a responsibility towards themselves, their parents, grandparents and their communities and we do know, how now to adopt good healthy behaviours so let\u2019s take advantage of the knowledge.\u201d \u201cAn increasing number of countries experienced localised outbreaks and a resurgence in cases. Whether this is a first wave or a second wave, what we do know is it\u2019s a consequence of a change in human behaviour,\u201d he said. He said the evidence of the surge in cases among young people was anecdotal, but that health authorities and governments should find ways to better engage with young people.
