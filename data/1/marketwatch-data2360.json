Gimenez is keeping open hotel pools, summer camps, daycare centers, retailers, and personal care services as long as people practice social distancing. \"Beaches will be open on Tuesday,\" he said in a news release. \"But if we see crowding and people not following the public health rules, I will be forced to close the beaches again.\" Florida is one of many states to face a surge in COVID-19 cases in recent weeks. In Dade County, there were 1,984 new cases of COVID-19 on Sunday, with a total of 48,243 cases and 4,146 deaths, according to the Florida Department of Health."}]}
