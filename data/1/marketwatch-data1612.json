Getty Images Donald Trump came to power promising to fix a trade system that has hurt U.S. workers and businesses for generations. He railed against trade deals, raised alarm about the trade deficit, and promised to bring back jobs. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t lose one plant, I promise you that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told Michigan voters in 2016. Four years later, Michigan has actually lost three major auto plants.\u00c2 Even before the pandemic, the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s job growth had plunged to its lowest level in a decade, my co-authors and I found in a new report, with investment from the auto industry down 29%. Next door in Ohio, annual job creation also collapsed\u00e2\u0080\u0094from 36,200 in 2016 to just 3,700 in 2019. And the U.S. trade deficit has been higher every single year of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidency than it was when he took office. \u201c American farmers have lost an important market\u00e2\u0080\u0094in some cases their most important market\u00e2\u0080\u0094and American taxpayers have borne the cost, as Trump has had to replace farm income with billions in compensation checks from the government.\u00c2 \u201d The truth is, Trump failed these workers. With Trump and Joe Biden set to face off on a debate stage in Ohio on Sept. 29, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good time to ask: What are the real problems with U.S. trade policy, and what would a better approach be?\u00c2 U.S. trade problems were a long time in the making.\u00c2 The process through which U.S. trade policy is made has long been vulnerable to special and corporate interests.\u00c2 U.S. trade policy is carried out by the U.S. Trade Representative, the negotiating arm of the executive branch, based on broad instructions from Congress and informed by a system of \u00e2\u0080\u009cadvisory committees.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In theory, these committees should bring a wide array of voices and interests to inform the executive branch negotiators.\u00c2 Instead, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve become a club for corporate interests. A 2014 Washington Post review found that all but two of the 19 sectoral advisory committees exclusively contained representatives of private firms and their business associations. In the remaining two\u00e2\u0080\u0094for agricultural trade and animal products\u00e2\u0080\u0094those interests made up 90% of the members.\u00c2 Under Trump, the corporate domination of trade policy has gotten worse.\u00c2 Opinion: A Nobel laureate makes the economic case for Joe Biden \u201c As a result of this corporate domination, trade policy over the last few decades has been tailored to help corporations maximize their profits, not to help American workers or small businesses. \u201d The overall advisory committee, the Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations (ACTPN), had 19 industry representatives and 12 public advocacy representatives (from unions, think tanks, state government, and an environmental group) under Obama. Under Trump, it still has 19 industry representatives\u00e2\u0080\u0094but the number of non-industry representatives has dwindled to just three, including a Republican governor and the president of a conservative think tank.\u00c2 As a result of this corporate domination, trade policy over the last few decades has been tailored to help corporations maximize their profits, not to help American workers or small businesses. Outsourcing has become easier, which pushes down U.S. manufacturing wages and investment.Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approach has made these problems worse. As a candidate, Trump promised to reverse these trends by canceling and renegotiating trade agreements. But his efforts have backfired. The U.S. is simply too enmeshed with the world to win back jobs by simply pulling back from trade.\u00c2 Trump based his tariffs on the assumption that the U.S. is so powerful that it could unilaterally impose tariffs on trading partners without them retaliating. Related: U.S. tariffs on China are illegal, says World Trade Organization As Peter Navarro, director of the White House National Trade Council, said in 2018: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe any country is going to retaliate for the simple reason that we are the most lucrative and biggest market in the world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2 But this prediction has not come true. In fact, the opposite has happened: Our trading partners have promised to retaliate \u00e2\u0080\u009cdollar for dollar,\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the words of Chrystia Freeland, Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deputy prime minister.\u00c2 When Trump lashed out at Chinese and Canadian suppliers of metals and metal-using goods, they predictably retaliated and the U.S. economy suffered for it. His tariffs on aluminum hurt U.S. industries that use aluminum, which are far more numerous than those that produce it. And Canada answered Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tariffs with countermeasures of its own, raising the price of U.S. aluminum and aluminum-containing goods\u00e2\u0080\u0094including washing machines made at the very Ohio plant where Trump first announced the tariffs. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trade war with China has had equally dismal results. After Trump initiated this conflict by levying tariffs on Chinese-made goods, China retaliated with tariffs on U.S. agricultural goods.\u00c2 American farmers have lost an important market\u00e2\u0080\u0094in some cases their most important market\u00e2\u0080\u0094and American taxpayers have borne the cost, as Trump has had to replace farm income with billions in compensation checks from the government.\u00c2 In 2016, China bought $13.7 billion in U.S. soybeans. By 2018, that figure had fallen by nearly half, to $7.1 billion. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009ctariff on Chinese products and the resulting retaliation by China on soybeans,\u00e2\u0080\u009d warned the Ohio Soybean Association, makes us less competitive in the global market\u00e2\u0080\u009d and virtually guarantees \u00e2\u0080\u009cnegative effects on soybean prices and farmers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 incomes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The U.S. trade deficit in goods has worsened under President Donald Trump. Through all of this, Trump has pointed to the trade balance as his main barometer for how our industries are performing. Unsurprisingly, the trade balance has only gotten worse under his tenure\u00e2\u0080\u0094even before the pandemic hit. Nor has his approach stopped offshoring by U.S. companies. In fact, investment in China by U.S. companies was higher in 2019 than in 2016, the year Trump was elected. This investment was led by manufacturing companies like General Electric GE, +2.85% and Tesla TSLA, +1.89%, who built new factories in China rather than in the U.S.\u00c2 Election coverage: Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how key swing states are leaning in the presidential race \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and how they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re weathering the recessionAmerica must do better by its workers. The last several years have shown that picking fights with trading partners around the world is not a winning strategy. To improve working people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s standard of living\u00e2\u0080\u0094at home and abroad\u00e2\u0080\u0094the U.S. needs to work with its trading partners, not against them.\u00c2 Three ideas to start moving in the right direction include: Rein in footloose capital. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tariffs haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stopped offshoring, but the problem can be addressed by eliminating treaty rules that prohibit capital controls, which limit corporations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ability to relocate operations to push down wages. The damage done by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which slashed corporate taxes on foreign profits from 28% to 10% and incentivized U.S. companies to offshore production, should also be reversed.\u00c2 Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let trading partners undercut U.S. workers on the backs of their own workers. Congressional Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 changes to the United States\u00e2\u0080\u0094Mexico\u00e2\u0080\u0094Canada Agreement (USMCA)\u00e2\u0080\u0094the new NAFTA\u00e2\u0080\u0094helped place a floor under Mexican wages. These reforms should be strengthened and incorporated into all future agreements.\u00c2 Reform trade advisory panels. The U.S. Trade Representative\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cadvisory committees\u00e2\u0080\u009d should represent workers, small-business owners, and public interest groups to ensure the committees function as intended.\u00c2 As the 2020 presidential campaign comes to a head, voters will be reckoning with Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s record. On trade, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to accept that Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approach hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worked, and Rust Belt workers are paying the price.
