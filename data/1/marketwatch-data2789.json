Investors appear to be shrugging off surging coronavirus caseloads in dozens of countries. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 NIK, -0.11% gained 1.4% while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index HSI, -0.30% advanced 0.8%. The Shanghai Composite SHCOMP, +1.67% inched up 0.1% and the smaller-cap Shenzhen Composite 399106, +3.09% retreated 0.5%. South Korea\u2019s Kospi 180721, +0.21% gained 1%, and benchmark indexes in Taiwan Y9999, +1.10% , Singapore STI, -0.39% and Indonesia JAKIDX, +0.28% edged up. Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 XJO, +0.00% rose 1.7%. The Reserve Bank of Australia was scheduled to make an announcement Tuesday on interest rates following its latest monetary policy meeting. It is widely expected to leave rates unchanged. Overnight, the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% added another 0.7% onto its four-month winning streak, closing within 3% of the record high it set in February, at 3,294.61. Big Tech led the way higher again, and Microsoft MSFT, +2.48% and Apple AAPL, +1.74% alone accounted for most of the S&P 500\u2019s gain. The rally followed reports showing that manufacturing has improved across much of the world, including in China, Europe and the United States. With the total caseload rising by less than 50,000 for two straight days, investors bet that U.S. outbreaks might be moderating, said Jeffrey Halley of Oanda. \u201cHopes rose that the U.S. might avoid a deeper recession, which was all financial markets needed to send equity markets higher, and for the U.S. dollar to continue recovering some of its recent losses,\u201d Halley said in a commentary. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% rose 0.9% to 26,664.40, while gains for tech stocks, particularly Microsoft and Apple, pushed the Nasdaq composite COMP, +1.39% 1.5% higher, to 10,902.80, another record. Microsoft jumped 5.6% Monday after it confirmed that it\u2019s in talks to buy the U.S. arm of TikTok, a Chinese-owned video app that is very popular but has also drawn the White House\u2019s scrutiny. Microsoft said its CEO, Satya Nadella, has discussed the issue with President Donald Trump, and the tech giant expects the talks with TikTok to end no later than Sept. 15, either with a deal or without. Apple added 2.5%, piling more gains onto its 10.5% rise Friday following a blowout report showing that its profits during the spring easily topped Wall Street\u2019s expectations. In Washington, slow, grinding negotiations on another huge relief effort for the U.S. economy continue, with both the Trump administration negotiating team and top Capitol Hill Democrats reporting progress over the weekend. The discussions have added urgency now that $600 in weekly benefits from the federal government for laid-off workers have expired, just as the number of layoffs ticks up amid a resurgence of coronavirus counts and business restrictions. The continued spread of the coronavirus is raising worries that the economy could backslide again and snuff out the budding improvements it\u2019s shown. Through the pandemic, though, Big Tech has remained almost immune to such concerns on expectations that it can continue to grow. Apart from the \u201cwall of money\u201d buttressing markets thanks to massive monetary stimulus and government spending, it seems that \u201cinvestors are already inoculated from the virus while camping under the tech umbrella,\u201d Stephen Innes of AxiCorp. said in a commentary. Meanwhile, across the market corporate profits have exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations. Roughly two-thirds of the way into earnings season, 84% of S&P 500 companies have reported stronger results than expected, according to FactSet.
