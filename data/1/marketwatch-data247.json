This is based on the idea of what marketing scholars call the \u00e2\u0080\u009cpain of paying.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It \u00e2\u0080\u009churts\u00e2\u0080\u009d when we give our hard-earned money to the cashier, even if doing so means receiving a product or service in kind. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pain that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s both\u00c2 emotional\u00c2 and detectable in\u00c2 neurological scans, but physical pain can mute it. In a\u00c2 series of studies, I found that being in physical anguish reduces the pain of paying, and so people end up spending more money. In one study, participants were asked to place their hands in cold water, a common technique to induce pain, and view a computer mouse for sale on a screen. I found that people experiencing mild discomfort were 67% more likely to be interested in buying the mouse than those whose hands remained dry and pain-free. In another study conducted in Melbourne, Australia, people going in and out of a dentist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office were offered a coffee mug and asked how much they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be willing to pay for it, from nothing to AU$12. People coming out of the office, who were more likely to be in pain because of their procedures, offered to pay an average of AU$4.42 for the mug, while those entering offered to pay AU$3.67. Because the same area of the human brain processes all sorts of pain, being in physical pain takes up more of the brain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resources, making it harder to process \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and feel \u00e2\u0080\u0094 other types of discomfort, such as emotional pain one might feel from\u00c2 being socially rejected by others, and the\u00c2 pain of paying for things.Why it matters Nearly 1 in 5 Americans\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 about 65 million \u00e2\u0080\u0094 experiences chronic pain, with similar shares in\u00c2 Europe,\u00c2 Australia\u00c2 and\u00c2 China. Past research has studied how pain lowers\u00c2 life satisfaction and psychological well-being. But I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find any studies that looked at how pain affects consumer behavior, which is important because, after all, people in pain still need to make decisions about what to buy every day. I believe that my findings are important for another reason. The pain of paying helps us\u00c2 avoid overspending. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRetail therapy\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2 can be common during tough times\u00c2 like the pandemic, and the plethora of discounts and instant gratification\u00c2 when shopping online\u00c2 can be tempting. My findings suggest that people in physical pain may be more susceptible to surge pricing and other marketing tricks that get people to\u00c2 spend more money. Americans are already holding\u00c2 a lot of credit card debt\u00c2 as it is.What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next My colleagues and I have also started looking at how physical pain influences what people choose to eat. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in the initial stages of the research, but we have early evidence that being in physical pain increases people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s willingness to eat more fast food. The reason seems to be the same: We experience guilt when we eat too much junk food, and experiencing physical pain seems to decrease this emotion. Eugene Y.
