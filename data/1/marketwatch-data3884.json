Gov. Kate Brown said Trump is looking for a confrontation in the hopes of winning political points elsewhere. It also serves as a distraction from the coronavirus pandemic, which is causing spiking numbers of infections in Oregon and the nation. Brown\u2019s spokesman, Charles Boyle, said Friday that arresting people without probable cause is \u201cextraordinarily concerning and a violation of their civil liberties and constitutional rights.\u201d Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum said she would file a lawsuit in federal court against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the Marshals Service, Customs and Border Protection and Federal Protection Service alleging they have violated the civil rights of Oregonians by detaining them without probable cause. She will also seek a temporary restraining order against them. The ACLU of Oregon said the federal agents appear to be violating people\u2019s rights, which \u201cshould concern everyone in the United States.\u201d \u201cUsually when we see people in unmarked cars forcibly grab someone off the street we call it kidnapping,\u201d said Jann Carson, interim executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon. \u201cThe actions of the militarized federal officers are flat-out unconstitutional and will not go unanswered.\u201d Federal officers have charged at least 13 people with crimes related to the protests so far, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported Thursday. Some have been detained by the federal courthouse, which has been the scene of protests. But others were grabbed blocks away. \u201cThis is part of the core media strategy out of Trump\u2019s White House: to use federal troops to bolster his sagging polling data,\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cAnd it is an absolute abuse of federal law-enforcement officials.\u201d One video showed two people in helmets and green camouflage with \u201cpolice\u201d patches and no further identification grabbing a person on the sidewalk, handcuffing them and taking them into an unmarked vehicle. \u201cWho are you?\u201d someone asks the pair, who do not respond. At least some of the federal officers belong to the Department of Homeland Security. Customs and Border Protection said in a statement that its agents had information indicating the person in the video was suspected of assaulting federal agents or destroying federal property. \u201cOnce CBP agents approached the suspect, a large and violent mob moved towards their location. For everyone\u2019s safety, CBP agents quickly moved the suspect to a safer location,\u201d the agency said. However, the video shows no mob. In another case, Mark Pettibone, 29, said a minivan rolled up to him around 2 a.m. Wednesday and four or five people got out \u201clooking like they were deployed to a Middle Eastern war.\u201d Pettibone told the Associated Press he got to his knees as the group approached. They dragged him into the van without identifying themselves or responding to his questions and pulled his beanie over his eyes so he couldn\u2019t see, he said. \u201cI figured I was just going to disappear for an indefinite amount of time,\u201d Pettibone said. Pettibone said he was put into a cell and officers dumped the contents of his backpack, with one remarking: \u201cOh, this is a bunch of nothing.\u201d After he asked for a lawyer, Pettibone was allowed to leave. \u201cAuthoritarian governments, not democratic republics, send unmarked authorities after protesters,\u201d Democratic U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley said in a tweet. U.S. Attorney Billy Williams in Portland said Friday he has requested the Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General to investigate the actions of DHS personnel. In a letter Friday, Oregon\u2019s two senators and two of its House members demanded that U.S. Attorney General William Barr and Homeland Security Acting Secretary Chad Wolf immediately withdraw \u201cthese federal paramilitary forces from our state.\u201d The members of Congress also said they\u2019ll be asking the DHS inspector general and the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate the presence and actions of federal forces in Portland. \u201cIt\u2019s painfully clear this administration is focused purely on escalating violence without answering my repeated requests for why this expeditionary force is in Portland and under what constitutional authority,\u201d Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden said. On Thursday night, federal officers deployed tear gas and fired non-lethal rounds into a crowd of protesters. Wolf visited Portland on Thursday and called the demonstrators, who are protesting racism and police brutality, \u201cviolent anarchists.\u201d Wolf blamed state and city authorities for not putting an end to the protests. But Portland police said Friday they wound up arresting 20 people overnight. At least two protests occurred Thursday night, one near the federal courthouse and the other by a police station in another part of the city. Police told protesters to leave that site after announcing they heard some chanting about burning down the building. Protester Paul Frazier said Friday the chant was \u201cmuch more rhetorical than an actual statement.\u201d Portland Police Chief Chuck Lovell told reporters Friday that his officers are in contact with the federal agents, but that neither controls the others\u2019 actions. \u201cWe do communicate with federal officers for the purpose of situational awareness and deconfliction,\u201d Lovell said. \u201cWe\u2019re operating in a very, very close proximity to one another.\u201d The American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Oregon on Friday added the federal government to a lawsuit it filed earlier to halt the use of crowd control measures, including tear gas and rubber bullets, against journalists and legal observers at protests in Portland. \u201cThe lawsuit is one of many the ACLU will be filing against federal authorities in Portland for their unconstitutional attacks on people protesting the police killing of George Floyd,\u201d the group said. Tensions have escalated in the past two weeks, particularly after an officer with the U.S. Marshals Service fired a less-lethal round at a protester\u2019s head on July 11, critically injuring him. The protests following the police killing of Floyd in Minneapolis have often devolved into violent clashes between smaller groups and the police."}]}
