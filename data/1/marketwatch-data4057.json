But these days, they are suddenly gaining a newfound respectability, with a host of craft-style companies entering the market. Sales are up as well: Market researcher Nielsen says spirits-based ready-to-drink products \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the industry term for such beverages \u00e2\u0080\u0094 saw a 40.7% annual sales spike in 2019. Siponey is a new brand to enter the market, offering a sweet twist on the canned cocktail \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all about honey (as in sip honey, or Siponey for short). The company plans to make all its products with honey as a key ingredient, in part to draw attention to efforts to keep the honeybee population strong at a time when concerns are growing about its future stability. But Amanda Victoria, a veteran New York City spirits professional and former bartender who founded the brand with her husband, horticultaralist Joseph Mintz, also asserts that honey is a more natural and healthier sweetener than white sugar.

Victoria says she was just as fussy about the rye that goes into the drink as the honey, noting she searched across the U.S. for a whiskey that \u00e2\u0080\u009cwould exhibit a complexity that was spicy and a little minty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d What we think about it: We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re big fans of the new wave of canned cocktails hitting the market. (We told you a few months ago about Cutwater Spirits, another emerging brand.) Siponey fits in nicely with the trend \u00e2\u0080\u0094 its Siponey Royale is a fine example of a beverage that balances sweetness and refreshment and delivers a somewhat boozy punch at the same time (you definitely taste the rye and its hints of mint). It seems tailor-made for a summer day. How to enjoy it: Obviously, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to do anything more than pop open a chilled can and sip away. By virtue of its bubbly nature, the drink also goes well with lots of food \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Victoria suggests everything from cheese plates to potato chips."}]}
