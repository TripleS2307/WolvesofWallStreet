Personal spending jumped 5.6% in June, the government said Friday, after a revised 8.5% advance in May. Incomes fell 1.1% \u2014 somewhat more than expected \u2014 owing to reduced federal aid for families. The government sent onetime stimulus checks to most families in May as part of an unprecedented effort by Washington to keep people working or provide them with more generous unemployment benefits during the worst health crisis in a century. More aid was distributed in June, just not as much.

The PCE index, the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation barometer, rose by 0.4%. The yearly rate of inflation was quite low, however, at less than 1%. What happened: Consumers spent more on new cars and trucks, clothing, gasoline and recreation as the economy largely reopened in June. Americans also spent more on medical care as they returned to hospitals for treatments unrelated to the coronavirus. Still, spending is running well below pre-crisis levels with so many Americans out of work and others worried about their financial security.

Households have been saving a record levels just in case the economy or their own situations take a turn for the worse. Inflation, for its part, poses little threat to the economy right now. Although the cost of some staples such as gas and food have risen, most companies have had to cut prices of goods and services to generate sales after a collapse in demand early in the pandemic. Read:Consumer confidence wanes in July and points to rockier economic recovery The rate of inflation in the past 12 months rose to 0.8% from 0.5%, according to the PCE index. Yet it\u2019s well below January\u2019s 1.9% pace. A separate measure of inflation that strips out food and energy, known as the core rate, edged up 0.2% in June. It\u2019s risen just 0.9% in the past year, however, and is sitting nearly the lowest level since the Great Recession a decade earlier. See: MarketWatch Economic Calendar Big picture: The reopening of the economy fueled a rebound in May and early June as millions of Americans returned to work. Yet another large outbreak of coronavirus cases sapped the recovery of momentum and a variety of measures show economic growth has waned in July. What\u2019s likely to determine if growth picks up again is whether Washington extends emergency unemployment benefits and other measures. They expire this week. Without more aid, economists say, the recovery is likely to lose more steam.

Yet \u201chigh-frequency indicators suggest consumption slowed in July due to the partial rollback of reopenings in several states.\u201d \u201cWith numerous assistance programs expiring, and a mismanaged health crisis constraining spending on services, the second phase of the recovery will likely be much slower,\u201d said chief U.S. economist Gregory Daco of Oxford Economics.
