Asana is expected to list with a market value of more than $5 billion, according to Renaissance Capital, an operator of IPO exchange-traded funds and provider of institutional research. \u201cRecent software IPOs have outperformed, although direct listings historically haven\u2019t seen the same enthusiasm: last year\u2019s sole direct listing, Slack Technologies WORK, +3.36%, last closed up 5% from its reference price, while 2018 direct listing Spotify SPOT, +0.08% saw little action until soaring more than 100% in the 2Q as usage spiked during the pandemic,\u201d Renaissance Capital co-Founder and Chief Executive Bill Smith said in commentary.

BABA, -0.26% went public, raising $25 billion in what was the biggest deal ever. That deal is expected to be eclipsed by the flotation of Ant Group, the payments company that was set up to serve Alibaba in 2004 and was spun off in 2011.
