Venkat India's central bank kept its lending rate unchanged and said that the country's economy could break out of contraction and turn positive in the fourth quarter. However, for the whole year, the country, which has been one of the worst hit by Covid-19, could see its gross domestic product contract 9.5%, Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das said Friday. India's fiscal year runs April to March. \"Faster, strong rebound is feasible,\" Mr. Das said, citing revival of economic activity in construction, agriculture and some manufacturing sectors in the July-September quarter. India's economy has been the worst-hit of the world's major economies, as business and consumer activities stalled due to the restrictions government imposed to contain the spread of the pandemic. The country's economy shrank 23.9% during the April-June quarter, which is the worst such decline since 1996, when the government started reporting quarterly numbers. The lockdown that began late March was among the strictest in the world, shutting down virtually every nonessential part of the economy. The government had started to ease some of the restrictions from May and economic activity has since picked up momentum, but many economists predict that the economy is likely to shrink for the whole of the current fiscal year. India has more than 6.91 million confirmed infections and over 106,490 deaths from the coronavirus. With the policy rates being unchanged, the key repo rate stands as 4.00% and reverse repo at 3.35%.
