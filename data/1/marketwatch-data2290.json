XOM, -1.47% is mulling over deeper spending and job cuts as it seeks to preserve its dividend, Reuters reported Thursday citing people familiar with the plans. Exxon and Chevron Corp. CVX, -1.62% are the only energy companies on a list of \"dividend aristocrats,\" or S&P companies that have increased their dividend every year for at least 25 consecutive years. Exxon is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings on Friday before the bell. Analysts polled by FactSet expect Exxon to swing to a GAAP loss of 47 cents a share on sales of $38.2 billion, which would be around 45% lower than second-quarter 2019 sales. Exxon has increased its dividend each year for the last 37 years."}]}
