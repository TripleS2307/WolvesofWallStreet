The gym chain said it expects to secure about $250 million in debtor-in-possession financing, which should provide the company with enough liquidity to continue operations, including phased reopenings of its fitness clubs. The company expects to to reopen most of its clubs by the end of June. \"We expect to have substantial financing with a path to restructuring our balance sheet and operations to ensure a resilient future,\" said Chief Executive Tony Ueber. Late Sunday, the company said that will permanently close 100 locations, and The Wall Street Journal had reported in May that the company was looking to stay afloat during a possible Chapter 11 filing."}]}
