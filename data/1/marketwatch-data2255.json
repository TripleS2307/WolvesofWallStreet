Wall Street economists had forecast an increase of 1 million private-sector jobs, according to Econoday. See ADP report The increase in hiring last month topped a revised 212,000 increase in July, the giant payroll processor said. Initially ADP had reported that just 167,000 new jobs were created in that month. The economy has recouped fewer than half of the 20 million-plus jobs lost in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. What\u2019s worse, a number of companies such as American Airlines AAL, +0.34% and MGM MGM, -2.59% have recently announced new layoffs with their businesses still struggling months after the pandemic began.

Hiring rose the fastest in hotels, restaurants, retail, education, health care and professional businesses. The only segment of the economy to lose jobs again was information \u2014 media, public relations and the like. See: MarketWatch Economic Calendar Big picture: The ADP report suggests the economic recovery ran into stiffer resistance for the second month in a row, but it\u2019s not always a reliable bellwether. The report, for instance, has shown fewer new jobs created in each of the past four months than the government\u2019s initial estimate. The Labor Department on Friday is likely to report the U.S. created 1.2 million new jobs in August, according to economists polled by MarketWatch. Yet what does seem clear from ADP and other employment barometers is that companies are bringing workers back more slowly compared to earlier in the summer. Or not at all.

That will make it even harder for the economy to return to normal.

Market reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% and S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% were set to open higher in Wednesday trades."}]}
