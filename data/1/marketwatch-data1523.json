Both gold and silver traded up for the sixth straight week, trying to \u201cestablish a base\u201d around $1,800 for gold and around $19 for silver, said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at ThinkMarkets. Investment demand for the metals \u201cshould offset any weakness for jewelry purchases, due to ongoing economic uncertainty and, more to the point, a prolonged period of zero or sub-zero interest rates,\u201d he said in a market update. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, the U.S. dollar remains out of favour despite bouncing here and there.\u201d Given that, \u201cnoninterest-bearing and buck-denominated gold and silver stand ready to benefit further,\u201d said Razaqzada. Meanwhile, \u201csilver, which is also and industrial material, could experience relatively higher demand compared with gold as the world economy recovers from the pandemic.\u201d Gold for August delivery GC00, +2.17% on Comex rose $9.70, or 0.5%, to settle at $1,810 an ounce, while September silver US:SIU20 added 19 cents, or 1%, at $19.764 an ounce. Gold logged a nearly 0.5% weekly rise and was up 18.8% for the year to date after hitting its highest level since 2011 earlier this month and moving within striking distance of its all-time high. Silver ended more than 3.7% higher for the week. Most-active gold and silver contracts logged a sixth straight weekly rise, according to FactSet data. \u201cGold prices are steadily rising as investors start to raise their stimulus expectations on coronavirus second wave fears,\u201d said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, in a note. \u201cGold is also starting to benefit from election risk, as Wall Street can\u2019t ignore the polls anymore and is starting to price in the risk of a Biden presidency,\u201d given presumptive Democratic nominee Joseph Biden\u2019s lead over President Donald Trump in the polls. The White House and lawmakers face increasing pressure to come up with an additional fiscal stimulus plan ahead of the expiration of supplemental unemployment benefits at the end of the month.

Among other Comex metals, September copper US:HGU20 rose 0.1% to $2.9045 a pound and ended the week about 0.2% higher.
