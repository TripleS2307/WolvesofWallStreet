The big challenges remain. AFP via Getty Images The U.S. economy is doing \u201cas good or better than expected\u201d in the third quarter, but risks are building for a setback in the fourth quarter if the government doesn\u2019t provide more stimulus and certainty, says Spencer Staples, chief economist for EconAlpha and the winner of the Forecaster of the Month contest for August. \u201cThe pandemic, as tragic as it is, has been an eye-opener,\u201d he says. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a structural problem; it is a health issue.\u201d If the Congress and the White House can\u2019t provide more certainty about the pandemic and the economy, he could see economic growth struggling again by the end of the year and beyond. The recovery so far has mostly been a matter of picking the \u201clow-hanging fruit,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is still a lot of dislocation here.\u201d The economy faces a massive output gap that will take years to close, he says. Meanwhile, society confronts what he calls \u201cnational imperatives\u201d to address simultaneous challenges of the demographic time bomb, urgent environmental problems, and a widening gap between the haves and the have-nots. More on the winner: If you trade on economic data, listen to Spencer Staples Staples says his small independent research firm generally avoids politics, but he believes this is one of those times when the free market can\u2019t create the self-sustaining economy we need. \u201cThere are times we need targeted government programs,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve come to that point.\u201d He thinks a \u201ccentrist administration\u201d could restore bipartisan confidence for businesses and households. Staples has won our monthly contest seven times, and was the winner of the Forecaster of the Year contest in 2010, the last person not named Jim O\u2019Sullivan to win that honor. In this year\u2019s standings, Staples is in fourth place. Staples judges his forecasts on whether he\u2019s closer than the consensus of his peers. In August, he was closer to the Bloomberg consensus on seven of the 10 indicators we track. Two of his forecasts\u2014housing starts and durable goods orders\u2014were the most accurate in our contest. The runners up in the August contest were Jim O\u2019Sullivan of TD Securities, Christophe Barraud of Market Securities, Daniel Ahn\u2019s team at BNP Paribas, and Michael Feroli of JP Morgan.
