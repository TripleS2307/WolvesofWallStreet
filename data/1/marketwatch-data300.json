{"article": [{"url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/unite-group-sees-rental-income-falling-2020-10-08", "published": 1602126140.0, "headline": "Unite Group sees rental income falling", "body": "Unite Group PLC Thursday said that the valuation of its property portfolio rose 0.7% during the third quarter due to the U.K. government's coronavirus stimulus measures, and that its rental income is set to fall. The FTSE 250 student-accommodation developer said its Unite U.K. Student Accommodation Fund property portfolio was independently valued at 2.80 billion pounds ($3.62 billion). The company said the London Student Accommodation Joint Venture investment portfolio was also independently valued at GBP1.32 billion. The company said the valuation increase was mostly driven by the temporary raising of the stamp duty threshold for residential properties, and that, factoring this out, its portfolios' valuations were flat. For the 2020-2021 academic year, rental income is expected to fall in the range of 10%-20%, in line with expectations set in July. However, the company said it has achieved GBP12 million to GBP15 million of cost savings in 2020. The company said that for the 2020-2021 academic year, it has achieved a rate of 88% of bed spaces let, down from 98% the previous academic year and marginally short of its 90% target. The company said it is still too early to reinstate dividends given coronavirus-driven instability, but added it has a positive outlook for student demand in the 2021-2022 academic year and beyond.
