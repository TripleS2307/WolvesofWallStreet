We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve proven that it works in the state of New York,\u00e2\u0080\u009d He also called for Trump to issue an executive order that would require people to wear face coverings in public.

You can see the crowds on street corners. It is undeniable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Cuomo. Indoor dining was expected to begin as part of Phase 3 of reopening next Monday, but both Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio, speaking at his own briefing on Monday, said the dining component might be postponed.\u00c2 Also see: Is it safe to go back to the gym if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re over 50?
