Politico, which first reported the news, as well as Bloomberg News and Reuters, said a memo from a Republican on the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust subcommittee. According to the reports, GOP Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado said the Democrats are drafting ideas that would limit future acquisitions of giants such as Amazon AMZN, +3.01%, Google owner Alphabet GOOG, +1.97%, Apple AAPL, +1.74%, and Facebook FB, +0.26%. Buck said he agreed with some of the measures, while disagreeing with more far-reaching breakup proposals. The Bloomberg report said one measure would block the giants from both owning marketplaces and selling their own products on them. The report from the Democrats, who are the majority on the committee, had been slated for release as early as Tuesday, but it\u2019s now delayed, according to Politico. Their ideas could turn into laws if, as polling suggests, Democrats also capture the U.S. Senate and the presidency in the coming election. Nasdaq-100 futures NQ00, +1.63% were lower on Tuesday.
