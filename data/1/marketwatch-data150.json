The real-estate company said that it will resume payment of dividends--suspended to conserve cash following the start of the coronavirus pandemic--and it will declare an interim dividend in its half-year results in November. Future dividends will be paid semiannually instead of quarterly, and will be set at 80% of underlying earnings per share. The company said all of its retail assets and 86% of its tenanted stores have reopened over the quarter ended Sept. 29 following the easing of lockdown restrictions. Footfall rose to 84% of the levels experienced a year prior, and retailer sales returned to 90% of year-earlier levels, it said. Collection rates for the June quarter have improved to 74%, including 98% of rent collected for office and 57% of retail assets as of Oct. 1, and September collection rates are at 69%, including 91% of offices and 50% of retail. The company said its balance sheet remained strong with one billion pounds ($1.29 billion) of undrawn facilities and cash, and no requirement to refinance until 2024.
