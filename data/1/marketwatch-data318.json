A Trump version of the classic Southern California symbol didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even last a day. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Here are some other angles: iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } The president seemed to appreciate the effort: iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Those five letters, prominently displayed Tuesday morning on the hills above the 405 Freeway in Los Angeles in what appeared to be the same font as the globally recognized Hollywood sign, were soon knocked down. The City of Angels, and the Golden State, are certainly isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Trump country, of course, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not why the sign was removed, apparently.

The sign was on private property, but the party that called it in initially voiced concerns over a potential fire. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the story, anyway.

This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the first time a Trump symbol has run into problems in this bastion of the coastal liberal elite. Trump has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame that has been targeted several times. Years back, a suspect used a pickax and sledgehammer to carve the \u00e2\u0080\u009cTrump\u00e2\u0080\u009d name from the sidewalk. Then there was this artistic rendering of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long-advocated wall. The star was again vandalized just last week \u00e2\u0080\u0094 this time by the Incredible Hulk. The perp was eventually arrested.
