The report showed the U.S. economy regained 1.8 million jobs in July as unemployment fell 10.2%. Economists polled by MarketWatch had expected a gain of 1.7 million jobs and an unemployment rate of 10.6%.

UI refers to unemployment insurance, which had been enhanced by $600 by March\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CARES Act but the extra benefit has now expired. Republican lawmakers are \u00e2\u0080\u009clikely to perceive that the jobs report gives them some more leverage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Evercore analysts added. Henrietta Treyz, director of economic policy research at Veda Partners, said she now views an agreement in August as unlikely, after earlier this week saying there was a 65% to 75% chance for that deal this month. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the wake of today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s jobs numbers and extensive conversations with staff on Capitol Hill and other advisors that make it clear there is almost no urgency at this point from either Democrats or Republicans to meet in the middle, we are revising our odds downward from 65%-75% that a deal will be reached in August, to now 65-75% this deal will be reached in September,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she wrote in a note. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a very slim chance that a deal could still be resuscitated from here and pass next week (25-35%), but that is no longer our base case.\u00e2\u0080\u009d James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, also was sounding more downbeat on a deal being reached. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s report is certainly better than expected, from a medium-term perspective it is possibly the worst outcome,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t intensify the pressure on politicians in Washington to compromise on a new fiscal deal, which means that the US$600/week unemployment benefit that ended last weekend will not be replaced with anything for at least another week, so 31 million people will continue to experience a considerable drop in their incomes at a time when job availability is becoming more scarce.\u00e2\u0080\u009d U.S. stock indexes SPX, +0.87% \u00c2 DJIA, +0.56% \u00c2 recently were trading slightly lower in the wake of the jobs report.
