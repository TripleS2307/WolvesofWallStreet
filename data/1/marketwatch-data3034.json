Writing on Twitter, Trump said the announcement on who he'll nominate to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg will take place at the White House. The president has previously said he'll name a woman, and speculation has swirled around Amy Coney Barrett and Barbara Lagoa, two U.S. Court of Appeals judges.
