Speaking at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library in Yorba Linda, Calif., Pompeo said the bond with China that the 37th president famously sought had failed to materialize. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe kind of engagement we have been pursuing has not brought the kind of change inside of China that President Nixon had hoped to induce,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pompeo said. The secretary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s speech came as tensions are flaring between Beijing and Washington in the wake of the U.S. ordering the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston. The State Department said the move was made to protect U.S. intellectual property and private information. Read:China says its consulate in Houston has been ordered shut. China has vowed retaliation if the order isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t reversed, and the U.S. is reportedly preparing for Beijing to close one or more American consulates in China. Invoking President Ronald Reagan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrust but verify\u00e2\u0080\u009d approach to the Soviet Union, Pompeo said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen it comes to the [Chinese Communist Party], I say, we must \u00e2\u0080\u0098distrust and verify.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pompeo stressed that the U.S. would keep talking with China. But he called on \u00e2\u0080\u009cevery leader of every nation\u00e2\u0080\u009d to \u00e2\u0080\u009cinsist on reciprocity, to insist on transparency and accountability from the Chinese Communist Party.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He also said the U.S. should \u00e2\u0080\u009cempower\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Chinese people, who he sought to differentiate from the party. Pompeo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s speech was the fourth in a series of addresses on China by top Trump administration officials. It comes in the thick of the U.S. presidential election campaign, in which President Donald Trump is lagging behind presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden in polls of key battleground states.

Trump has ramped up criticism of China over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak, a criticism Pompeo repeated Thursday. The initial cases of the virus occurred in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and Trump as recently as Tuesday has called it the \u00e2\u0080\u009cChina virus.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Houston-consulate order came after two Chinese hackers were accused on Tuesday by the Justice Department of stealing trade secrets and trying to pilfer research on coronavirus vaccine candidates. Trump has accused Biden of being soft on China. Meanwhile, a draft of the Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 2020 party platform calls China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trade practices unfair and says Democrats will work closely with European allies to push back on the Chinese government, the Wall Street Journal reported.
