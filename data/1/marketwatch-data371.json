Trump on Tuesday night said he supported additional targeted aid for airlines JETS, +0.16% \u00c2 and small businesses, as well as another round of stimulus checks for \u00e2\u0080\u009cour great people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d with that move coming after he had tweeted on Tuesday afternoon that he was ending negotiations on a broad relief package. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat happened yesterday afternoon would be more accurately be described as President Trump learning or acknowledging that the majority of the Senate Republican conference preferred to go into the election focused on the Supreme Court and do not have the votes for deficit-increasing legislation above the $300B level they agreed to last month,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Henrietta Treyz, director of economic policy at Veda Partners, in a note to clients. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe votes don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exist in the Senate for a deal and rather than force that reality into daylight, which would be an indicator not only of Republican resolve but President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own inability to lead the conference when it comes to legislating, he decided to cast the decision as his alone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added. Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who is lagging her Democratic challenger in polls ahead of the Nov. 3 vote, said delaying negotiations on another aid package is a \u00e2\u0080\u009chuge mistake,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said talks \u00e2\u0080\u009cshould continue.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But most Republican senators, who have a 53-seat majority in their chamber, have a different view. Last week, GOP Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, expressed skepticism about the Senate passing a bigger package. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCould you pass it? Maybe. But you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to pass it with 47 Democrats and 13 Republicans and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0094 depending on what that number is, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know where the 13 Republicans would come from,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Thune, the No. 2 Senate Republican, a week ago. To overcome a filibuster threat, a package would need 60 votes in the Senate, and Democrats control only 47. Treyz said her shop is downbeat on the chances for both targeted aid and a major package. \u00e2\u0080\u009cInvestors should anticipate a lot of spaghetti being thrown at the wall for the next few weeks, but we do not see a path for a bipartisan stimulus bill or stand-alone bailout for airlines\u00c2 becoming law,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. Analysts at Height Capital Markets also sounded pessimistic on the prospects of smaller relief measures. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe view Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s push for various stand-alone measures \u00e2\u0080\u0094 some, like airline aid, which have Democratic support \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as unlikely to proceed in an environment where Trump has cleanly absolved Democrats of all blame for the breakdown in talks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Height\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team said in a note. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat, has \u00e2\u0080\u009clittle motivation to give Trump wins on the type of stand-alone aid he is asking for.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s initial decision to end talks was \u00e2\u0080\u009cill-advised\u00e2\u0080\u009d as he aims for re-election in less than a month, the Height analysts also said, noting that one unnamed Trump campaign adviser reportedly described it as \u00e2\u0080\u009cpolitically inept.\u00e2\u0080\u009d U.S. stocks SPX, +0.87% \u00c2 were trading higher Wednesday, after closing with losses on Tuesday.
