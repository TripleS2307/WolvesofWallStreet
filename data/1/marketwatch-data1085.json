One, either through gross incompetence you have ended the 240-year history of delivering the mail reliably on time, or the second conclusion that we could gather is that you\u2019re doing this on purpose,\u201d said Rep. Stephen Lynch, a Democrat from Massachusetts. \u201cWhat the heck are you doing?\u201d DeJoy shot back that Lynch\u2019s accusations were outrageous. The two then exchanged angry words before Rep. Carolyn Maloney, who chairs the House Oversight Committee, banged her gavel. DeJoy has said he was confident the Postal Service could handle November\u2019s mail-in ballots. Things did not get any easier for DeJoy after his clash with Lynch. The Democrats\u2019 ire has been fueled in part by President Donald Trump\u2019s attack on plans for widespread mail-in voting this November. Rep. Jim Cooper, a Democrat from Tennessee, cited reports that, under DeJoy\u2019s operational changes, 53-foot mail trucks in Nashville were forced to leave on schedule even when completely empty. \u201cYour so-called reforms ... are not efficiency \u2014 that\u2019s insanity,\u201d Cooper said. Cooper said DeJoy\u2019s reforms unilaterally moved up Election Day from Nov. 3 to something like Oct. 27. Cooper asked DeJoy, who worked with Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, if he had illegally reimbursed contributions to the Trump campaign from his subordinates. \u201cThat\u2019s a outrageous claim, sir, and I resent it. What are you accusing me of?\u201d DeJoy said. \u201cAm I the only one in this room that understands that we have a $10 billion-a-year loss?\u201d DeJoy asked rhetorically. \u201cIs your backup plan to be pardoned, like Roger Stone?\u201d Cooper asked. \u201cI have no comment on that. It\u2019s not worth a comment,\u201d DeJoy replied Republicans on the House panel at first struck a bemused tone toward the hearing and the attacks on DeJoy, but their anger rose as the hearing went on. \u201cThey\u2019re out to get you,\u201d said Rep. Jim Jordan, a Republican from Ohio. \u201cThey know President Trump is going to win, and they want to keep counting.\u201d The House on Saturday passed legislation to grant the Postal Service $25 billion in funds and to prioritize election-related mail. Democrats were joined by 26 Republicans in supporting the measure. White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said the House\u2019s Postal Service legislation \u201cis going nowhere.\u201d He suggested that Senate Republicans pass their own post-office reform measure. Some of the more progressive Democrats urged DeJoy to resign, but he rejected these calls. \u201cI don\u2019t see why I would commit here right now to resigning for any reason,\u201d DeJoy said, in response to a suggestion by Rep. Katie Porter, Democrat of California, that he step down."}]}
