Harker is a voting member of the Fed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interest rate committee this year. On Tuesday, Fed Governor Lael Brainard also backed the idea of letting inflation get over 2% before the Fed takes any action to raise interest rates. This promise is called \u00e2\u0080\u009cfoward guidance\u00e2\u0080\u009d at the central bank. Typically, the Fed would hike rates preemptively if it saw inflation surging. Former Fed staffer, and now Fed watcher, Krishna Guha said he saw support rising for this new policy and strengthened forward guidance and said it was good for investors who want to take risks. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHarker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments suggest growing momentum behind this view at the U.S. central bank and should continue to support risk-appetite as investors look ahead to the coming Fed pivot to a new phase of monetary policy in which the FOMC will make longer range commitments on both rates and quantitative easing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Guha, now the vice chairman of Evercore ISI, said in a note to his clients. Harker said that controlling COVID-19 was critical to restoring the health of the economy. He said he was \u00e2\u0080\u009ca little skeptical\u00e2\u0080\u009d that the July employment report would be as strong as the prior two month\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reports given the resurgence of the virus in the South and West. Harker said he was revising down his forecast for economic growth as a result of the spread of the coronavirus. In a webcast speech later Wednesday to the Center City Proprietors Association, Harker said he expected a negative 20% growth rate in the first half of the year, followed by a 13% gain in the second half. The result would be minus 6% for the entire year. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a much sharper recession than we experienced during the financial crisis,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is going to be a slow recovery. Until we get the virus under control, we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get the economy back to full throttle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said."}]}
