Seoul\u2019s Unification Ministry said the building in the North Korean border town of Kaesong was destroyed at 2:49 p.m. It gave no further details.

The agency said the area was part of a now-shuttered industrial park where the liaison office was located. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } North Korea had earlier threatened to demolish the office as it stepped up its fiery rhetoric over Seoul\u2019s failure to stop activists from flying propaganda leaflets across the border. Some experts say North Korea is expressing its frustration because Seoul is unable to resume joint economic projects due to U.S.-led sanctions. On Saturday night, Kim Yo Jong, the influential sister of North Korea\u2019s leader, warned that Seoul will soon witness \u201ca tragic scene of the useless North-South liaison office (in North Korea) being completely collapsed.\u201d She also said she would leave to North Korea\u2019s military the right to take the next step of retaliation against South Korea. In 2018 the Korean peninsular rivals opened their first liaison office at Kaesong to facilitate better communication and exchanges since their division at the end of the World War II in 1945. When the office opened, relations between the Koreas flourished after North Korea entered talks on its nuclear weapons program. Earlier Tuesday, North Korea\u2019s military threatened to move back into zones that were demilitarized under inter-Korean peace agreements. The General Staff of the Korean People\u2019s Army said it\u2019s reviewing a ruling party recommendation to advance into unspecified border areas that had been demilitarized under agreements with the South, which would \u201cturn the front line into a fortress.\u201d While it wasn\u2019t immediately clear what actions North Korea\u2019s military might take against the South, the North has threatened to abandon a bilateral military agreement reached in 2018 to reduce tensions across the border. Inter-Korean relations began strained since the breakdown of a second summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump in Vietnam in early 2019. That summit fell apart because of disputes over how much sanctions should be lifted in return for Kim\u2019s dismantling his main nuclear complex. Kim later vowed to expand his nuclear arsenal, introduce a new strategic weapon and overcome the U.S.-led sanctions that he said \u201cstifles\u201d his country\u2019s economy."}]}
