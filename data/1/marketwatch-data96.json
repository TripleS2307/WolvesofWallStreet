Kamala Harris engaged in a more civil, substantive debate than President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden did one week earlier. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say the pair answered all the questions posed to them. One reply from Pence in particular could leave millions of Americans with pre-existing health conditions wishing for more. Moderator Susan Page asked Pence to \u00e2\u0080\u009ctell us specifically, how would your administration protect Americans with pre-existing conditions to have access to affordable insurance if the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is struck down?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pence didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t answer the question, though, at another point in the evening, he said the Trump administration has plans \u00e2\u0080\u009cto improve health care and protect pre-existing conditions for every American.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That comes weeks after the president signed an executive order pledging protections so \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmericans with pre-existing conditions can obtain the insurance of their choice at affordable rates.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But Harris didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t buy it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you have a pre-existing condition, heart disease, diabetes, breast cancer, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re coming for you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said during the debate. Between a coronavirus pandemic that had infected 7.6 million Americans as of Friday and a high-stakes Supreme Court case just weeks away, health insurance for people with pre-existing health conditions is on the minds of many. The ACA, also known as Obamacare, outlawed health insurance carriers from increasing prices or denying coverage for people due to their pre-existing conditions. There are 54 million non-elderly adults with a pre-existing condition that would have resulted in coverage denial without the ACA, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. More than 100 million people also had health conditions that, without the law, would possibly result in higher premiums and coverage limits, wrote Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the foundation, which focuses public health matters. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible a coronavirus infection would become a pre-existing condition without the ACA, according to Levitt. He also noted that Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s executive order on pre-existing conditions \u00e2\u0080\u009ccarries no force of law, and he has never released a plan to replace the ACA or protect people with pre-existing conditions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d By October, the pandemic may have already added roughly 3.4 million adults under age 65 who contracted COVID-19 to the rolls of Americans with pre-existing conditions, according to The Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation offering grants and analysis on health care matters. If the current infection rate holds, the pandemic could add over 20,000 non-elderly adults daily to the number of Americans with pre-existing conditions, researchers at the foundation estimated.

With the individual mandate penalty now at $0, the entire law falls apart, they argue. Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home state of California is leading the charge to defend the law and they say 20 million people could lose health coverage if the ACA falls. It remains to be seen whether eight justices will hear the case or nine justices will decide the matter. The confirmation hearing for Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, is scheduled to start Oct. 12. Barrett would replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a member of the court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s liberal wing, who died at age 87 last month. The confirmation hearing is scheduled to roll on over the objections of Democrats like Harris. She reiterated those concerns at the debate, saying lawmakers should let the next president pick the next judge after the election. When Page asked Pence about specific protections for people with pre-existing conditions, he pivoted to whether Harris and Biden would work to \u00e2\u0080\u009cpack the court\u00e2\u0080\u009d if they won. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a tactic where the party in power would add extra seats to the nine-person Supreme Court and fill those new seats with their own appointees. Harris didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t answer Pence\u00e2\u0080\u0099s question. Harris and Biden say they want to build on Obamacare by adding a public health insurance option and lowering the Medicaid eligibility age to 60 from 65. On Thursday, a Trump campaign spokesman criticized the Biden-Harris plan and defended the current administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work on health care matters. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Biden-Harris Bernie Sanders-inspired, socialist health care agenda would bankrupt U.S. taxpayers and eliminate quality access to health care for millions of Americans,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ken Farnaso, deputy national press secretary. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPresident Trump has fought to safeguard patients with pre-existing conditions, lower prescription drug prices, lower premiums, and will always put the health of patients first. The choice couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be more clear in November.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}]}
