An indictment made public Thursday said Maxwell, who lived for years with Epstein and was his frequent travel companion on trips around the world, facilitated Epstein\u2019s crimes by \u201chelping Epstein to recruit, groom, and ultimately abuse \u201c girls as young as 14. It also said she participated in the sexual abuse. Epstein, 66, authorities determined, killed himself in a federal detention center in New York last summer while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. See:Attorney General Barr says Epstein\u2019s death was a \u2018perfect storm of screw-ups\u2019 Maxwell has, for years, been accused by many women of recruiting them to give Epstein massages, during which they were pressured into sex. Those accusations, until now, never resulted in criminal charges. The indictment included counts of conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, enticement of a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, transportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity and two counts of perjury. \u201cMaxwell lied because the truth, as alleged, was almost unspeakable,\u201d Audrey Strauss, the acting U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said at a news conference Thursday afternoon. She called the charges against Maxwell a \u201cprequel\u201d to the charges prosecutors brought last summer against Epstein. Messages were sent Thursday to several of Maxwell\u2019s attorneys seeking comment. She has previously repeatedly denied wrongdoing and called some of the claims against her \u201cabsolute rubbish.\u201d Among the most sensational accusations was a claim by one Epstein victim, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, that Maxwell arranged for her to have sex with Britain\u2019s Prince Andrew at her London townhouse. Giuffre bolstered her allegations with a picture of her, Andrew and Giuffre that she said was taken at the time. Andrew denied her story and Maxwell, 58, said in one deposition that Giuffre was \u201ctotally lying.\u201d Andrew was not mentioned by name in the indictment, and the charges covered Maxwell\u2019s dealings with Epstein only in the period from 1994 through 1997, a period well before his alleged encounters with Giuffre in 2001. Brad Edwards, an attorney who represents Giuffre and several other Epstein victims, said his clients were relieved by the charges. \u201cToday is a very good day,\u201d he said. The indictment focused on Epstein\u2019s alleged abuse of three specific girls at his Manhattan mansion and other residences in Palm Beach, Fla.; Sante Fe, N.M.; and London. Their names were not revealed in court filings. The indictment mirrored many of the claims previously made in civil lawsuits against Maxwell, saying she would \u201centice and groom\u201d minor girls by asking them about their lives, their schools and their families. \u201cThrough this process, Maxwell and Epstein enticed victims to engage in sexual activity with Epstein. In some instances, Maxwell was present for and participated in the sexual abuse of minor victims,\u201d the indictment said. The indictment said Maxwell repeatedly lied when questioned about her conduct. It says she committed perjury in 2016 in a deposition in a civil lawsuit, in part by denying knowledge of Epstein\u2019s scheme to recruit underage girls. At the time the crimes occurred, Maxwell was in an intimate relationship with Epstein and also was paid by him to manage his various properties, according to the indictment, which included a photograph of Epstein with his arm around Maxwell and his head nuzzling hers. Epstein was initially investigated in Florida and pleaded guilty to state charges in 2008 that allowed him to avoid a lengthy prison sentence. He was free a little after a year in prison. At the time, a federal prosecutor in Florida signed off on an agreement, initially filed in secret, that barred the federal government from charging \u201cany potential co-conspirators of Epstein.\u201d Alexander Acosta, President Donald Trump\u2019s former labor secretary, resigned last year after coming under fire for overseeing that deal when he was U.S. attorney in Miami. Geoffrey Berman, the former U.S. attorney in Manhattan, argued that federal prosecutors in New York were not bound by that agreement and brought a sweeping indictment against Epstein. Berman vowed to continue seeking justice for Epstein\u2019s victims even after the financier\u2019s death but was abruptly fired last month by President Donald Trump after a standoff with Attorney General William Barr. Maxwell\u2019s indictment was celebrated by lawyers for some of Epstein\u2019s accusers. Jennifer Araoz, a woman who says Epstein raped her in his New York mansion in 2002 when she was 15, said she feared the financier\u2019s ring of conspirators for years. \u201cNow that the ring has been taken down, I know that I can\u2019t be hurt anymore,\u201d Araoz, now 33, said in a statement. \u201cDay after day, I have waited for the news that Maxwell would be arrested and held accountable for her actions. Her arrest is a step in that direction, and it truly means that the justice system didn\u2019t forget about us.\u201d Spencer T. Kuvin, who represents some of the women, said Maxwell was \u201chopefully be the first of many co-conspirators to face the consequences of this horrific crimes.\u201d Maxwell was described in a lawsuit by another Epstein victim, Sarah Ransome, as the \u201chighest-ranking employee\u201d of Epstein\u2019s alleged sex-trafficking enterprise. She oversaw and trained recruiters, developed recruiting plans and helped conceal the activity from law enforcement, the lawsuit alleged."}]}
