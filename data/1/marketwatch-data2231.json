Tesla TSLA, +1.89% earlier Friday said it delivered 139,300 vehicles in the third quarter, compared with expectations of 137,000 vehicles, according to FactSet, a consensus that had stood at 140,000 in recent days. The company delivered 124,100 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, 56% more than the year-ago quarter and compared with expectations for 117,300. It delivered 15,200 Model S and Model X vehicles, 100 vehicles shy of FactSet consensus. \u201cThese numbers are particularly impressive in a year when most auto makers are producing and delivering fewer vehicles,\u201d said Karl Brauer, an analyst with iSeeCars.com. \u201cWith multiple factories coming online in the next year there\u2019s every indication Tesla\u2019s volume will continue to grow in 2021 and beyond.\u201d Analyst Joseph Spak at RBC Capital had demand concerns for the near-term. \u201cWe do believe there could be some supply constraint, but bears may also point to some potential demand concerns,\u201d Spak said. \u201cSome of the early data we\u2019ve seen in Europe suggests sales may be softer than we expected, and we continue to believe Model 3 sales in the US are down y/y (but Model Y helps U.S. demand).\u201d At last week\u2019s \u201cBattery Day,\u201d Chief Executive Elon Musk reiterated Tesla\u2019s goal to sell about half a million cars this year, or 30% to 40% higher than 2019. To hit the low end of its goal, or some 478,000 vehicles, Tesla would need to deliver 159,000 vehicles, Spak said. \u201cIt\u2019s not an unattainable goal, in our view, and is most likely dependent on the (Shanghai factory) rate continuing to increase and maybe some more efficiency out of (the Fremont, Calif., factory),\u201d he said. \u201cBut getting to 500k ... seems increasingly difficult.\u201d Dan Ives of Wedbush had a more optimistic take, saying that Tesla continues \u201cto defy the bears given the dark global COVID economic backdrop.\u201d Tesla hit \u201cthe high end of bullish whisper expectations for the quarter.\u201d Ives pinned it on China being \u201ca major source of strength this quarter.\u201d The deliveries\u2019 number \u201cshould translate into a nice EPS upside vs. the Street for 3Q with the profitability trajectory on an upward path moving forward.\u201d The Friday stock weakness is \u201ca knee-jerk reaction in a risk off tape this (morning) after a parabolic run in shares, although as the Street digests this eye popping number the stock should head higher over the coming days and weeks,\u201d he said. Related:U.S. auto sales fall 9.7% in Q3, but the news isn\u2019t all bad Tesla and Ford Motor Co. F, -1.36% were among the last auto makers to report deliveries on Friday. General Motors Co. GM, -0.15% on Thursday reported third-quarter deliveries that were 10% lower, highlighting strength in its retail sales of pickup trucks and SUVs. Ford said earlier Friday its third-quarter sales fell 4.9%. Car sales overall showed strength in September, with an annualized rate of 16.4 million units and above expectations for a third consecutive month. Inventory is still \u201ctight,\u201d and even tighter for trucks, analysts at Evercore ISI said. Retail sales \u201cshowed an encouraging trend of being roughly flat YoY while (fleet sales) positive rate-of-change trend improved again as well,\u201d they said."}]}
