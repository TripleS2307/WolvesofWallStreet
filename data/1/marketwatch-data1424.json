They did so in 2016, and they are doing so now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She urged intelligence agencies to \u00e2\u0080\u009cput more information out there\u00e2\u0080\u009d on the specific nature of the threats. An intelligence report last week said Russia was already using a \u00e2\u0080\u009crange of measures\u00e2\u0080\u009d to undercut Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, and promote Trump with misinformation on social media. The statement Friday by William Evanina, director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, also said China does not want Trump to win a second term and has accelerated its criticism of the White House, and that Iran is also hoping Trump will lose. Pelosi said trying to equate China and Russia on the threat of foreign election interference doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell the story.

Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s national-security adviser, Robert O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Brien, said Sunday that the U.S. is taking any threat to U.S. elections seriously. He said that China has engaged in cyberattacks and phishing \u00e2\u0080\u009cwith respect to our election infrastructure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to put up with it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to take every action necessary to keep folks out, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s China or Russia or Iran or Cuba or Venezuela or others.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pelosi and other congressional Democrats have expressed concern that intelligence agencies have been withholding from the public specific intelligence information about the threat of foreign interference in American politics. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe facts are chilling,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., wrote in an op-ed published Friday evening in the Washington Post. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe the American public needs and deserves to know them. The information should be declassified immediately.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pelosi spoke on CNN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cState of the Union\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cFox News Sunday\u00e2\u0080\u009dand O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Brien appeared on CBS\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u009cFace the Nation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Read on:Republican Ron Johnson subpoenas FBI documents amid Senate committee probe into origins of Trump-Russia investigation"}]}
