Amazon AMZN, +3.01% reported earnings late Thursday that nearly doubled year-over-year to $10.30 per share, with sales up 40% to $88.9 billion. E-commerce rose 47.8% to $45.9 billion in revenue. The company said online grocery sales tripled from 2019. Read:Amazon promised to spend its profit amid pandemic, but ended up with record earnings anyway \u201cWe believe contributing to this acceleration was the on boarding of older demographics, who had under indexed to e-commerce pre-pandemic, and are likely to sustain their online spend given the health consequences the virus presents and then through habit post-pandemic,\u201d SunTrust wrote. \u201cAs more customers utilize the full breadth of the Prime offering, we believe that allows Amazon to eventually 1) charge more for Prime, and 2) reinvest back into the service on behalf of customers, creating a virtuous cycle that deepens its competitive moat.\u201d SunTrust rates Amazon stock buy with a $3,600 price target, up from $3,400. SunTrust was one of at least 27 analyst groups that raised their price target on Amazon stock, with JMP Securities\u2019 price target reaching $4,075. Amazon stock has gained 70.7% in the year to date. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% is up 2% this year, and the Amplify Online Retail ETF IBUY, +1.39% has rallied 71.4%. \u201cWe expect many consumers to remain reticent to return to normal consumption patterns so long as the threat of infection is meaningful,\u201d wrote Wedbush analysts led by Michael Pachter. \u201cUntil testing capability, a therapeutic solution and a vaccine are made widely available, we expect demand for Amazon\u2019s product delivery and services to remain elevated.\u201d Wedbush rates Amazon stock outperform with a $3,700 price target, up from $3,500. Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said Prime members were active throughout the second quarter, streaming entertainment, buying goods and more.

KeyBanc Capital Markets says growth in online grocery is an \u201cattractive\u201d proposition for retail broadly, and for Amazon specifically. \u201cWe think that COVID-19 has accelerated adoption of grocery delivery by two-to-three years, at a minimum,\u201d wrote analysts led by Edward Yruma. \u201cSocial distancing within the Whole Foods Market stores and fresh fulfillment centers still remains a bit of a headwind, but we expect efficiency to continue to improve.\u201d KeyBanc rates Amazon stock overweight with a $3,500 price target, up from $3,285. Though Amazon added 175,000 new jobs since March to handle the pandemic-related surge, Daniel Elman, an analyst Nucleus Research, an IT research firm, says the company was prepared even before the spike in demand.

Here are a few things they have in common \u201cThis is a fair bit of \u2018right place at the right time\u2019 as Amazon being the leading online retailer didn\u2019t have to do a whole lot to succeed through this pandemic \u2013 aside from revamp distribution chain to meet new safety procedures \u2013 when nearly all of its brick-and-mortar competitors were forced closed for months,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter adjusting to the new influx of orders, Amazon has successfully expanded shipping operations to accommodate the increased traffic \u2013 this is critical to its continued success. The online retailer that can consistently deliver products to customers the fastest will win out in the long term.\u201d"}]}
