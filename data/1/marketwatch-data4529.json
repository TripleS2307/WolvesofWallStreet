IAG said that it didn't expect passenger demand to recover to 2019 levels until at least 2023, and that it was restructuring its cost-base to reduce the size of the group's airlines. The company also said that it was discussing a potential restructuring of the Air Europa acquisition with Globalia to take into account the effect of the coronavirus pandemic. The airline group--which houses carriers British Airways, Iberia, and Vueling among others--said that for the six months ended June 30, it made a pretax loss of EUR4.21 billion compared with a profit of EUR921 million in the year-earlier period. Net loss for the first half was EUR3.81 billion compared with a net profit of EUR806 million in the year-prior period. Revenue for the half year was EUR5.29 billion compared with EUR6.77 billion in 2019. Operating loss before exceptional items for the second quarter was EUR1.37 billion, compared with a profit of EUR960 million the year before. The company said it was deferring delivery of 68 new aircraft to 2022, from 2020. IAG reiterated that given the uncertainty of the pandemic it wasn't giving any profit guidance for 2020."}]}
