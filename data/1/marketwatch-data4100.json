With racial-justice issues a major theme in the presidential campaign, the former vice president used a speech in Wilmington, Del., to detail the newest part of his \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d plan. It includes pressing the Federal Reserve to address racial economic gaps as part of its mission. \u201cWe\u2019re going to strengthen the Federal Reserve\u2019s focus on racial economic equity,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Fed should add to that responsibility and aggressively target persistent gaps,\u201d Biden added. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } The Democratic candidate is promising to dramatically spur investment in Black-owned small businesses and encourage homeownership while closing wealth gaps among minority communities. Now see: Joe Biden wants a $15 minimum wage \u2014 will the coronavirus pandemic make that more likely? Biden wants to take $30 billion, or 10% of federal investment he\u2019s already promised as part of larger economic plans, and funnel it into a \u201cSmall Business Opportunity Fund\u201d designed to leverage $5 of private investment for minority-owned enterprises for each $1 in public funds allocated. The former vice president also plans to spend $50 billion to provide startup capital that can help entrepreneurs of color start businesses in disadvantaged areas. Last week, Biden called President Donald Trump the first racist to become president. Trump campaign adviser Katrina Pierson shot back that the president \u201cloves all people\u201d and said \u201cno one should take lectures on racial justice from Joe Biden.\u201d Biden on Tuesday said Trump is \u201cdetermined to stoke division and chaos. It\u2019s not good for the country, but Donald Trump doesn\u2019t care. His campaign is failing and he\u2019s looking for a political lifeline.\u201d Biden has previously announced plans to boost manufacturing, fight climate change and improve child care and elder care.
