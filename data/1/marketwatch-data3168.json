The supply declines from the Energy Information Administration were \u201cnot surprising,\u201d as Hurricane Laura caused a \u201cbigger draw than what was forecasted in crude and gasoline\u201d supplies, Tariq Zahir, managing member at Tyche Capital Advisors, told MarketWatch. The EIA reported Wednesday that U.S. crude inventories fell by 9.4 million barrels for the week ended Aug. 28, marking a sixth weekly decline in a row. That compared with an average forecast by analysts polled by S&P Global Platts for a fall of 1.2 million barrels. The American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday reported a drop of 6.4 million barrel. The EIA data also showed crude stocks at the Cushing, Okla., storage hub edged up by about 100,000 barrels for the week. Total U.S. crude production also dropped by 1.1 million barrels last week to stand at 9.7 million barrels a day. The drop coincides with the output shut ins related to Hurricane Laura, which touched down on the U.S. Gulf Coast early on Aug. 27. Against that backdrop, West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery CL.1, -1.62% US:CLV20 fell $1.25, or 2.9%, to settle at $41.51 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That was the lowest front-month finish since Aug. 7, according to FactSet data. November Brent crude BRN00, -0.07%, the global benchmark, lost $1.15, or 2.5%, at $44.43 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe. Hurricane Laura \u201cled to significant reductions in offshore oil production,\u201d but those \u201closses are temporary and expected during hurricane season,\u201d said Robbie Fraser, senior commodity analyst at Schneider Electric, in a note ahead of the EIA supply data. \u201cA major decline in U.S. weekly crude production won\u2019t necessarily offer much support to the market.\u201d The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement on Wednesday estimated that 19.9% of the current oil production in the Gulf of Mexico has been shut in, along with around 19.7% of natural-gas output. Around the time Laura reached the Gulf Coast last Thursday, about 84% of oil output was shut in. The EIA on Wednesday also reported that gasoline supply fell by 4.3 million barrels, while distillate stockpiles declined by 1.7 million barrels. The S&P Global Platts survey had shown expectations for supply declines of 4.7 million barrels for gasoline and 900,000 barrels for distillates. On Nymex Wednesday, October gasoline US:RBV20 fell by nearly 1.9% to $1.202 a gallon and October heating oil US:HOV20 lost 3.4% to $1.1885 a gallon. Looking ahead, there are several factors that could drive the next move for oil, said Zahir. Monthly U.S. employment data will be released Friday, and \u201cwe have already seen a weaker than expected number from ADP, which could be a forecast of what lies ahead, he said. \u201cThe bigger factor we feel will be how schools open....If we see additional schools go to remote learning, we feel that will have a demand impact on gasoline.\u201d \u201cWe would need a vaccine come to the market to see a sustained move higher\u201d in the oil market, Zahir said. \u201cBarring that, we feel the risk is to the downside in crude oil.\u201d Meanwhile, natural-gas futures finished lower Wednesday to suffer a third straight session decline, with the October contract US:NGV20 down 1.6% at $2.486 per million British thermal units. Read:Natural-gas futures gain nearly 50% in August, but rally may be \u2018short-lived\u2019 The October contract is \u201ctaking a beating versus the deferred months,\u201d said Dan Flynn, market analyst at The Price Futures Group, in a daily note. \u201cChange in temperatures must be the culprit.\u201d Still, there is \u201cno question natural gas is the wave of the future,\u201d he said. \u201cUnless there is another innovative idea to find an alternative and have the infrastructure to mass produce, this commodity is a keeper.\u201d The moves in natural gas come ahead of the EIA\u2019s weekly update on U.S. supplies of the commodity in storage. Analysts polled by S&P Global Platts expect the report Thursday to show a weekly rise of 34 billion cubic feet."}]}
