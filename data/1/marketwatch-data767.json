AP Photo/Darron Cummings LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) \u2014 A Kentucky grand jury brought no charges against Louisville police for the killing of Breonna Taylor during a drug raid gone wrong, with prosecutors saying Wednesday that two officers who fired their weapons at the woman were justified in using force to protect themselves. The grand jury instead charged fired officer Brett Hankison with three counts of wanton endangerment for firing into Taylor\u2019s neighbors\u2019 homes during the raid on the night of March 13. The FBI is still investigating potential violations of federal law in the case. See: Louisville mayor says the case is \u2018far from over\u2019 as the FBI continues to probe the matter Along with the killing of George Floyd in Minnesota, Taylor\u2019s case became a major touchstone for the nationwide protests that have gripped the nation since May \u2014 drawing attention to entrenched racism and demanding police reform. Images of Taylor, a Black emergency medical worker, has been painted on streets, emblazoned on protest signs and silkscreened on T-shirts worn by celebrities. The charges drew immediate sadness, frustration and anger that the grand jury did not go further. The wanton-endangerment charges each carry a sentence of up to five years. Protesters began marching through the streets of Louisville, where Taylor was killed, after the announcement, shouting \u201cNo justice, no peace.\u201d Some sat quietly and cried. Attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Taylor\u2019s family, called the grand jury\u2019s decision \u201coutrageous and offensive!\u201d \u201cJustice has NOT been served,\u201d tweeted Linda Sarsour of Until Freedom, a group that has pushed for charges in the case. Taylor was shot multiple times by officers who entered her home on a no-knock warrant during a narcotics investigation. The warrant used to search her home was connected to a suspect who did not live there, and no drugs were found inside. The use of no-knock warrants has since been banned by Louisville\u2019s Metro Council. The case exposed the wide gulf between public opinion on justice for those who kill Black Americans, and the laws under which those officers are charged, which regularly favor working police and do not often result in steep criminal accusations. At a news conference, state Attorney General Daniel Cameron, a Republican aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, spoke to that disconnect. \u201cCriminal law is not meant to respond to every sorrow and grief,\u201d Cameron told reporters after the charges were announced. \u201cBut my heart breaks for the loss of Miss Taylor. And I\u2019ve said that repeatedly. My mother, if something was to happen to me, would find it very hard,\u201d he added, choking up. But Cameron, who is the state\u2019s first Black attorney general, said that the officers acted in self-defense after Taylor\u2019s boyfriend fired at them. He added that Hankison and the two other officers who entered Taylor\u2019s apartment announced themselves before entering \u2014 and so did not execute the warrant as \u201cno-knock,\u201d according to the investigation. \u201cAccording to Kentucky law, the use of force by [officers Jonathan] Mattingly and [Myles] Cosgrove was justified to protect themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cThis justification bars us from pursuing criminal charges in Miss Breonna Taylor\u2019s death.\u201d Taylor\u2019s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, opened fire when police burst in, hitting Mattingly. Walker was charged with attempted murder of a police officer, but prosecutors later dropped the charge. Walker told police he heard knocking but didn\u2019t know who was coming into the home and fired in self-defense. Regarding the disappointment of those who wanted criminal charges brought in Taylor\u2019s death, he remarked, \u201cThe decision before my office as the special prosecutor in this case was not to decide if the loss of Ms. Taylor\u2019s life was a tragedy. The answer to that is unequivocally yes.\u201d The McConnell prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Cameron, who has been tagged by some as the Senate veteran\u2019s heir apparent, had his name appear among the 20 on President Donald Trump\u2019s list to fill a future Supreme Court vacancy. Before charges were brought, Hankison was fired from the city\u2019s police department on June 23. A termination letter sent to him by interim Louisville Police Chief Robert Schroeder said the white officer had violated procedures by showing \u201cextreme indifference to the value of human life\u201d when he \u201cwantonly and blindly\u201d shot 10 rounds of gunfire into Taylor\u2019s apartment in March. See: Louisville to pay $12 million to Breonna Taylor\u2019s family Hankison had already been placed on administrative reassignment, as were Sgt. Johnathan Mattingly, officer Myles Cosgrove and the detective who sought the warrant, Joshua Jaynes. On Sept. 15, the city settled a lawsuit against the three officers brought by Taylor\u2019s mother, Tamika Palmer, agreeing to pay her $12 million and enact police reforms. Protesters in Louisville and across the country have demanded justice for Taylor and other Black people killed by police in recent months. The release in late May of a 911 call by Taylor\u2019s boyfriend marked the beginning of days of protests in Louisville, fueled by her shooting and the killing of Floyd while at the hands of police in Minneapolis on May 25. Several prominent African American celebrities including Oprah Winfrey and Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles have joined those urging that the officers be charged."}]}
