Northern California\u00e2\u0080\u0099s August Complex fire reached a grim milestone on Monday, becoming the first in modern history to burn more than a million acres, which some experts are calling a \u00e2\u0080\u009cgigafire.\u00e2\u0080\u009d While the prefix \u00e2\u0080\u009cgiga\u00e2\u0080\u009d actually refers to \u00e2\u0080\u009cbillion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cmega\u00e2\u0080\u009d means \u00e2\u0080\u009cmillion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the term \u00e2\u0080\u009cmegafire\u00e2\u0080\u009d was already being used to describe blazes that scorched more than 100,000 acres.

August lightning strikes sparked several smaller fires that have converged into the inferno raging across seven counties. It has been burning for more than 50 days. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first gigafire. The last million-acre blaze was the 2004 Taylor Complex in Alaska, which burned about 1.3 million acres, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Prior to that, the 1998 Yellowstone Fire in Montana and Idaho burned about 1.58 million acres, and The Great Fire of 1910 burned more than 3 million acres, also across Idaho and Montana. And earlier this year, before the pandemic began dominating headlines, Australia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bushfires reached gigafire status when two fires merged to char about 1.5 million acres on the border between Victoria and New South Wales.

Blazes have burned four million acres across the state, which is more than double the previous record set in 2018. The fires have killed at least 31 people so far, and destroyed more than 8,000 structures. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more, five of the six largest fires ever recorded in the Golden State happened this year, spewing smoke and ash so thick at times that it blocked out the sun, raising health concerns about the millions of residents exposed to air pollution as a result. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Such major wildfires are now three times more common across the western U.S. than they were in the 1970s, according to a Climate Central analysis. Scientists have blamed climate change intensifying these fires by creating conditions primed to spark wildfires, including summer temperatures rising and drying out more vegetation that can fuel bigger fires, as well as making wildfire season three months longer. The White House has disagreed, however, with Trump telling California\u00e2\u0080\u0099s secretary for natural resources in September that, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll start getting cooler.\u00e2\u0080\u009d What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more, skyrocketing home prices and rents in cities such as San Francisco, San Jose and Los Angeles have priced out many working-class and middle-class Californians, and pushed them to move into areas that are high-risk for these wildfires.
