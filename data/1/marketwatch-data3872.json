The U.S. has averaged more than 1,000 deaths a day for two weeks, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. Wednesday\u2019s deaths were mostly concentrated in Sun Belt states that saw the worst case spikes in June and July, the New York Times reported. A Times analysis of data provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that at least 200,000 more Americans than usual have died since March, or about 60,000 more than the official data is linking to COVID-19. The findings were in line with a report published by \u201cThe Conversation.\u201d See also:The \u2018excess deaths\u2019 tally in the U.S. is 204,691 in 7 months \u2014 so COVID-19 deaths might be undercounted While case numbers are stabilizing in some regions, the high number of deaths suggests the pandemic is far from under control. President Donald Trump continued to push for schools to reopen on time and in person on Wednesday and to urge football players to \u201cgo play football.\u201d Ahead of Trump\u2019s briefing, former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, made his first public appearance with Sen. Kamala Harris, his newly announced running mate. The pair slammed Trump\u2019s management of the pandemic, pledged to bring back lost jobs and prop up the middle class. \u201cI\u2019m ready to get to work,\u201d said Harris. The U.S. leads the world in coronavirus cases \u201cbecause of Trump\u2019s failure to take it seriously from the start,\u201d she said. In other developments: \u2022 Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis compared the challenge of reopening schools with the obstacles faced by the U.S. Navy SEAL team that assassinated Osama bin Laden in 2011. \u201cJust as the SEALs surmounted obstacles to bring Osama bin Laden to justice, so too would the Martin County School system find a way to provide parents with a meaningful choice of in-person instruction or continued distance learning,\u201d he said at a briefing, according to a transcript published on Florida\u2019s government website See now: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis likens reopening schools to killing Osama bin Laden \u2022 Dr. Michael Osterholm, epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, repeated his message that the U.S. needs to shut down again and go back to Square 1 in dealing with the crisis, which he acknowledged is \u201cshocking news\u201d that people \u201cdon\u2019t want to hear.\u201d \u201cThe bottom line is that if you look at the country, we are an anomaly among the higher-income countries of the world in that we never did lock down sufficiently; we only slowed down to get the virus activity by May to a so-so level,\u201d Osterholm said in an interview on MSNBC. \u201cOther countries worked harder to get the viral activity more fully under control. \u2018We walked away after 80% containment.\u201d Don\u2019t miss: Dr. Osterholm: Americans will be living with the coronavirus for decades \u2022 India now has the fourth highest death toll from COVID-19 in the world, after passing the U.K. overnight, the Johns Hopkins data shows. India has 2.4 million cases, or third highest after the U.S. and Brazil, and 47,033 deaths. \u2022 There was bad news from China where two people who were confirmed to have had and recovered from the virus have tested positive again, according to media reports. A 68-year old woman in the Chinese province of Hubei, where the virus was first detected late last year, tested positive this month after recovering from COVID-19 in February. A man who was confirmed to have the illness in April also tested positive again, although media reports said he was not suffering any symptoms. Other anecdotal evidence relating to patients retesting positive after apparently recovering have made health experts concerned that the level of protective antibodies developed to fight the virus may quickly fall away and leave patients at risk of reinfection. \u2022 Germany reported 1,445 new COVID-19 cases in a single day, the highest number since May 1, according to the Robert Koch Institute. \u201cThis trend is unsettling,\u201d the RKI said in a statement. \u201cWe absolutely have to avoid a further accentuation of the situation.\u201d Germany\u2019s most populous state, North Rhine Westphalia in the West and Hamburg in the North are showing the biggest increases in new cases. Germany has been widely admired for its success in containing the pandemic. The country has 221,219 confirmed cases and 9,217 deaths for a mortality rate of 4.2%, Johns Hopkins data shows, or 11.11 deaths per 100,000 people. That compares with the UK\u2019s 14.8% mortality rate, equal to 70.37 deaths per 100,000 people. The U.S. mortality rate is 3.2% or 50.75 deaths per 100,000 people, the data shows.Latest tallies There are now 751,033 confirmed deaths from COVID-19 world-wide, the Johns Hopkins data shows.

The number of Americans applying for jobless benefits fell below 1 million in the latest week for the first time since the start of the pandemic, signaling a steady if slow revival in a battered U.S. labor market, MarketWatch\u2019s Jeffry Bartash reported. New applications for unemployment benefits, a rough gauge of layoffs, declined to 963,000 last week from 1.19 million at the end of July, the Labor Department said Thursday. It was the second straight large decline, raising questions about whether the end of a temporary $600 federal unemployment stipend prompted more people to return to work or start looking for jobs again. New claims have tumbled by almost 500,000 in the past two weeks. Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast 1.08 million new claims in the seven days ended Aug. 8. These seasonally adjusted figures reflect applications filed the traditional way through state unemployment offices.

The increase in import prices over the past three months is the largest since 2011. Despite this advance, import prices declined 3.3% over the past year. The gain in July was led by fuel prices, which rose 6.9% in July. The gains over the past three months in imported fuel prices is the largest since 1990. Still, fuel prices are down 32.8% over the past 12 months. Import prices excluding fuels rose 0.2% in July. Export prices rose 0.8% in July and are down 4.4% over the past year.
