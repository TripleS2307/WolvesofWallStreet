The taxi fleets have most of the taxis in storage,\u201d said Sergio Cabrera, a longtime cabdriver and member of advocacy group Yellow Taxi United. \u201cIn 21 years of driving, I\u2019ve never seen it like this.\u201d With anger among taxi drivers hitting a breaking point, the Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) planned to announce a six-month pause on new licenses for for-hire vehicles, a move that could stem the tide of new competition, including from disrupters Lyft LYFT, +2.16% and Uber UBER, -0.18% . A formal announcement is expected on Friday. But the move does little to address drivers\u2019 main demand for debt relief. The city\u2019s yellow-cab drivers felt the full force of the blow when the coronavirus pandemic hit New York, with trips plummeting 84% from their pre-COVID levels by early April. And while there\u2019s been a slow trickle of returning passengers over the past several months and new relief efforts by the city\u2019s TLC, drivers say it\u2019s still not nearly enough to sustain business as usual \u2014 or to pay back expensive medallion loans. With Manhattan still largely devoid of office workers and tourists, Cabrera said, drivers are turning to the outer boroughs for fares. Coronavirus update: Global cases near 30 million; Trump contradicts CDC head on vaccine timetable and again derides face masks \u201cIn the outer boroughs where the average people live, there is much more movement,\u201d Cabrera said. \u201cManhattan is not busy, it\u2019s not functioning the way it should be. I don\u2019t know when it\u2019s going to come back.\u201d The strain on the city\u2019s taxi drivers is compounded by years of tightening margins and spiraling debt, as competition from apps like Uber and Lyft has flooded city streets, and declining values of the high-price medallions required to operate have left many drivers hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. In 2018, then-taxi commissioner Meera Joshi characterized a spate of driver suicides as \u201can epidemic\u201d in the industry. \u201cCOVID is just the latest problem,\u201d said Carolyn Protz, a driver and member of Yellow Taxi United as well as the NYC Taxi Medallion Owner Driver Association. \u201cOur problems as medallion owners go back much longer.\u201d Members of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, a union representing both yellow cab and Uber/Lyft drivers, had staged Thursday\u2019s slowdowns on the Brooklyn and Queensboro bridges to draw attention to demands for debt forgiveness for medallion owners. Representatives of alliance did not respond to multiple requests for comment. As with many issues facing small-business owners in the pandemic, city officials say that further support and bailout money should come from the federal government and financial institutions, rather than local government agencies already facing budget cuts and potential layoffs. \u201cThe city is obviously in a financial crisis. There\u2019s not a current opportunity for a traditional bailout for medallion owners who are indebted to banks,\u201d TLC Commissioner Aloysee Heredia Jarmoszuk told MarketWatch. \u201cIt would require federal action and some regulation for banks that may have taken advantage of medallion owners who find themselves with higher interest and untenable loans.\u201d Last week, it was reported that Connecticut-based investment firm Marblegate Asset Management LLC has recently forgiven $70 million worth of medallion debt, and in some cases capped individual owners\u2019 debts at a ceiling of $300,000. The average driver-owner carries $600,000 in medallion debt, according to the TWA, and over the past decade, medallion prices had been inflated from around $200,000 to as high as $1 million, an investigation from the New York Times found last year. Advocates say it\u2019s a helpful step, but more aid is needed. \u201cEven the amount that they\u2019ve lowered the debt, it\u2019s an undoable amount of money to make those payments on a monthly basis,\u201d said Cabrera, the cabdriver and advocate. \u201cMost of the banks have a forbearance going on medallion payments right now, so that has helped. But we need massive debt relief. We need the city to step in.\u201d At the height of the pandemic, the TLC launched the Get Food NYC food delivery program, paying licensed taxi drivers to deliver meals to vulnerable New Yorkers. More than 20,000 drivers have participated in the delivery of over 100 million meals since March, according to city data, collectively earning close to $40 million, Jarmoszuk said. \u201cWe have a lot of problems, we cannot deny that,\u201d Jarmoszuk added. \u201cThese things did not happen overnight. It could have been far worse, but we were able to put supports in place to lessen the blow. Solutions [will take time] but they will happen.\u201d Also on MarketWatch: New York City schools delay in-person instruction \u2014 again Still, drivers are concerned about their debt, and what the industry will look like on the other side of the current crisis. \u201cMy concern is for the future, after COVID,\u201d Protz said. \u201cGoing forward, there need to be many less for-hire vehicles [on the road].\u201d \u201cI\u2019m in the Bronx by the [Bronx Terminal Market],\u201d Cabrera said. \u201cI\u2019ll sit here until a call comes through or someone comes out of the mall. The days are long. The income is not where it needs to be to make any kind of payment on what I owe.\u201d"}]}
