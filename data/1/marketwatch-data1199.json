The Times, which obtained a copy of the book in advance of its publication, reports Bolton writes about episodes where Trump expressed willingness to halt criminal investigations \"to, in effect, give personal favors to dictators he liked,\" citing cases involving major companies in China and Turkey. The Trump administration sued Bolton on Tuesday to delay the publication of the book, which the White House says contains classified information, though advance copies were already in the hands of journalists and book reviewers. Trump also asked Chinese President Xi Jinping to buy U.S. farm products, in order to help him win agricultural states in the November election, Bolton writes, according to the Times."}]}
