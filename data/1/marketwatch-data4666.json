The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% finished 205.49 points lower, or 0.8%, at 26,379.28, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% shed 20.97 points, or 0.7%, ending at 3,218.44, after briefly trading positive.

The Nasdaq Composite advanced 173.09 points to end at 10,536.27, a 1.7% gain. What drove the market? Stocks ended lower Tuesday as investors migrated toward businesses that may benefit from economic recovery after taking a hit from the global pandemic, but the gains were not enough to offset sharp selling in a number of high-profile companies. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCLH, +2.91% and Regency Centers Corp. REG, -2.12%, a shopping center real-estate investment trust, ended the day higher, as did American Airlines Group Inc. AAL, +0.34%, United Airlines HoldingInc. UAL, +0.32% and Delta Air Lines Inc. DAL, +0.39%. But stocks that already have done well from online shopping and work-from-home rules during the pandemic lost ground, including Netflix NFLX, +1.43% and Alphabet GOOG, +1.97%. Investors also sold shares of Dow components 3M Co. MMM, +0.94% and McDonald\u2019s Corp. MCD, -0.43%, which reported second-quarter earnings that fell short of Wall Street expectations and pulled the Dow lower. Still, the shift reinforced hopes that sentiment finally might start to shift toward value sectors and away from large-cap growth stocks that in recent months have been responsible for powering major equity indexes higher. \u201cOne or two days is not a trend, but it\u2019s welcome news for those who have owned value entities,\u201d said Kent Engelke, chief economic strategist at Capitol Securities Management, in an interview. Related: Future returns: REITs should rise as economy recovers Senate Republicans\u2019 roughly $1 trillion coronavirus relief package also was in focus, as negotiations kicked off with Democrats over another fiscal stimulus bill that comes amid recent economic data suggesting the U.S. economic recovery is stalling. A fight looms over supplemental unemployment benefits, with Democrats eager to maintain the existing $600 weekly supplement, while the Republican plan would reduce it to a $200 add-on through September. The supplemental jobless benefits are due to expire at the end of the month. Democrats and Republicans also want to issue another round of stimulus checks, but disagree on the details. See:Republicans and Democrats both want another round of stimulus checks \u2014 but here\u2019s where they disagree Analysts said the added jobless benefits have been credited with helping to cushion the economic blow of the COVID-19 pandemic. \u201cIn our view, for equities to continue yesterday\u2019s rebound, a common ground should be found before Friday when the enhanced unemployment benefits expire,\u201d said Charalambos Pissouros, senior market analyst at JFD Group. Pissouros said a package near $1 trillion or lower would likely come as a disappointment to the market. Meanwhile, the number of U.S. coronavirus cases rose to 4.29 million and the death toll hit 148,056. Texas became the fourth state with more than 400,000 cases, joining California, Florida and New York. The global tally for confirmed cases of COVID-19 climbed to 16.5 million on Tuesday, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University, while the death toll rose to 654,327. Aside from rising case counts, Major League Baseball also has become a harbinger of the nation\u2019s attempts to contain the coronavirus, after 17 players from the Miami Marlins this week were reported as testing positive for COVID-19, forcing the team\u2019s scheduled games to be suspended through Sunday. \u201cYou listen to earnings and some have been particularly bad,\u201d Jason Ader, chief executive officer of SpringOwl Asset Management, told MarketWatch. \u201cBut bad earnings aren\u2019t the driver. Amazingly, there\u2019s more focus on if there will be a baseball season or not.\u201d On the vaccine front, Moderna Inc. MRNA, +0.09% kicked off its late-stage trial while Pfizer Inc PFE, -0.27% and BioNTech BNTX, +1.23% entered late-stage trials of their candidates also. The Federal Reserve also began a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday that\u2019s unlikely to result in much action, but is expected to see Chairman Jerome Powell underline a willingness to take further action to support the economy and maintain easy financial conditions. The Fed on Tuesday announced that its board of governors had decided to extend until the end of the year several emergency loan programs that had been set to expire on Sept. 30. The extensions should shore up confidence around markets that have surged back from a COVID-19-induced panic in large part due to monetary stimulus provided by the Fed, said Thomas Kee, chief executive of Stock Traders Daily, in a note. \u201cThe FOMC remains \u2018locked and loaded\u2019 and now the hedge funds that piggyback the FOMC have the extended confidence that the [Federal Open Market Committee] will be there to buy more if the market experiences the slightest amount of trouble through the end of the year,\u201d he wrote, referring to the Fed\u2019s policy-setting panel. \u201cThe FOMC has the facilities in place to do it without any policy adjustments.\u201d In U.S. economic data, the Case-Shiller home price index for May rose 3.7% annually. The Conference Board\u2019s consumer-confidence index fell to 92.6 in July from a revised 98.3 reading in June. Economists polled by MarketWatch had expected a reading of 96.0. The measure of how consumers feel about the economy right now actually rose to 94.2 in July from 86.7, but the subindex that gauges expectations about the future fell to a four-month low 91.5 from 106.1 in June. \u201cThe data signals that consumers, in the face of rising virus cases and a reversal in labor market gains, are becoming more cautious about the continued healing of the economy,\u201d wrote economists Kathy Bostjancic and Gregory Daco of Oxford Economics, in a note. \u201cWhile the present situations index increased on the month, if the economy does not regain forward momentum, we are likely to see some retrenchment in the present assessment soon.\u201dWhich companies were in focus? Pfizer Inc. PFE, -0.27% shares gained 3.9% after beating earnings and revenue expectations and raising its full-year outlook. 3M Co.
