Joe Biden defines that threshold as \u00e2\u0080\u009cwealthy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and, according to CNBC, those making that much money represent the top 1.8% of taxpayers, but the reality on the ground in pricy big cities tells a different story. In fact, at least one financial number-cruncher says that kind of salary barely covers the bills in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, etc. Read: How rich is the \u00e2\u0080\u0098middle class\u00e2\u0080\u0099? \u00e2\u0080\u009cBased on the expenses, a $400,000 household income provides for a relatively middle-class lifestyle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d popular \u00e2\u0080\u009cFinancial Samurai\u00e2\u0080\u009d blogger was quoted as saying on CNBC. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA middle-class lifestyle is defined as: owning a home, having two kids, saving for retirement, saving for college, going on modest vacations several weeks a year, and retiring in one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s early 60s.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how he breaks it down: So $400,000 a year leaves you with $34? Of course, that includes maxing out your 401(k), owning a nice home, taking a vacation, etc. Not a lot of tears are being shed by those who earn much less and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make ends meet, but still, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to see why someone with that kind of salary doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly feel wealthy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are not living it up on $400,000 a year,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Financial Samurai said.

People with adjusted gross incomes at or below $400,000 would have a 0.9% average decrease in after-tax income, while people making that threshold would see a 17.7% after-tax income drop, according to\u00c2 a budget model\u00c2 from the Wharton School of Business."}]}
