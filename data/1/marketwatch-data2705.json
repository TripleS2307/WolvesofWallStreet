Data Tuesday showed that the ISM manufacturing survey rose to 56 in August, from 54.2. The dollar shook off earlier weakness following the report, with the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, -0.58% up 0.2% at 92.306 as gold futures settled, after touching a low of 91.746, the lowest since spring 2018.

Prices, however, had traded as high as $2,001.20 during the session. The Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to alter its monetary-policy framework to allow for inflation to rise above, or below, its 2% annual target for longer periods, has weakened the dollar, with the dollar index down more than 1% last month, and provided more incentive for buyers of bullion who see gold as a inflation hedge, analysts say. \u201cThe Fed\u2019s decisions and the new inflation target opened space for a new rally for gold,\u201d wrote Carlo Alberto De Casa, chief analyst at ActivTrades, in a Tuesday report. Read:Brainard says Fed should shift to more aggressive strategy to boost the economy The gains for gold and other precious metals come even as the U.S. stock market traded mostly higher to start September, a month that has historically been a weaker performer than others. \u201cDespite U.S. indices continuing to rally, investors feel the need to increase the proportion of gold in their portfolio in case of new turbulence on both stocks and currencies markets,\u201d De Casa wrote. December silver contract SIZ20, +5.96% SI00, +5.96%, meanwhile, added 5 cents, or 0.2%, at $28.645 an ounce, following a 2.9% rise on Monday. \u201cOnce again, it seems to be silver which is leading gold higher and doing it in leveraged style, outperforming gold in London time roughly twofold in terms of the percent increase,\u201d Ross Norman, chief executive officer of precious-metals news and information provider Metals Daily, told MarketWatch. \u201cThe market is looking to retake the $2,000 level in the near term\u201d and will be eyeing recent all-time highs, he said. Most-active gold futures reached a record high settlement of $2,069.40 on Aug. 6. \u201cThe biggest vulnerability to gold is a correction in the equity market which could prompt short term selling in gold to fund margin calls,\u201d said Norman. \u201cPhysical demand remains brisk with retail investors joining central banks and institutional investors in acquiring the yellow metal.\u201d In other Comex action, prices for copper eased back, with the December contract HGZ20, +1.38% down 1.1% at $3.0285 a pound.
