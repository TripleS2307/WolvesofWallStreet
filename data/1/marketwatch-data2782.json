The small-cap Russell 2000 index RUT, +0.55% added 1.8%, a sign investors are looking for value among companies that haven\u2019t benefited from the massive run-up enjoyed by tech giants so far this year. On Friday, the Dow put in a weekly loss of 0.2%, while the S&P 500 gained 1.7% and the Nasdaq surged 3.7% over the period.

In economic data, the Institute for Supply Management reported that its manufacturing gauge rose to a reading of 54.2, while new orders jumped to 61.5. MarketWatch-polled analysts had forecast the purchasing managers index to rise to 53.6, from 52.6 in June. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion in factory activity. \u201cThe ongoing uncertainty around the virus and state of the economy still raises questions on the sustainability of the rebound in manufacturing. The strong July report provides further confirmation of improvement in recent months,\u201d said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors. A raft of stronger-than-expected manufacturing purchasing managers indexes in Europe and in China, signaling a steadying global economy, helped to set the stage for the upthrust in the market. For all that, there are still no signs of a stimulus package agreement between Democrats and Republicans after negotiations over the weekend failed to yield a replacement for a $600-a-week boost to unemployment benefits that expired Friday. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin revealed clear fault lines in negotiations between the parties during Sunday talk shows. Pelosi said that \u201cwe\u2019ll be close to an agreement when we have\u2026an agreement,\u201d speaking to ABC\u2019s Martha Raddatz on \u201cThis Week.\u201d At issue for Democrats and Republicans is the amount of unemployment assistance for Americans. The White House has come out in favor of reducing the federal assistance to $200 a week, Democrats have called for keeping it at $600 a week. However, the parties appear to both support a fresh round of stimulus checks of $1,200 for workers. The fight for aid for out-of-work Americans comes ahead of Friday\u2019s July report on the labor market that will be examined to determine the impact on employment as cases of the infection have steadily risen in a number of states. Indeed, coronavirus infections in the U.S. reached a record in July, with more than 1.9 million new cases. The U.S. has nearly 4.7 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and about 155,000 deaths, while the global tally for infections stands at more than 18 million and almost 690,000 deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Meanwhile, investors may focus on developments between Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +2.48% and video-sharing app TikTok, owned by a Chinese company, ByteDance.

Trump on Monday suggested the U.S. government should get part of the proceeds of any sale of TikTok. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo over the weekend said that the White House may take action against other Chinese software companies, highlighting elevated tensions between Beijing and Washington. On the Federal Reserve front, Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said the economic rebound this quarter \u201cis more muted\u201d than expected and, as a result, the unemployment rate this year will likely be higher than previously thought.Which stocks were in focus?
