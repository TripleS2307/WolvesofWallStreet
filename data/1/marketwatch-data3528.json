We had something where it gave you a disincentive to work last time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The president's remarks came during an interview with Fox Business Network that aired Wednesday. They echo June 10 comments from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who said the Trump administration would \"seriously look at whether we want to do more direct money to stimulate the economy.\" The Democratic-run House passed a $3 trillion coronavirus relief bill in May that would provide a second round of direct payments, at $1,200 per family member with a limit of $6,000 per household. The sweeping House measure championed by Speaker Nancy Pelosi was widely viewed as an opening offer in talks about another package with the Republican-controlled Senate and the Trump administration.

The president spoke as well about wearing face masks during the coronavirus pandemic, after Biden criticized Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reluctance to wear personal protective equipment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m all for masks. I think masks are good,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI had a mask on. I sort of liked the way I looked. I thought it was OK. It was a dark, black mask, and I thought it looked OK \u00e2\u0080\u0094 looked like the Lone Ranger.\u00e2\u0080\u009d See:Biden says \u00e2\u0080\u0098very top\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of government should call for mask wearing, in jab at Trump He also reiterated in the interview his often-stated view that, one day, the virus will simply disappear, answering the Fox Business reporter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s question of whether he still believed that: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Fox Business Network\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parent company, Fox Corp.
