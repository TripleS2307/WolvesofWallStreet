We had something where it gave you a disincentive to work last time.\" The president's remarks came during an interview with Fox Business Network that aired Wednesday. They echo June 10 comments from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who said the Trump administration would \"seriously look at whether we want to do more direct money to stimulate the economy.\" The Democratic-run House passed a $3 trillion coronavirus relief bill in May that would provide a second round of direct payments, at $1,200 per family member with a limit of $6,000 per household. The sweeping House measure championed by Speaker Nancy Pelosi was widely viewed as an opening offer in talks about another package with the Republican-controlled Senate and the Trump administration.

The president spoke as well about wearing face masks during the coronavirus pandemic, after Biden criticized Trump's reluctance to wear personal protective equipment. \"I'm all for masks. I think masks are good,\" he said. \"I had a mask on. I sort of liked the way I looked. I thought it was OK. It was a dark, black mask, and I thought it looked OK - looked like the Lone Ranger.\" See:Biden says 'very top' of government should call for mask wearing, in jab at Trump He also reiterated in the interview his often-stated view that, one day, the virus will simply disappear, answering the Fox Business reporter's question of whether he still believed that: \"I do.\" He added, \"I hope.\" Fox Business Network's parent company, Fox Corp.
