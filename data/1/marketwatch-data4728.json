Shelton\u2019s bid has languished since her confirmation hearing in February amid talk she didn\u2019t have enough committee support. Shelton, who was an informal Trump adviser during his presidential campaign, has been a longtime advocate for some form of tying the dollar\u2019s value to gold. She likely faces unanimous opposition from Democrats and some Republicans were on the fence. The committee will also vote on a second Trump Fed nominee, Christopher Waller, the director of research at the St. Louis Fed. Waller is expected to be confirmed easily. It was unclear whether Shelton had won over Republican skeptics or if Sen. Mike Crapo, the Republican from Idaho who chairs the committee, is trying to force the issue. A spokesman for Crapo was unavailable for comment. Crapo has previously hesitated to bring her nomination to a committee vote because Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, remained undecided. If Kennedy voted with all the Democrats on the panel, Shelton\u2019s nomination would be defeated 13-12. Asked last month why he\u2019s taking so long to make up his mind, Kennedy replied: \u201cI\u2019m a slow reader.\u201d \u201cI think unfortunately the last three or four months has demonstrated just how important the Federal Reserve is,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd Dr. Shelton has written a book and a number of white papers and a number of op-ed pieces and I\u2019m going to try to read as many of them as I can.\u201d A spokesman for Kennedy was unavailable to comment this afternoon. In reaction to the news of that the vote on Shelton had been set, all the Senate Democrats on the panel wrote a letter urging Crapo to hold another hearing on the nomination. Based on her answers at the February hearing, \u201cwe are deeply concerned that the situation we are in today would have been worse if Dr. Shelton were sitting on the Board of Governors,\u201d the Democrats wrote. Announcement of the Shelton vote came after the market close. Stocks finished strongly higher on Friday as investors pushed aside worries about the pandemic. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% finished up 369 points, or 1.4% to 26,075."}]}
