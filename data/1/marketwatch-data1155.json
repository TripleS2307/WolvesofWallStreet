Tesla TSLA, +1.89% said that it delivered roughly 90,650 vehicles in the second quarter, ahead of the 72,000 deliveries that analysts surveyed by FactSet had been predicting. Tesla\u2019s actual delivery count, its proxy for sales, also came in comfortably above even the highest estimate tracked by FactSet, which was 86,000. The stock rose nearly 9%, trading as high as $1,228, putting it on track for another closing record. Tesla delivered 80,050 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles combined in the period, as well as 10,600 Model S and Model X vehicles in aggregate. The company announced that it produced 82,000 vehicles in the June quarter, though production in its main Fremont, Calif., factory was shut down for much of the quarter. Tesla\u2019s factory there is now producing cars back at pre-pandemic levels, the company said. Read: Some workers complain Tesla has threatened firings if they don\u2019t return to work \u201cIn our opinion, a 90,000 delivery number in this COVID lockdown environment is a jaw dropper and the bulls will run with this as a potential paradigm changer moving ahead,\u201d Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote after the delivery numbers came out, calling the numbers a \u201cmajor home run.\u201d His research indicates that China \u201cappeared to be the star of the show\u201d in the second quarter, though Tesla didn\u2019t provide any regional breakdowns in its release. Prior to Tesla\u2019s delivery report, Ives upped his price target on the stock to $1,250 from $1,000, even while maintaining a neutral rating. He also said that his bull case target is now $2,000. Don\u2019t miss: These stocks, including Tesla and Apple, are the real winners for the second quarter of 2020 Analyst Garrett Nelson at CFRA increased his price target on Tesla shares by $400 to $1,100, implying 10% downside. Tesla was likely sitting on high inventory at the end of March, which contributed to the stronger-than-expected sales total, he said in a note. Garrett kept his hold rating on the stock. The market is giving Tesla \u201cample credit for future cash flow growth and (we) are reluctant to recommend purchase of the shares at these levels,\u201d he said. Joseph Spak of RBC Capital also struck a more cautious note, seeing \u201csigns of trouble\u201d for Tesla\u2019s older vehicle models and in markets where Teslas are not a novelty anymore. \u201cYes, (Tesla) was able to show good headline numbers relative to an auto industry that really felt impact of COVID-19,\u201d he said. But Tesla benefited from entering China, where it had previously sold cars but started making cars only this year. \u201cThis of course, counts as growth, and new markets/products is part of the Tesla story,\u201d but assuming about 30,000 Model 3s made in China, then that means that Model 3 and Model Y sales in the rest of the world, mainly mature markets such as North America and Europe, were down about 36% on the year, he said. \u201cAnd, recall, there were North America/Europe price cuts on the (Model 3) this quarter, a move we generally view as one to stimulate demand. So once again we see some evidence that a Tesla product matures quickly after entering a market and pent-up demand is satisfied,\u201d Spak wrote in the note. \u201cCredit where credit is due to Tesla \u2014 but perhaps the most amazing thing about (Tesla) stock is the power of the narrative,\u201d he said. Tesla\u2019s quarterly deliveries \u201care further evidence that Tesla has the auto industry backed into a corner,\u201d Gene Munster of Loup Ventures, a former Wall Street analyst turned venture capitalist, said in a note. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming more and more difficult to envision a scenario in which legacy auto makers will find a way to meaningful expand the small share of EVs that they have today.\u201d General Motors Co. GM, -0.15% on Wednesday reported second-quarter sales that were down 34%, while Toyota Motor Corp.\u2019s TM, -0.65% sales fell by about one-third and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCAU, -0.95% reported a 39% decline. Auto makers offered discounts and financing deals to lure buyers, but these weren\u2019t enough to offset factory and dealership closures due to the pandemic. \u201cTesla is winning because they have a product that is measurably better than both gas and electric competitors,\u201d Munster said. Concerns that Tesla would eventually run out of cash and would not be able to make cars at a scale have been \u201cmeaningfully diminished.\u201d As Tesla reports second-quarter results, the concern that the company is structurally unprofitable will also fade away. Based on the Thursday\u2019s sales numbers, the company is likely to report better-than-expected profit in a month or so, he said. One concern remains, Munster said: Stock valuation. \u201cIf Tesla can continue to capture 70-80% share of the US EV market, we expect shares to remain richly valued and continue higher given the vast market potential,\u201d he said. Tesla shares have rallied nearly 150% over the past three months and they\u2019ve gained 400% over the past 12 months. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% is up 23% over a three-month span and 4.8% over the past year."}]}
