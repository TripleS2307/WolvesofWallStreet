PSTH.U, , a special purpose acquisition (SPAC), or blank check company, formed by billionaire investor Bill Ackman, raised $4 billion as its initial public offering of 200 million shares priced at $20 a share. The company is set to go public on Wednesday. In connection with the IPO, Ackman's Pershing Square funds has committed to buy at least $1 billion worth of equity units, each consisting of one share of common stock and one-third of one redeemable warrant at a price of $20 per unit. That will give Pershing Square Tontine a minimum of $5 billion of cash equity capital, which the company plans to use to merge with one private company and take it public. The SPAC is going public at a good time for IPOs, as the Renaissance IPO ETF IPO, +1.98% has soared 40.4% year to date, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% has ticked up 0.8%."}]}
