Back in the 1990s, when I worked at Money magazine, David Lereah was a go-to source for our real estate stories. His job then: chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association (he later held that job at the National Association of Realtors). I lost track of Lereah until his new, and wholly surprising, book recently arrived: \u201cThe Power of Positive Aging.\u201d And boy does he have a story to tell. At age 62, a few years ago, Lereah was diagnosed with stage 3 esophageal cancer. \u201cThe doctor looked at me and he didn\u2019t say \u2018You\u2019re going to be fine, we will beat this,\u2019\u201d Lereah told me. \u201cHe said, \u2018This is going to be most difficult challenge of your life and I don\u2019t have any guarantees.\u2019 He scared the s*** out of me. As he left the room, the nurse looked at me and said: \u2018David, if you beat this cancer, it was only an inconvenience in your life.\u2019 And that really rang a bell for me.\u201d The nurse\u2019s words also changed pretty much everything about the way Lereah, who lives in Port St. Lucie, Fla., now looks at life and the way he deals with aging. And it\u2019s why he felt compelled to write the \u201cPositive Aging\u201d book \u2014 to help others see the light \u2014 and to start the United We Age nonprofit group. Here are highlights from my conversation with Lereah: Next Avenue: How are you feeling? What is your life like these days? David Lereah: I\u2019m feeling very good, actually. I still have some physical limits. I sleep on a 45-degree angle because they had to cut half of my stomach out and half of my esophagus is gone. I have some endurance issues as well. So, there are some real physical limitations. But, as the theme of the book stresses, I\u2019ve got such a positive outlook that these things don\u2019t annoy me. I am now a walker and walk 10,000 to 12,000 steps a day; that\u2019s over 5 miles. On a good day, I walk 15,000 steps. It\u2019s not a big deal that I no longer play golf or tennis because I can\u2019t bend down to pick up the balls. I just no longer have expectations to play them.\u2018We don\u2019t know how to grow old\u2019 You write in the book that we don\u2019t know how to grow old. Why do you say that? I break down aging into three aging \u2018rooms:\u2019 the Positive Aging Room, the Practical Aging Room and God\u2019s Waiting Room. Most of us are in the Practical Aging Room and that\u2019s a good one. It means you will try to age gracefully. Maybe you have a bucket list of things do to find meaning in life. But you will have some bouts of anxiety over thinking about mortality. You will have depression on occasion when something significant happens to you, either a serious physical decline or mental decline. It\u2019s going to jolt us and most of us are not prepared to handle a serious situation. We need to then have more wherewithal to cope with that serious challenge. With a positive mindset, you become more spiritual. People who are Practically Aging are the lucky ones. They don\u2019t experience serious marks of aging. They won the lottery. And people in God\u2019s Waiting Room? In my travels, I\u2019ve seen God\u2019s Waiting Room. These are people who simply sit and wait for their name to be called to leave this life. They\u2019re bitter and show little energy or interest in the world around them. They\u2019re usually indifferent about their lives. When you go to a senior residential facility or a long-term care facility, you can spot someone in God\u2019s Waiting Room. Is positive aging the same as successful aging? I don\u2019t have a Ph.D. in gerontology; I have one in economics. So, I\u2019m learning the aging literature. And I what I found was missing in what I read about successful aging was spiritual health. If you\u2019re particularly positive about aging, it takes you to successful aging.Science and positive aging What does science tell us about positive aging? It\u2019s incredibly good for our health. I saw a 2019 study that said positive thinking can result in an 11% to 15% longer lifespan and can increase your likelihood of living to 85 or older. And Elizabeth Blackburn, who won the Nobel Prize [and was a 2017 Next Avenue Influencer in Aging] found that some behaviors of positive aging had the unintended effect of protecting and lengthening your telomeres, which act as an aging clock in every cell. It\u2019s difficult to make a blanket statement that if you practice positive aging you will live longer. But I think we can make a pretty strong statement by inserting the word \u2018may.\u2019 There is a likelihood your lifespan will be extended by practicing positive aging, due to healthy telomeres. We have 50,000 to 70,000 unconscious thoughts a day and 80% of them are negative. It takes practice to become positive. And what does positive aging have to do with ageism? The roadblocks to aging in America are ageism, the \u2018alone crisis\u2019 and attitudes about being \u2018forever young.\u2019 We live in a forever-young society that says you\u2019re swimming upstream against the current as you age. Young people are looked on as healthy and older people as stale and useless. And you tell people \u2018it\u2019s time to reclaim your life.\u2019 What do you mean? I have six building blocks for positive aging: Your inner spirit; mindfulness; positivity; the Four As [acceptance, adaptation, appreciation and attitude]; social support and balance. Reclaiming your life has to do with: \u2018All right, now that you\u2019ve learned what type of behavior you should be exhibiting and the lifestyles you should be living, let\u2019s look at the activities you can get involved with as a positive-aging mindset.\u2019 One of them is to write a bio legacy, your life story. It gets people to think long and hard about their life and what they did and how meaningful it was. It will give them a boost of energy to do more meaningful things in their senior years.Aging: \u2018A blessing and a curse\u2019 You call aging \u2018a blessing and a curse\u2019 and your subtitle is \u2018successfully coping with the inconveniences of aging.\u2019 What do you mean? Aging is a curse because we\u2019re physically and mentally declining and at limit, we\u2019ll be gone. It\u2019s finality. But it\u2019s a blessing because once you embrace the power of positive aging, you look at growing old as a journey of transition. While you are transitioning, the really neat part there is that aging becomes an inconvenience. You might like: I want year-round outdoor living \u2014 dry summers and no snow \u2014 on $4,000 a month. Where should I retire? On my journey since being diagnosed with cancer, I\u2019ve realized that every mark of aging we experience as humans are inconveniences. They change the quality of our life, but we\u2019re still living. Those who\u2019ve been through tough, life-threatening diseases know as long as life continues, it\u2019s great. Looking at aging as having inconveniences helps you get through any physical or mental challenge in front of you. You say positive aging saved your life. How? Mindfulness saved my life; living in the present moment. Before my diagnosis, I was on TV every week, I was riding high. I wrote a book, \u201cAre You Missing the Real Estate Boom?\u201d And that came out virtually the same week we announced the real estate bust at the National Association of Realtors. I wrote the book two years before it came out. So, I got creamed by the internet and rightly so. I had ended up buying seven properties, thinking the boom would continue for at least another year. It didn\u2019t. So, I got depressed and had a lot of anxiety. I didn\u2019t know what positive aging was at the time. I started to read Buddhism and learned about how to stay in the present moment. \u201cThe Power of Now\u201d by Eckhart Tolle was one of my favorite books. That\u2019s how I survived that crisis, and it\u2019s how I survived cancer. By living in the moment. Balancing, to me, is critical. I\u2019ve seen too many good people who were out of balance; it destroys them. When you\u2019re out of balance, you\u2019re stressed, you have anxiety, sometimes depression. A balanced life means you\u2019re more at peace. Read: Why early retirement IS all it\u2019s cracked up to be If you keep the same expectations as you had as a younger person, you will be way out of balance and very frustrated. You need to revise your expectations and live in a world of possibilities. Whenever I have an ailment, I am always saying: \u2018I am more than my physical body.\u2019 It just makes me feel better.The coronavirus and positive aging What does COVID-19 mean for positive aging? From a positive aging standpoint, it\u2019s about: How do you cope with the threat of getting COVID-19? The first thing you need to do is strengthen your ability to fight the virus, and that\u2019s your immune system. Eat the right foods, like squash and carrots and spinach and fruits and broccoli and salmon and dairy and nuts and eggs. Exercise is very big. Take 5,000 steps a day at a minimum; get to 10,000 if you can. Get enough sleep. That\u2019s very difficult for a lot of older people. The real key is to reduce anxiety and depression and calm your fears. If you\u2019ve never meditated before, just do five minutes in the morning and five minutes at night. A lot of us who do meditation have apps for that on our smartphones, like Headspace or Calm. They take you through the meditations to reduce anxiety. If people want to pray, that works as well. If you pray in groups, it\u2019s energizing. You\u2019ve started something called United We Age. What is that? It\u2019s very local right now, but with big ideas. Our initial goal is to provide social support to people around Port St. Lucie who have no social support. In long-term care facilities, about 50% of people have no family or friends. So, we\u2019ve created Friends for Seniors programs. We deliver to those facilities and we get wish lists from people there of what they want. Very simple items. Sometimes they want teddy bears or a big bag of candy or clothing. Also see: Why having a bucket list can be a big mistake We go shopping, and on their birthday, we come and spend time with them, so they feel like they\u2019re alive. On Christmas, we march in and give out presents. We\u2019re sort of playing Santa Claus. It\u2019s a very rewarding experience. We plan to expand to Vero Beach, about 25 miles away, and then continue to expand. People in other states have been asking if they could do something like it. We will try to set up franchises and let them run it.Money, work and positive aging I usually write and edit articles about personal finances and about work and careers. How do those topics play into positive aging? There\u2019s a great connection there. When you have a positive mindset, you relieve a lot of stress from your life so now you have the emotional wherewithal to take on what\u2019s out there in the business world or the financial world. And you\u2019re doing it with appreciation and with the right attitude. So, positive aging is good for your wealth and good for your health? Yes, I like the way you put that. Most definitely.
