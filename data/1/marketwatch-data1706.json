AFP via Getty Images Joe Biden on Wednesday gave a speech in Michigan about what his campaign described as \u201chis plan to ensure the future is Made in America by all of America\u2019s workers,\u201d as the Democratic presidential nominee continued an effort to counter President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d stance. Biden talked up his \u201cMade in America\u201d tax policy that his campaign had rolled out earlier in the day and which proposes a 21% minimum tax on all foreign earnings, noting features such as a new offshoring tax penalty and a 10% tax credit for companies making investments to create jobs for American workers. The Democratic challenger also promised executive actions in his first week as president that ensure the federal government isn\u2019t shirking on pledges to \u201cBuy American.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t buy for one second that the vitality of American manufacturing is a thing of the past,\u201d he said. Biden also said the Republican incumbent \u201chasn\u2019t stopped companies from closing plants and sending jobs overseas,\u201d but instead has \u201crewarded companies that have cut jobs and failed to invest here at home with billions in tax breaks.\u201d Opinion: The pandemic revealed the cracks in U.S. manufacturing \u2014 here\u2019s how to fix them Biden has addressed boosting domestic manufacturing before, such as by making a July proposal for a $700 billion \u201cBuy American\u201d campaign. As he spoke in Warren, Biden also blasted Trump in the wake of well-known journalist Bob Woodward\u2019s new book saying that the president knew the coronavirus was \u201cdeadly stuff\u201d but wanted to \u201cplay it down.\u201d The Democratic challenger said that was \u201ca life-and-death betrayal of the American people.\u201d The Trump campaign attacked Biden\u2019s latest moves before the Democratic challenger\u2019s speech. \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating to me that Joe Biden is suddenly trying to masquerade as an economic nationalist,\u201d Steve Cortes, a senior adviser for Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, told reporters during a conference call on Wednesday. \u201cWelcome to the party, but unfortunately you have no credibility, because you\u2019ve been acting in exactly the other direction for nearly a half century.\u201d The Trump team often has criticized Biden for his 1994 vote as a U.S. senator for the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta, which now has been replaced by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA. Trump is due to make his own visit on Thursday to Michigan, a key swing state, with a trip to Freeland. Meanwhile, a United Auto Workers branch in Flint, Mich., representing General Motors GM, -0.15% employees praised Biden ahead of his visit to their state, saying in a video that he \u201chad their backs\u201d amid the 2008 auto bailout. Unions for steelworkers and machinists also issued statements expressing support for Biden or criticizing Trump\u2019s record on aiding U.S. manufacturing. In a RealClearPolitics moving average of polls focused on top swing states that are likely to decide the election, Biden on Wednesday had an edge of 3.7 percentage points over Trump. Betting markets were giving the former vice president a 53.2% chance of winning vs. Trump\u2019s 45.8%. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% were recently trading higher on Wednesday, rebounding after a three-day selloff led by the tech sector."}]}
