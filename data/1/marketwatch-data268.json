A ghost kitchen is a cooking space that prepares food for delivery or to go. Ghost kitchens have grown more popular during COVID-19 as restaurant dining rooms have shuttered, customers have grown cautious about eating indoors, and online ordering has gained customers. Kroger KR, +0.46% is also an investor in ClusterTruck, though the grocery giant did not disclose all of the financial details of the partnership. Kroger and ClusterTruck piloted kitchens in Dec. 2019. See: Online grocery sales will skyrocket but margins take a hit, analysts say Each of the new kitchens will be about 1,000 square feet, and the menu will consist of about 80 meals that Kroger describes as \u201cquality you can get at a sit-down restaurant with the personality of street food.\u201d Kroger says the expanded partnership comes after the grocer experienced a 127% rise in digital sales during the second quarter. ClusterTruck\u2019s delivery process is aided by technology to ensure that meals are delivered to the customer within seven minutes of preparation and within 30 minutes of ordering. Orders are placed through the ClusterTruck app or on that company\u2019s website and can be delivered to a customer\u2019s home or picked up at a participating Kroger store. Menus will be branded with the ClusterTruck name, though Kroger will provide some in-store promotion. \u201cAs part of the Restock Kroger initiative launched in 2018, Kroger has prioritized offering new prepared fresh food options and developing new ways for customers to engage via e-commerce,\u201d a Kroger spokesperson told MarketWatch.

In addition to ghost kitchens, restaurant chains are also launching virtual brands, which offer specialized menus that capitalize on the kitchen space and marketing abilities of existing companies. Chili\u2019s parent Brinker International Inc. EAT, +1.00% launched its virtual chicken chain It\u2019s Just Wings during the final weeks of its fiscal 2020 year. By the time Brinker announced its earnings in August, the company said It\u2019s Just Wings had the potential to be a $150 million brand in its first year. \u201c[W]e had to buy a couple of small refrigerators in a couple of restaurants, but for the sales volume that it generates, it\u2019s really capital-free,\u201d Brinker Chief Executive Wyman Roberts said on the earnings call, according to FactSet. On the flip side, Eugene Lee, chief executive of Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants Inc. DRI, -1.34%, said on his company\u2019s fiscal first-quarter earnings call last month that virtual brands are \u201cnot the right approach\u201d for them. \u201cWe want to focus on brands that we have got 20-plus year and hundreds of millions of dollars invested in trying to build and we want to make sure that they are executing at a high level,\u201d he said, according to FactSet. Monica Challingsworth, head of global relationships at Synergy Restaurant Consultants, agrees that ghost kitchens and virtual brands might not be for every company. She has worked with Darden. With businesses impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, there must be considerations made for execution, marketing and other factors. A large company with many brands, like Darden, would likely have problems making a virtual brand strategy work. Don\u2019t miss: Amazon Prime Day could generate nearly $10 billion in sales, experts forecast \u201cThey take so much pride in being consistent, testing items, implementing it,\u201d Challingsworth said. \u201cIt would take so long and you don\u2019t know that it will be successful.\u201d Virtual brands and ghost kitchens were on the rise pre-COVID, but Challingsworth expects that many will go under once the pandemic is over. \u201cWe were oversaturated with restaurants,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone switching and jumping to these ghost kitchens and virtual brands, some will fail.\u201d On Sept. 16, KeyBanc Capital Markets raised the price target for Darden Restaurants to $102 from $87 while maintaining its overweight stock rating. \u201cOlive Garden\u2019s sales recovery has lagged that of several big casual dining brands with the absence of third-party delivery partnerships and/or virtual concepts, limited outdoor seating (no tents in parking lots), and a more nuanced floor plan that limits capacity under social distancing restrictions,\u201d wrote analysts led by Eric Gonzalez. \u201cThat said, we believe these issues are transitory. Wait times remain elevated at peak times despite limited advertising investment, no new innovation, and a pause in the promotional schedule. This suggests an opportunity exists for Olive Garden to drive demand at the appropriate time.\u201d In a conversation after that note was published, Gonzalez pointed out the differences between Brinker restaurants, which also includes Chili\u2019s and Maggiano\u2019s brands. \u201cThe real differentiator is capacity,\u201d he said. \u201cThe average Chili\u2019s is more in rural, suburban areas whereas Olive Garden has two locations in Manhattan. Chili\u2019s traffic is down, comping slightly negative and traffic is generally negative, so there\u2019s plenty of capacity without disrupting business.\u201d Moreover, Olive Garden isn\u2019t set up digitally to easily launch a virtual brand, he said. Still, the barrier to entry for these ghost kitchens and virtual brands is low, Gonzalez said. And: Halloween sales forecast could be frightful to companies trying to create holiday season momentum COVID-19 has accelerated the move to digital ordering and ghost kitchens, Gonzalez said, in much the same way that the pandemic accelerated the shift to e-commerce that is happening in retail. The model isn\u2019t perfect, and there are many diners who miss eating out. But Gonzalez estimates that there were hundreds of thousands of restaurants operating in the U.S. before the pandemic, more than there should have been. \u201cThere will always be an element of service and people looking for a dine-in experience,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know that we need 600,000 or 700,000 restaurants in this country.\u201d Kroger sees a demand for its ghost kitchens, and the results from the first two locations will determine whether it will expand further. \u201cThe new on-premise kitchen, in partnership with ClusterTruck, is an innovation that streamlines ordering, preparation and delivery, supporting Kroger as we meet the sustained customer demand for quick, fresh restaurant-quality meals, especially as we navigate an unprecedented health crisis that has affected every aspect of our lives, including mealtime,\u201d said Dan De La Rosa, Kroger\u2019s group vice president of fresh merchandising, in a statement. Kroger stock has rallied 17.4% for the year to date while the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% is up 5.8% for the period."}]}
