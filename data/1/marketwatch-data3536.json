Why didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Trump help my state with coronavirus testing?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland In an essay published in the Washington Post that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s excerpted from a forthcoming book, Gov. Larry Hogan describes how he turned to his South Korean wife, Yumi, for help in procuring vital test kits from her home country by asking President Moon Jae-in to connect Maryland with LabGenomics, a medical testing company. Seoul sent Maryland a half-million tests at a cost of $9 million. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was a bargain considering the $2.8 billion in revenue we projected the pandemic would cost Maryland,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hogan wrote. See: Hunt for medical supplies creates marketplace of desperation Even then, Maryland had to take extra precautions to secure the tests by driving them to a warehouse at an undisclosed location. That was after the federal government seized 3 million N95 masks purchased by Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, like Hogan a Republican governor of a typically \u00e2\u0080\u009cblue\u00e2\u0080\u009d state. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to let Washington stop us from helping Marylanders,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hogan. The test-kit purchase was necessary after Hogan and other governors watched Trump consistently play down the threat of the virus, failing to \u00e2\u0080\u009cissue public warnings, draw up a 50-state strategy, or dispatch medical gear or lifesaving ventilators from the national stockpile to American hospitals.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cEventually, it was clear that waiting around for the president to run the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s response was hopeless; if we delayed any longer, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be condemning more of our citizens to suffering and death,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote. Hogan recounted how Trump responded to news of the first U.S. case of COVID-19 while at Davos in January, immediately insisting during a friendly CNBC interview that it was \u00e2\u0080\u009ctotally under control.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The U.S. now has 3.49 million confirmed cases, and 137,420 people have died, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo many nationwide actions could have been taken in those early days but weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. While other countries were racing ahead with well-coordinated testing regimes, the Trump administration bungled the effort,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hogan wrote. The first CDC test was faulty, and burdensome regulations delayed private U.S. labs from coming up with accurate tests. As Trump tweeted and told reporters that \u00e2\u0080\u009canyone can have a test,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the reality on the ground was far different. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe resulting disorganization would delay mass testing for almost two months and leave the nation largely in the dark as the epidemic spread,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hogan wrote.

There were dire forecasts, he noted: that the outbreak would become a catastrophe, that the death toll could be significant, that the coronavirus was much more contagious than SARS. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have to follow the science \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where the answers lie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the governor wrote.

Other criticisms of Trump in the essay include his falsely blaming the Obama administration for the CDC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s faulty tests and his bragging that the U.S. was testing more than anybody in the world. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis was true in absolute numbers, since we are a much bigger country, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d tested far fewer per capita than the Koreans had \u00e2\u0080\u0094 1,048 tests per million people vs. South Korea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 6,764 per million \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and of course that was the only figure that mattered,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hogan.
