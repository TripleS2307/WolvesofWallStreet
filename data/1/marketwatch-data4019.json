Using more complete source data, the government found that consumer spending was weaker than previously estimated. This was offset by upward revisions to business fixed investment. The data for the first was dragged down by the impact from the coronavirus pandemic that hit hard at the end of the period. Federal Reserve officials and private-sector economists have forecast an unprecedented contraction in GDP in the April-June quarter. Economists surveyed by MarketWatch expect a decline at a 29.5% annual rate. The data will be released on July 30."}]}
