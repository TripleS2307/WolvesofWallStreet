FB, +0.26% board member and Donald Trump supporter Peter Thiel, made its filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission public Tuesday. The document begins with a letter from Chief Executive Alexander Karp that defends Palantir\u2019s work with governments and militaries around the world and declares its differences with Silicon Valley, which the company has left for Denver. \u201cOur company was founded in Silicon Valley,\u201d Karp wrote. \u201cBut we seem to share fewer and fewer of the technology sector\u2019s values and commitments.\u201d Read:Palantir plans to go public as it moves away from reliance on government work CEO letters are rather common in filings for initial public offerings and direct listings, but Palantir took the approach one step further by making Karp\u2019s letter the first section of its filing. Karp\u2019s letter called out advertising-based business models such as Facebook and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOGL, +1.82% GOOG, +1.97% Google for their data practices while defending Palantir\u2019s use of data for surveillance and other purposes. \u201cFrom the start, we have repeatedly turned down opportunities to sell, collect, or mine data. Other technology companies, including some of the largest in the world, have built their entire businesses on doing just that,\u201d Karp wrote. \u201cSoftware projects with our nation\u2019s defense and intelligence agencies, whose missions are to keep us safe, have become controversial, while companies built on advertising dollars are commonplace. For many consumer internet companies, our thoughts and inclinations, behaviors and browsing habits, are the product for sale. The slogans and marketing of many of the Valley\u2019s largest technology firms attempt to obscure this simple fact.\u201d Palantir has faced acrimony and anger far beyond Silicon Valley for its secretive work with powerful entities. The company has contracts with the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, including for software used to track migrants at the border. Because of that, it has been targeted by protesters and activists including Mijente, an immigration advocacy group. \u201cThis is not just a question of one pocket of the country, the protests are happening nationwide,\u201d said Jacinta Gonzalez, senior campaign director at Mijente, adding that advocacy groups in Colorado had already contacted her about Palantir. \u201cPalantir is complicit in the surveillance, arrest and deportation of our communities through their work with ICE,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cTheir S-1 recognizes that these are risky contracts to take on. We\u2019re calling on investors everywhere not to invest when the IPO happens.\u201d See also: The CEO who made one of Silicon Valley\u2019s worst acquisitions wants a $400 million blank check Employees at large tech companies including Google, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +3.01% , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +2.48% and Salesforce.com Inc. CRM, +2.21% have protested some of their companies\u2019 contracts with the federal government, including ICE. But Karp said that Palantir employees \u201cembrace the complexity\u201d of federal work that includes surveilling enemies and developing war plans. \u201cThe construction of software platforms that enable more effective surveillance by the state of its adversaries or that assist soldiers in executing attacks raises countless issues, involving the points of tension and tradeoffs between our collective security and individual privacy, the power of machines, and the types of lives we both want to and should lead,\u201d Karp wrote. \u201cThe ethical challenges that arise are constant and unrelenting. We embrace the complexity that comes from working in areas where the stakes are often very high and the choices may be imperfect.\u201d Chris Hoofnagle, the faculty director for UC Berkeley\u2019s Center for Law & Technology and who sits on the Palantir Council on Privacy and Civil Liberties, said Tuesday that he is \u201cperplexed\u201d by tech companies\u2019 resistance to work with the federal government, which contributed to the rise of Silicon Valley before the boom in venture-capital investors. He chalked it up to \u201creaction formation or some other juvenile confusion.\u201d \u201cSilicon Valley wouldn\u2019t even exist without the Department of Defense,\u201d Hoofnagle said. \u201cMost of the technologies developed here are dual-use and cannot be created without contributing to military strength.\u201d Irina Raicu, the director of internet ethics at Santa Clara University\u2019s Markkula Center for Applied Ethics, told MarketWatch on Tuesday that Karp\u2019s letter \u201cincludes some very old (and repeatedly debunked) Silicon Valley tropes,\u201d and pushed back against three specific points the CEO made. \u201cFor example, that \u2018[t]he bargain between the public and the technology sector has for the most part been consensual, in that the value of the products and services available seemed to outweigh the invasions of privacy that enabled their rise,\u2019\u201d Raicu wrote in an email, quoting Karp\u2019s letter. \u201cIt has become very clear, over the past several years, that the public had no understanding of the privacy-invasive practices behind many of the services it was offered; had assumed that laws were in place to prevent such practices; and has been pushing for new laws to prevent them.\u201d Read: Facebook and Twitter are worried about the day after Election Day In response to Karp\u2019s claim that Americans will not \u201cremain tolerant of the idiosyncrasies and excesses of the Valley,\u201d Raicu said that Americans have not been tolerant of the Valley\u2019s actions for years, adding \u201cSurely Palantir has crunched enough data to be aware of that.\u201d As to Karp\u2019s statement that Palantir has \u201cchosen sides\u201d between Silicon Valley and the government, Raicu said Palantir\u2019s \u201cclients in law enforcement and intelligence agencies do not represent a different \u2018side\u2019 from the American public.\u201d"}]}
