A basket of equities that have been eagerly bought by individual investors since the depths of the coronavirus-induced selloff on March 23 has returned 61%, compared with returns of 45% for a portfolio of investments owned by mutual funds and hedge funds, according to Goldman Sachs data, including prominent analyst David Kostin. The Wall Street pros, who have consistently lagged behind the overall market since the last crisis in 12 years ago, now may find themselves lagging behind mom-and-pop investors by a whopping 16 percentage points, according to the bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s research. The Goldman analysts report that much of the outperformance by individual investors occurred in the middle of May, as upbeat data on declines in the spread of the deadly pandemic and less-bad economic reports encouraged bargain hunting in cyclicals, including small-capitalization stocks, and shares of companies that are economically sensitive and would therefore benefit from signs of improvement in the business climate.
