But if tensions between China and the U.S. escalate, and the U.S. sees a sharp daily increases in COVID-19 cases, \u201cthen gold and silver will only rise.\u201d He believes that price corrections, if any, will be \u201cmild.\u201d The $2,000 mark for gold will be \u201cvery easily broken.\u201d August gold GC00, +2.17% US:GCQ20 rose $7.50, or 0.4%, to settle at $1,897.50 an ounce on Comex Friday, after trading as high as $1,904.60. For the week, prices rose 4.8%, the biggest weekly percentage climb since the week ended April 9. The contract topped the most-active contract settlement record of $1,891.90 from August 22, 2011, based on records going back to November 1984, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The record most-active intraday level still stands at $1,923.70 an ounce from Sept. 6, 2011. The front-month July gold contract US:GCN20, which trades on significantly lower volume, notched a record for a second session in a row. It settled at $1,897.30 Friday, up $8.20, or 0.4%, for the session. That\u2019s a record for the front-month contracts, based on data going back to 1975. Read: Gold scores a record close as U.S.-China tensions mount \u201cThere are lots of push-and-pull factors in the backdrop\u201d of gold\u2019s rally, said Barani Krishnan, senior commodities analyst at Investing.com. \u201cYou have stimulus expectations worldwide after the [European Union] $750 billion coronavirus relief plan, even as Congress goes back and forth on its own CARES 4.0 package for Covid-19 that should bring another $1 trillion into the mix.\u201d The U.S. dollar also continues to \u201cbreak down, pushing precious metals higher, though simmering U.S.-Chinese tensions are supporting the greenback from a complete meltdown,\u201d he said in emailed commentary. Silver prices, meanwhile, also recently rallied to their highest settlement since 2013, with the September silver US:SIU20 contract on Wednesday settling at $23.144 an ounce. It ended Friday at $22.85, up 15.6% for the week. \u201cOrdinarily this is the quiet time for gold\u2014summer doldrums,\u201d said Ross Norman, chief executive officer of precious metals news and information provider Metals Daily. \u201cWell, not this year.\u201d In a forecast issued to the London Bullion Market Association in December 2019, he had forecast that gold prices would achieve an all-time high this year. Given that, he said there\u2019s \u201cno surprise it has achieved it.\u201d The move has \u201cjust been quicker than we had expected.\u201d Read:Why gold has become a \u2018weapon of choice\u2019 for investors \u201cIn reality, virtually everything is going gold\u2019s way\u2014record debt, epic increase in money supply, silver catching up, negative real yields, and even a dollar correction,\u201d Norman told MarketWatch. George Gero, managing director at RBC Wealth Management, told MarketWatch that gold\u2019s upward momentum is \u201ccaused by perfect storm of pandemic headlines, benign dollars and interest rates, as global economic stimulus grows.\u201d \u201cThis may last longer than usual cycles\u201d as the pandemic casts a shadow on Europe, South America, the Far East, as well as the U.S., he said. Contributing to gold\u2019s haven appeal are escalating tensions between China and the U.S., the upcoming U.S. election, worries about an increase in debts from continuing stimulus, and unrest everywhere, said Gero. Gold prices have climbed by around 50% since the summer of 2018, when the metal bottomed under $1,200 an ounce, said Adrian Ash, director of research at BullionVault. That\u2019s the fastest two-year gain since New Year 2012, he said. The yellow metal also has climbed around $400 an ounce from March\u2019s COVID-19 crash, \u201cits steepest 17-week gain since the very tops of September 2011 and before that January 1980,\u201d said Ash, adding that trading volumes on BullionVault, an online platform for physical precious metals, reached $28.9 million, which was the third busiest day ever, after March 17 when the COVID crisis really broke, and June 24, 2016, the day of the U.K.\u2019s Brexit referendum result. \u201cHot money\u2019s finally joined in,\u201d said Ash. That said, analysts warned that gold could soon see a correction. Prices could move lower \u201con profit taking,\u201d said Norman. At the same time, the stock market is \u201clooking disconnected from the real economy and a sell off could see margin calls again like we saw\u201d in the first quarter, prompting traders to sell gold to cover those margins. Gero voiced caution as well. \u201cNext week, options expirations on Comex, with in-the-money options becoming futures contracts needing cash margin, could bring traders profit taking\u201d in gold, he said. Even if there was a pullback in gold prices, however, Norman said \u201call that would do is provide a fresh buying opportunity\u2026so that window could close quite quickly.\u201d"}]}
