The CEOs of Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, +1.82% \u00c2 , GOOG, +1.97% \u00c2 , Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +3.01% \u00c2 , Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.74% \u00c2 , and Facebook Inc. FB, +0.26% \u00c2 endured more than five hours of grueling questions about competition Wednesday from House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee members in a series of sharp exchanges.

Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said in a particularly contentious exchange with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis should not have been allowed to happen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Zuckerberg, who has testified a handful of times before Congress the past few years, said he viewed Instagram \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a photo-sharing app for mobile devices acquired for $1 billion in 2012 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as a competitor and complement to Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business. He deemed the purchase \u00e2\u0080\u009cwildly successful\u00e2\u0080\u009d after Facebook invested heavily into its operations. In another clash, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos was hesitant to deny Amazon uses data from its third-party sellers to build its products. The charge, outlined in a Wall Street Journal story, could be the focus of an Amazon investigation, paralleling similar complaints that Apple develops its own apps based on data it receives within App Store about the apps of independent developers. Later, Rep. Mary Gay Scanlan, D-Pa., invoked the story of Diapers.com, a competitor that Amazon engaged in a price war before buying its parent company, Quidsi Inc., for $545 million in 2011. The company was shut down in March 2017. Bezos, who was testifying before Congress for the first time, acknowledged it was hard to recall details of the long-ago episode. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai was repeatedly grilled for allegedly stealing content from developers, such as restaurant reviews from Yelp Inc. YELP, -1.66% \u00c2 (When Yelp complained, Google threatened to delist Yelp.) It also was accused of skewing search queries that showed the most profitable results for Google rather than the most popular. Pichai declined both charges. Luther Lowe, senior vice president of public policy at Yelp, said he was \u00e2\u0080\u009cpleasantly surprised\u00e2\u0080\u009d to see the issue addressed after Yelp had \u00e2\u0080\u009cadvocated for a decade\u00e2\u0080\u009d on the issue. There were no immediate \u00e2\u0080\u009caha!\u00e2\u0080\u009d moments nor smoking guns, but clearly uncomfortable exchanges. Facebook and acquisitions from a more than yearlong investigation covering some 1.3 million documents. Strong undercurrents of political grandstanding emerged, as when several Republican members charged Facebook, Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s YouTube, and Twitter with censoring the views of conservative voices on their platforms \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as well as accusing Google of untoward interactions with the Department of Defense and Chinese authorities. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a mix of antitrust ambush and political grandstanding and, as Mary Gay Scanlon put it, diversions into conspiracy theories,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bhaskar Chakravorti, dean of global business at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, told MarketWatch in an email. What patterns emerged from the hearing were charges of misconduct across various categories including stifling competition, exerting market power, and questionable use of data, NYU business professor Vasant Dhar told MarketWatch. Another theme was the risk companies face when employees engaged in questionable practices to misuse seller data (as in the case of Amazon) or influence company policy to bias algorithms (Google). The confrontational tone was set early, in the opening statement of Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., chairman of the subcommittee. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMany of the practices used by these companies have harmful economic effects. They discourage entrepreneurship, destroy jobs, hike costs, and degrade quality,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSimply put: They have too much power. This power staves off new forms of competition, creativity, and innovation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd while these dominant firms may still produce some new innovative products, their dominance is killing the small businesses, manufacturing, and overall dynamism that are the engines of the American economy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cicilline said. Befitting its historic nature and what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at stake, the hearing was scheduled to start at high noon ET, but was delayed an hour because an unrelated hearing ran late. The virtual clashes capped more than a year of hearings and investigations by Congress into the business practices of the Big Four and whether they violate antitrust laws. The committee and its staff accumulated 1.3 million documents; its conclusions, following today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hearing, are expected to be issued in a report later this year.

The companies are also the subject of investigations by European regulators, who have shown more of a willingness to fine them. The companies boast sizable market share an influence in e-commerce (Amazon, Google), streaming (Amazon, Apple), advertising (Google, Facebook, Amazon), search (Google), social media (Facebook and its properties Instagram and WhatsApp), cloud computing (Amazon, Google), and fledgling areas such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour platform is so big, you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t contain false and harmful content,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cicilline told Zuckerberg at one point, driving home the immensity of its digital properties. Google, which is being investigated by the Justice Department and state attorneys general for its ad business, is likely to face the first action from the federal government. During an exchange in Wednesday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hearing, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., asserted that Google controls both the buy and sell side of the ad market. Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +2.48% \u00c2 , which does not play big in consumer markets, is not part of the investigations though Slack Technologies Inc. WORK, +3.36% \u00c2 last week filed an anticompetitive claim against the software giant with the European Commission. An attempt by Republicans to add Twitter Inc. TWTR, -0.23% \u00c2 to Wednesday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hearing was unheeded by Democrats, who control the House. The tentacles of power of the four companies questioned have affected thousands of smaller companies and businesses that compete in some manner. Their combined market value of about $5 trillion continued to rise Wednesday. Shares of all four were up at least 1% on Wednesday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe want to see fairness at the end of the day,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ben Volach, co-founder and co-CEO of Blix, an email app developer that claims it has data showing Apple suppressed App Store rankings of products that compete with Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own apps. Blix, which sued Apple in October alleging patent infringement and antitrust violations, worked with Cicilline\u00e2\u0080\u0099s staff to come up with questions for Cook. \u00e2\u0080\u009cApple not only creates the devices and the OS, but the main operations on the phone, and they extend this into even more areas,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Volach told MarketWatch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA handful of technology platform giants have come to exert far too much power over consumer commerce and communications,\u00e2\u0080\u009d George Slover, senior policy counsel at Consumer Reports, said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis extreme level of market concentration harms consumers, depriving people of competitive choices, fair and transparent prices, and a meaningful diversity of views.\u00e2\u0080\u009d All four tech CEOs opened with statements that ranged from the personal (Bezos) and prowess of and popularity of products (Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Tim Cook) to an eight-part opus that read like a grade-school essay (Zuckerberg) and personal success stories of customers (Pichai).

So far, their stocks have flourished during COVID-19 with Amazon a particular beneficiary. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives cautioned in a note Wednesday that \u00e2\u0080\u009canti-trust storm clouds appear to be building in the Beltway against Big Tech looking ahead into the rest of 2020.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cUltimately, we think a legislative fix is the only one that creates a potential for limitations on these companies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ability to conduct business, whether that takes the form of higher taxes or new rules regarding market concentration,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ives wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAbsent a legislative fix, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see meaningful change in regulation, although future acquisitions will most certainly be scrutinized and more difficult to close (see Alphabet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed acquisition of FitBit FIT, -0.14% \u00c2 , still unsettled after 9 months).\u00e2\u0080\u009d See also: Big Tech\u00e2\u0080\u0099s big test arrives in the busiest week of earnings season"}]}
