The vote by the City Council came at an extraordinary moment when the nation\u2019s biggest city is grappling with a $9 billion revenue loss due to the coronavirus pandemic and simultaneously with pressure to cut back on policing and invest more in community and social programs. Protesters have been camped outside City Hall, insisting that the city slash $1 billion from the New York Police Department\u2019s budget amid a nationwide campaign to \u201cdefund\u201d police \u2014 a movement animated by outrage over the deaths of George Floyd and other Black Americans at the hands of police. Critics of the deal said the billion dollar cut wasn\u2019t a billion dollar cut at all. Some of the funding reduction, they noted, was merely shifting police functions like school safety to the Department of Education. And they doubted the promised reduction in overtime would ever happen. Mayor Bill de Blasio supports the $88.2 billion spending plan. Council Speaker Corey Johnson said when the budget deal was announced Tuesday that it wasn\u2019t what he had hoped for, and lamented he hadn\u2019t been unable to negotiate a bigger police budget cut. \u201cI am disappointed,\u201d Johnson said at a news conference. \u201cI did my best.\u201d The proposal did little to assuage the demonstrators. Many said they intended to stay outside City Hall indefinitely. \u201cWe are being gaslit,\u201d said activist Jawanza James Williams. \u201cThis movement is about so much more than the $1 billion, and this means they don\u2019t understand what we\u2019re saying.\u201d Activists say the budget needs to make a substantial, not symbolic, difference in advancing racial justice and curbing the size and power of the nation\u2019s largest police force. Five years ago, the City Council \u2014 then as now, overwhelmingly Democratic \u2014 added nearly 1,300 additional officers to the NYPD. Now, Johnson has said he was wrong to support the expansion. Council budget leaders said they needed to balance calls to cut policing with residents\u2019 concerns about safety. \u201cMany in my community have supported police and want police. They just want families and young people to be treated fairly,\u201d said Councilwoman Vanessa Gibson, who represents a Bronx district where over half of residents are Hispanic and about 40% are Black. Gibson said she\u2019d met Tuesday with relatives of a Bronx 17-year-old who was shot and killed Sunday, days after his high school graduation. \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to misunderstand and think that we don\u2019t care and that we have not been working our behinds off to get to a place of equity,\u201d while ensuring communities \u201care not left behind with crime, violence, illegal guns in our communities, no programs, no activities, and no hope for a better tomorrow,\u201d Gibson said. But some other members said the budget proposal didn\u2019t dig deep enough into police spending. Councilman Brad Lander, who voted no, called it \u201cmore budget-dancing than meaningful reductions.\u201d Cuts would come from canceling a nearly 1,200-person police recruiting class set for next month \u2014 though another class in October is scheduled to go forward \u2014 as well as halving overtime spending, redeploying officers from administrative functions to patrol and ending police responsibility for school crossing guards and homeless outreach. The police department also would give up control over public school security, which the NYPD took over from the Department of Education in 1998. The city has about 5,300 civilian school safety agents. De Blasio said details were being worked out, but the Education Department would train the agents. Money would go instead to education, social services in communities hit hard by the virus, and summer youth programs for over 100,000 people. Other cuts are being made to the NYPD\u2019s capital budget, including cancelling plans to build a new police precinct in Queens and instead using the money to build a community center. \u201cWe all understand that we have to answer the concerns of this moment, that people want to see our society progress,\u201d de Blasio, a Democrat, said at a news conference. He vowed the changes would not compromise public safety. Police officials didn\u2019t comment Tuesday. Commissioner Dermot Shea has said he was open to giving up school safety and other cuts, as long as the amount of officers on patrol doesn\u2019t shrink. The NYPD budget is now around $6 billion, plus several billion dollars more in shared city expenses such as pensions. The new plan calls for an ambitious, nearly $300 million cut in police overtime. The department paid out $115 million in overtime just during recent protests over Floyd\u2019s May 25 death in Minneapolis. The city budget totaled nearly $93 billion when passed last June. Before the virus hit, de Blasio proposed a more than $95 billion spending plan for the budget year that starts Wednesday."}]}
