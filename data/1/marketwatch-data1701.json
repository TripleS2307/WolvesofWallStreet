Congressional lawmakers planned to introduce a bill Friday that would see the U.S. government funded through mid-December but U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday the airlines and restaurant industries both need help that could be in another big economic stimulus package. House Democrats had passed a $3.5 trillion relief bill in May, but more recently in negotiations with White House officials said they would accept a $2.2 trillion deal, the Wall Street Journal reported.

On the geopolitical front, the U.S. Commerce Department said Friday it is prohibiting transactions involving Tencent\u2019s WeChat and Bytedance\u2019s TikTok.

The challenge for investors, Stritch noted, is the near term. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need some political clarity, and we have to get some vaccine clarity. There are a lot of assumptions out there right now and until some of those are confirmed or refuted, we will probably continue to see choppiness.\u201d For now, Stritch\u2019s team is favoring what he calls \u201cquality growth\u201d stocks. \u201cI don\u2019t want to embrace a cyclical value story just yet,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI would pay up for certainty rather than make a big bet on timing the economic recovery.\u201d Read: Coronavirus tally: Global cases of COVID-19 top 30 million, 946,490 deaths and U.S. death toll close to 200,000 Meanwhile, the Fed is embarking on a second round of stress tests for the banking sector amid the coronavirus epidemic and is reportedly considering extending limits to dividend payments and share buybacks on the industry.
