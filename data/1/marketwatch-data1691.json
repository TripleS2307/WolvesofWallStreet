That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the message Trump conveyed on Wednesday in response to a reporter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s question regarding whether he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d commit to a peaceful transfer of power. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to have to see what happens,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been complaining very strongly about the ballots, and the ballots are a disaster.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have a very peaceful \u00e2\u0080\u0094 there won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be a transfer frankly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be a continuation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany\u00c2 said Thursday that Trump \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill accept the results of a free and fair election.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own refusal to commit to a peaceful transfer of power has ignited rage across the political spectrum. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe winner of the November 3rd election will be inaugurated on January 20th,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., tweeted on Thursday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere will be an orderly transition just as there has been every four years since 1792.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sen. Mitt Romney, a Republican from Utah and former presidential nominee in 2008, said that peaceful transition of power is \u00e2\u0080\u009cfundamental to democracy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWithout that, there is Belarus,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Romney added referring to the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s newly sworn-in president, Alexander Lukashenko. The European Union does not recognize him as the legitimate president of the country after he held a secretive ceremony earlier this week. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAny suggestion that a president might not respect this Constitutional guarantee is both unthinkable and unacceptable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Romney said in his tweet posted on Wednesday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m absolutely confident there will be a peaceful transition if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a new president or, if not, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have a continuation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Romney told reporters on Thursday. Sen. Bernie Sanders, an Independent from Vermont who dropped out of the presidential race in April, labeled Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments as \u00e2\u0080\u009cauthoritarian.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added that they are \u00e2\u0080\u009cdangerous\u00e2\u0080\u009d to our democracy and \u00e2\u0080\u009csomething that in my wildest dreams I never thought I would be discussing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not in the habit of quoting former President Ronald Reagan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sanders said at an event in Washington, D.C., on Thursday. He went on to read an excerpt from the January 1981 inaugural speech Reagan made: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe orderly transfer of authority as called for in the Constitution\u00c2 routinely takes place as it has for almost two centuries and few of us stop to think how unique we really are. In the eyes of many in the world, this every 4-year ceremony we accept as normal is nothing less than a miracle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cToo many people have fought and died to defend American democracy, and you [Trump] are not going to destroy it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sanders said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe American people will not allow that to happen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi agreed with Romney that a peaceful transition\u00c2 would occur, but said it was sad the question even had to be asked, blaming Trump. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI remind him \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2 you are not in North Korea, you are not in Turkey, you are not in Russia, Mr. President,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are in the United States of America. It is a democracy. So why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you try for a moment to honor your oath of office to the Constitution?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Democratic challenger Joe Biden responded to his comments on Wednesday asking, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat country are we in?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook, he says the most irrational things. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what to say,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Biden added."}]}
