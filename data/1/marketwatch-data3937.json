Tesla TSLA, +1.89% \u00c2 reports quarterly deliveries, which are its proxy for sales, and production numbers within a few days of the end of a quarter. The Tesla factory in Fremont, Calif., was closed roughly half the quarter under regional shutdown orders designed to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Analysts polled by FactSet consensus expect deliveries of 72,000 vehicles, of which 61,000 would be Model 3 mass-market sedans and the remainder roughly split between sales of the Model S luxury sedan and the Model X SUV. Those are heightened expectations from last week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. Tesla shares surged more than 7% on Tuesday and are poised for another all-time closing record. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss:Elon Musk vs. Bay Area officials: These emails show what happened behind the scenes in the Tesla factory fight Investors are hoping that Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Shanghai factory, which came on line earlier this year, picked up some of the slack. Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inventory from the first quarter also could help with sales in the April-June period. Wall Street also would welcome sales numbers for the Model Y, the compact SUV that is Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s newest vehicle in the lineup. Tesla has not exactly backed off its goal to sell more than 500,000 vehicles this year, but it has changed its tune somewhat, telling investors in late April it had the \u00e2\u0080\u009ccapacity installed\u00e2\u0080\u009d to deliver more than half a million vehicles in 2020 \u00e2\u0080\u009cdespite announced production interruptions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The electric-car maker said in early April it delivered 88,400 vehicles in the first quarter, a performance the company called its \u00e2\u0080\u009cbest ever\u00e2\u0080\u009d first quarter and a number only a tad below Wall Street expectations. Analysts at Evercore ISI pegged their second-quarter sales expectations at between 80,000 and 84,000 units, with sales in China offsetting a predicted sales decline in North America and a \u00e2\u0080\u009csteep decline\u00e2\u0080\u009d in sales in Europe. Tesla had between 14,000 and 20,000 vehicles in inventory from the first quarter, the Evercore ISI analysts said.

Tesla reopened the Fremont factory amid a standoff with local health authorities that included Chief Executive Elon Musk calling the shutdown \u00e2\u0080\u009cfascist\u00e2\u0080\u009d and suing the county where the factory is located. The lawsuit was eventually dropped. Shares of Tesla have gained 131% this year, and recently cracked $1,000. The gains contrast with losses of 6% and 12% for the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% \u00c2 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% \u00c2 , respectively."}]}
