In the third quarter, the Treasury now expects to borrow $947 billion in net marketable debt. That is $270 billion higher than estimated in May. The department assumes a cash balance of $800 billion. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, Treasury said it expects to borrow $1.2 trillion in net marketable debt with a cash balance maintained at $800 billion. In a statement, Treasury said its new borrowing estimates for the third and fourth quarters \u201cassume $1 trillion of additional borrowing need in anticipation of additional legislation being passed in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.\u201d Talks of another package remained deadlocked on Capitol Hill. Treasury borrowed $2.75 trillion in net marketable debt in the second quarter and ended with a cash balance of $1.72 trillion. This was lower than the Treasury\u2019s prior $3 trillion estimate, which included a cash balance of $800 billion. Analysts say the rush of new issuance is unlikely to dent appetite for government bonds this year, as the Federal Reserve\u2019s bond-buying and pledge to keep policy easy have kept bond yields pinned down near their record lows. The 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.777% was up 2.6 basis points to 0.562% on Monday. Bond prices move inversely to yields. Additional financing details related to the Treasury\u2019s quarterly refunding will be released at 8:30 a.m. Eastern on Wednesday."}]}
