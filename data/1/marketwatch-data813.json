Hopes are high that answers about at least one of several candidates being tested in the U.S. could come by year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s end. \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098President Trump is still trying to sabotage the work of our scientists and public health experts for his own political ends.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Sen. Patty Murray \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe feel cautiously optimistic that we will be able to have a safe and effective vaccine, although there is never a guarantee of that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Anthony Fauci, infectious-diseases chief at the National Institutes of Health, told a Senate committee. See:Just 4 in 10 Americans now say they would get the first coronavirus vaccine \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and most don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect to pay out of pocket President Donald Trump is pushing for a faster timeline, which many experts say is risky and may not allow for adequate testing. On Wednesday he tweeted a link to news about the new Johnson & Johnson vaccine study and said the Food and Drug Administration \u00e2\u0080\u009cmust move quickly!\u00e2\u0080\u009d See:Trump suggests he wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t permit FDA to tighten standards for an emergency-use authorization of a coronavirus vaccine \u00e2\u0080\u009cPresident Trump is still trying to sabotage the work of our scientists and public health experts for his own political ends,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington state, said before ticking off examples of pressure on the FDA. FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn pledged that career scientists, not politicians, will decide whether any coronavirus vaccine meets clearly stated standards that it works and is safe. Vaccine development usually takes years but scientists have been racing to shorten that time, in part by manufacturing doses that will have to be thrown away if studies find they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work. \u00e2\u0080\u009cScience will guide our decisions. FDA will not permit any pressure from anyone to change that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hahn said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will put the interest of the American people above anything else.\u00e2\u0080\u009d FDA has faced criticism for allowing emergency use of some COVID-19 treatments backed by little evidence, but Hahn said if vaccine makers want that faster path to market, additional standards will be coming soon. Vaccines, unlike therapies, are given to healthy people and thus usually require more proof. But Trump made clear at a Wednesday evening White House news conference that he was skeptical of any regulatory changes that might delay a vaccine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s authorization, even if those changes are aimed at increasing public trust. Asked about the FDA considering stricter guidelines for emergency approval, Trump suggested the effort was politically-motivated. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think that was a political move more than anything else,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, arguing that that the companies testing the vaccines, such as Pfizer PFE, -0.27%, Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +1.39% \u00c2 and Moderna MRNA, +0.09%, are capable of determining whether they work. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have tremendous trust in these massive companies,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. A handful of vaccines already are in final testing in the U.S. and other countries. In one of the largest studies yet, Johnson & Johnson aims to enroll 60,000 volunteers to test its single-dose approach in the U.S., South Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. Other candidates in the U.S. require two shots. J&J\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vaccine is made with slightly different technology than others in late-stage testing, modeled on an Ebola vaccine the company created. Final-stage testing of one experimental vaccine, made by AstraZeneca AZN, +1.16% \u00c2 and Oxford University, remains on hold in the U.S. as officials examine whether it poses a safety risk. As for the testing of vaccine candidates, Fauci added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is no cutting corners.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Beyond vaccines, Trump regularly undercuts confidence in his own public health agencies, such as falsely tweeting about a \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeep state, or whoever at FDA\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and in recent weeks, some political appointees were forced out after allegations they interfered with scientific advice. Conspiracy theories are sapping the morale of disease fighters working 24/7 at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Robert Redfield, its director, told the Senate committee on health, education, labor and pensions. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s offensive to me when I hear this type of comment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Redfield, noting that CDC, like the military, strives to be nonpartisan. Yet Redfield struggled to defend against criticism that CDC bowed to political pressure with guidelines that discouraged testing of people without COVID-19 symptoms. Asymptomatic people do spread the virus and CDC, under fire, later changed the guidelines\u00e2\u0080\u0099 wording. Redfield insisted it all amounted to misinterpretation and stressed Wednesday: \u00e2\u0080\u009cMore tests will actually lead to less cases.\u00e2\u0080\u009d More than 200,000 Americans have died from COVID-19 so far this year, and in many states infections still are climbing. The U.S. is confirming an average of 41,968 new daily cases, up 13% compared with the average two weeks ago. Fauci was blunt: More lives could have been saved if everyone in the country better followed recommendations to wear masks, avoid crowds and keep 6 feet apart. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe know some states did a good job. Some states did not so good a job. Some states tried to do a good job but people didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t listen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, singling out mask-less crowds in bars. Going forward, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe need uniformity throughout the country.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In a testy exchange, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky insisted public health officials were wrong that a lockdown could change the course of the pandemic. A visibly angry Fauci accused the Republican of repeatedly misconstruing his statements. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t regret saying that the only way we could have really stopped the explosion of infection was by essentially \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I want to say shutting down,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Fauci dismissed Paul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s contention that hard-hit New York has become largely immune because so many people were infected: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you believe 22% is herd immunity, I believe you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re alone in that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss:Watch as Anthony Fauci hits back at Rand Paul over herd immunity: \u00e2\u0080\u0098You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not listening\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Fauci also called attention to so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009clong-haulers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d COVID-19 survivors who continue to struggle with a range of symptoms such as pain, fatigue, even heart damage. He warned much remains unknown about the long-term effects of the virus. Democrats warned those survivors are at risk of being denied insurance if the Trump administration succeeds in overturning an Obama-era health law that forbids companies from turning down people with pre-existing health problems or charging them more. The death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg means there are no longer five justices on the Supreme Court who have upheld the Affordable Care Act. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will see rates skyrocket for anybody who has had COVID,\u00e2\u0080\u009d predicted Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn.

Why? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unusual for a vaccine to be 100% effective. There won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be enough at first for everyone, and even once there is, it will take months to get the shots into the arms of every American who wants one \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an effort CDC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Redfield sees stretching into June or July. Because of the enormous logistical challenges, CDC wants states to get ready now and on Wednesday, announced they would get $200 million to help begin setting up those operations. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe want to do that the instant it is approved. Not the following day but the following moment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said."}]}
