The London-listed oil-and-gas company said the financial position is deemed appropriate given its capital commitments. The announcement follows the completion of Tullow's biannual redetermination of its RBL credit facility, with $1.8 billion debt approved by the lending syndicate. Tullow last month warned of a potential liquidity shortfall by April 2022 and said it would need to negotiate a financial restructuring with its creditors.
