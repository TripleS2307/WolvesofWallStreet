Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast an 8.5% increase. The rebound in U.S. retail sales follows record drop in prior two months, with clothing, home-furnishing stores and stores that sell books, music, sporting goods and other hobby items showing an increase. However, food-service sales were still down 40% in May on the year. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe comeback was much faster than expected, and looks like a beginning of a v-shaped recovery in consumer spending,\u00e2\u0080\u009d wrote Jefferies analysts Aneta Markowska and Thomas Simons in a note. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assuming the positive momentum is sustained, something we remain skeptical about.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098Americans used these funds to keep a roof over their head\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d Nearly one-third (30%) of people said they used their stimulus checks to pay bills, according to a survey released this week, another sign that Americans are struggling to make ends meet, particularly with more than 38 million people filing for unemployment since mid-March. Those bills \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including for cellphones, utilities, cable TV and rent \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are the No. 1 priority, even more than purchasing essentials and \u00e2\u0080\u009crelief spending\u00e2\u0080\u009d on apparel, televisions, video games, sporting goods and toys at Walmart WMT, +1.00%, Costco COST, +1.19% \u00c2 and Target TGT, +1.14%. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s alarming to look at how many Americans used these funds to keep a roof over their head and pay for necessities considering the federal government has not provided clarity about another round of stimulus payments being provided in the near future,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to the report by YouGov.

She\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get a couple of hundred bucks to go shopping.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrong with that? \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmericans are aware of how grim the near future could be, and they took the opportunity to use the stimulus funds to help prepare them for it. By paying off debt, consumers free up some credit so they can turn to it, should they find themselves out of a job in the near future,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it added. Over 160 million stimulus checks are winding their way to households. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a key part of the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s $2.2 trillion CARES Act, but many furloughed and laid-off workers say a maximum $1,200 payment is not enough to see them through another, and perhaps bigger, Great Recession. Although new jobless claims have been falling since March, over 2.2 million applications for unemployment compensation were filed in the last week of May through state and federal relief programs. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost as many as the 2.5 million jobs supposedly regained in the entire month. Other recent findings support the theory that people are struggling to pay bills most of all. As Americans have received their $1,200 stimulus checks, many have used it to keep a roof over their head and food on the table, according to separate research by a team of economists. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGiven the size of the 2020 stimulus checks, we might have expected large impacts on categories like automobile spending, electronics, appliances, and home furnishings,\u00e2\u0080\u009d wrote economists from Columbia University, Northwestern University, the University of Chicago and the University of Southern Denmark. \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098Individuals are catching up with rent and bill payments.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u009cInstead, it seems that individuals are catching up with rent and bill payments as well as engaging in spending on food, personal care and nondurables,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it said. That research analyzed the spending and saving habits of more than 1,600 people who received their stimulus checks by April 21. The study, distributed this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research, provides another look at how the coronavirus outbreak and its economic consequences suddenly left many American families cash-strapped \u00e2\u0080\u0094 especially those making lower incomes. There were glimmers of hope for U.S. workers who are endeavoring to make ends meet with their $1,200 stimulus checks. The Democratic-run House of Representatives approved its HEROES Act, a $3 trillion coronavirus relief package, a fortnight ago, and analysts say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likely next month or later.

What can I do? \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe expect that negotiations over a finalized version of the Phase 4 bill will take at least until the end of May,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Height Capital Markets analysts in a note. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe expect a final package to come together successfully but note that passage will likely be delayed into June.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and the number of deaths continues to rise. As of Wednesday, there are 2,141,306 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the U.S., and 117,030 deaths, and 30,909 deaths in New York, the largest of any state in the country. Worldwide, there were 8,210,642 confirmed cases and 444,563 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. The Dow Jones Industrial Index DJIA, +0.56% \u00c2 and the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% \u00c2 ended higher Tuesday on the back of higher-than-expected retail sales and a report of a potential therapeutic steroid treatment for patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms.
