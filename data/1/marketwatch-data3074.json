The 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.777% edged 0.5 basis point up to 0.689%, while the 2-year note rate TMUBMUSD02Y, 0.156% was steady at 0.143%. The 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, 1.576% was up 0.3 basis point to 1.436%. Bond prices move inversely to yields. What\u2019s driving Treasurys? U.S. consumer prices for August are forecast at a 0.3% increase, cooling from an 0.6% jump in the previous month. The more stable core inflation gauge, stripping out for volatile food and energy prices, is expected to rise 0.2%. Strong inflation numbers can strengthen the narrative that price pressures will normalize as the U.S. economy recovers from the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic. That is likely to weigh on values for longer-dated bonds, which are the most vulnerable maturities to the corrosive influence of inflation. The 10-year breakeven rate was at 1.69%, reflecting what holders of Treasury inflation-protected securities expect price levels to average over the next decade.What did market participants\u2019 say? \u201cIt is hard to build the case for materially firmer core inflation when goods prices are being suppressed by global forces ,\u201d said Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist for RBC Capital Markets."}]}
