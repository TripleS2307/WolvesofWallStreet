Andrew Cuomo said the state has seen an \u00e2\u0080\u009calarming spike\u00e2\u0080\u009d in domestic violence reports during the COVID-19 crisis. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe COVID-19 DV task force chaired by @melissadderosa has issued recommendations that NY will adopt. We will make services more survivor centered and individualized,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Democratic lawmaker tweeted TWTR, -0.23% on Saturday. Mentions of the new coronavirus have cropped up in calls, texts and online chats to the National Domestic Violence Hotline in recent months, as public-health experts urge social distancing and staying home to stem the disease\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spread. One woman told an advocate that COVID-19 had impacted her plans to leave her relationship upon her graduation in May, according to excerpts from the hotline\u00e2\u0080\u0099s log shared with MarketWatch. Her abusive partner was now home 24/7 after being laid off from his job, she said, and had also prohibited her from going to work. \u201c Domestic-violence advocates worry that confining people with their abusers could exacerbate the frequency and intensity of abuse, as the pandemic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic fallout further threatens survivors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 financial stability. \u201d A female caller in California self-quarantining due to her asthma said she was afraid to go to the emergency room after her partner strangled her, citing fear of catching COVID-19. Another contact also expressed coronavirus-related misgivings about seeking medical care after being strangled; the person said they were taking online classes due to a college-campus closure, making it more difficult to maintain distance from their abusive partner. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe threatened to throw me out if I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work from home the rest of the week,\u00e2\u0080\u009d one contact said, according to the advocate log. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe demanded I stay in a hotel and said, if I started coughing, he was throwing me out in the street and that I could die alone in a hospital room. I feel like he will lock me out if I leave for work. My husband won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let me leave the house.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Secretary to the Gov. Cuomo, Melissa DeRosa, told Vogue magazine that the New York task force will endeavor to improve domestic violence services, shelters, support groups and advocacy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn every crisis there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an opportunity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re learning in real time from this pandemic, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exposing the fissures in the system and where we are, where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re headed, and what needs to change around the way we address domestic violence writ large.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She told the magazine that there was a 30% rise in calls to the New York State Domestic Violence hotline. Domestic-violence advocates worry that confining people with their abusers could exacerbate the frequency and intensity of abuse, as the pandemic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic fallout further threatens survivors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 financial stability. Some people have even advocated for banning alcohol sales to reduce the potential for domestic violence in confinement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe CDC is encouraging folks to stay at home; self isolate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Allison Randall, the vice president for policy and emerging issues at the National Network to End Domestic Violence, told MarketWatch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut home is not a safe place for survivors of domestic violence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Indeed, activists in China, where the disease caused by the novel coronavirus was first discovered in December, have told media outlets that reports of domestic-violence cases rose as residents faced lockdowns and quarantines in the epicenter of the outbreak. \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098Our experience informs us that in homes where domestic violence is occurring and there is a negative financial impact or added stress in the home, we typically see a higher frequency of incidents of abuse and severity of abuse.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Katie Ray-Jones, CEO of the National Domestic Violence Hotline Intimate-partner violence \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that is, physical or sexual violence, psychological aggression or stalking by a current or former intimate partner \u00e2\u0080\u0094 impacts millions of Americans annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Around one in four women and one in 10 men over their lifetime have experienced physical violence, contact sexual violence and/or stalking by an intimate partner, and reported an intimate partner-related impact, per a 2015 CDC report.How the pandemic could make domestic violence worse Katie Ray-Jones, the CEO of the National Domestic Violence Hotline, said that her organization didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily expect to see new domestic-violence cases. But \u00e2\u0080\u009cour experience informs us that in homes where domestic violence is occurring and there is a negative financial impact or added stress in the home, we typically see a higher frequency of incidents of abuse and severity of abuse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith COVID-19, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s both the physical isolation together but also increased stress and fear because we are experiencing a pandemic,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sonya Passi, the founder and CEO of the organization FreeFrom, which works to establish financial security for domestic-violence survivors, said in an email. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a dangerous mix, which I expect will leave survivors in an incredibly difficult situation \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not safe to leave the house, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not safe to stay in the house.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Some advocates fear that abusers might wield the coronavirus pandemic as yet another means of control over their victims. Ray-Jones said she believed abusive partners might try to interfere with a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plans to stay safe during the current public-health emergency, such as by sharing misinformation to create fear or by not allowing them to wash their hands. \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098If an abuser will take your checkbook from you so that you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have access to your own finances, if an abuser will take your cellphone and your keys, why wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they prevent you from having access to things that will ensure your healthiness?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Ruth Glenn, president and CEO of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf an abuser will take your checkbook from you so that you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have access to your own finances, if an abuser will take your cellphone and your keys, why wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they prevent you from having access to things that will ensure your healthiness?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ruth Glenn, the president and CEO of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what power and control is about.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Survivors who already found their movements restricted might find that their abusers have a new opportunity to exercise control, Glenn added. And some people might be unsure of what self-isolation or quarantine means for planning their potential escape, she said \u00e2\u0080\u0094 increasing uncertainty about their changing financial situation or access to a shelter, for example. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen you have COVID-19 as an element of risk to what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already a risky endeavor, it adds that much more strain, that much more thinking, that much more element of risk for a survivor when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to leave \u00e2\u0080\u0094 if that is their plan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Glenn said. Social-distancing restrictions could make it even harder for domestic-violence survivors, whose abusers may already isolate them from family, friends and coworkers, to get the social support they need, Randall said. Staying at the home of an elderly parent, who might be at especially high risk for a severe case of the virus, may also be out of the question. Meanwhile, widespread school closures spurred by the spread of COVID-19 could negatively impact children who experience or witness abuse at home. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOften times, schools are the children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s refuge away from a violent home,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ray-Jones said. Childhood exposure to intimate-partner violence is linked with a range of negative physical, emotional, behavioral and educational outcomes in the short and long term, according to the National Child Traumatic Stress Network.The additional financial toll coronavirus could take The lifetime economic cost of intimate-partner violence to society totals $3.6 trillion, according to the CDC, including the cost of medical services, criminal justice and lost productivity. Intimate-partner violence costs about $103,767 for women and $23,414 for men over a victim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lifetime, the agency estimates. Financial or economic abuse is also quite common among domestic-abuse survivors: One 2008 Michigan State University study of 103 survivors found that \u00e2\u0080\u009calmost every woman had been involved with a partner who controlled her use of or access to economic resources and/or took advantage of her economically.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cCoronavirus is exacerbating a problem that already exists and hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been adequately addressed: Survivors of domestic violence cannot afford to leave the abuse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Passi said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor those that do leave, rebuilding their lives is often so expensive that they just end up having to go back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098COVID-19 is going to financially impact almost all of us, but this will be that much more exacerbated for survivors who are already trying to recover from the impact of economic abuse and dealing with the costs of being harmed.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Sonya Passi, founder and CEO of the domestic-violence organization FreeFrom The food and hospitality sector, airlines and other entire industries have cratered under the financial strain imposed by the coronavirus, with some people forecasting a soaring unemployment rate and possible recession. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCOVID-19 is going to financially impact almost all of us, but this will be that much more exacerbated for survivors who are already trying to recover from the impact of economic abuse and dealing with the costs of being harmed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Passi said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cImagine having six figures in debt after being harmed by someone else, no job or cash because both were taken from you, a damaged credit score because of fraud and coerced debt and then a recession on top of that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Study results released by the hotline during the 2009 financial crisis showed that 54% of participants who had called between Nov. 12, 2008 and Dec. 31, 2008 said their household\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial situation had changed in the past year. Some 64% also indicated they believed the abusive behavior had increased over the past year. A 2016 study of intimate-partner violence in the Great Recession, meanwhile, concluded that \u00e2\u0080\u009ceconomic upheaval continues to have a disruptive effect on male-female relationships.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn particular, the rapid worsening of local economies in the Great Recession led to an increase in men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s controlling behavior toward their wives and romantic partners,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the study, which was published in the peer-reviewed journal Demography. Ray-Jones called the present situation \u00e2\u0080\u009ca survivor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worst nightmare on all fronts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re preparing for not-the-best economic circumstances, potentially significant financial impact to homes, and being isolated with an abusive person,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\u00e2\u0080\u0098This is stressful for everyone, but especially survivors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Nonprofits serving vulnerable populations like domestic-violence survivors may be challenged right now, Randall added, by staff that might become sick and a lack of sufficient financial resources. Shelters \u00e2\u0080\u009care doing their very best,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut they definitely need support from their communities right now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d While Ray-Jones said she wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expecting any significant lapses in the hotline\u00e2\u0080\u0099s services, she added that \u00e2\u0080\u009csome local programs will absolutely be impacted.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098We expect survivors to help themselves out of these situations but we all have a responsibility, now more than ever, to support survivors and do our part to address this systemic issue.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Sonya Passi Kavita Mehra, the executive director of the New York-based Sakhi for South Asian Women, said that if her organization were fully operational now, it would have a full team available to support a survivor through experiences with police, family court, doctor visits and benefit-seeking. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNone of those things can happen right now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. The organization has, however, shifted to offer remote tele-therapy and legal services over the phone, and its food justice and cash-assistance programs remain available. Ray-Jones said survivors might find it harder to have private conversations at home at this time, she said, but the organization will be monitoring contact volume, as well as the possibility of text or chat contacts increasing over calls. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause we expect that people are spending more time at home, possibly not leaving the home for work each day, for example, we know survivors are spending more time in closer proximity to their abusers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is stressful for everyone, but especially survivors.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHow survivors can get help \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe ability to reach outreach, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the hotline or your local domestic-violence organization, has not changed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Glenn said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe would encourage survivors to do all that they can to remain safe and know that resources are still available to them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Organizations are devising creative ways to deliver services during this time, she said. Ray-Jones echoed the sentiment: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a time to get connected to resources, because there are a lot of programs across the country who are strategizing to continue to provide some level of support in this incredibly stressful time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. Glenn also advised that survivors make sure that whatever means they have been employing to stay safe are still in place. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEvery survivor is dealing with a different situation, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done their own individual assessment about their safety,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. A safety plan \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that is, a personalized plan to stay safe \u00e2\u0080\u0094 must be even \u00e2\u0080\u009cmore vigorous\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the current situation, given the need to limit interactions with the outside world, Mehra said. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cluxury\u00e2\u0080\u009d of being able to go to multiple locations may no longer exist, she said. So keep important documents handy, know the address of your nearest precinct, have some money on hand (if you have access to money) for calling an Uber UBER, -0.18%, keep a phone on hand, and know which friend or family member\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house you can go to if a shelter is unable to accept you, she said. With that said, domestic violence is a \u00e2\u0080\u009csocietal problem,\u00e2\u0080\u009d not a personal issue, Passi said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe expect survivors to help themselves out of these situations but we all have a responsibility, now more than ever, to support survivors and do our part to address this systemic issue,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. Employers must step up and offer cash support to workers who will be saddled with increased expenses due to quarantines, she said; they should provide paid sick leave to all workers, as well as additional leave for domestic-violence survivors so they can relocate, apartment-hunt and meet with an attorney. Banks and financial institutions also need to lend their support to customers experiencing domestic violence, she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe all have someone in our community whom we know or suspect is in an abusive situation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Passi said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need to be checking in on folks \u00e2\u0080\u0094 asking if they want to talk, asking if they need a couch to crash on, letting them know we are here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}]}
