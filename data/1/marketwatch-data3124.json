Trump recounted a Sunday conversation with Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +2.48% CEO Satya Nadella about the American software giant\u2019s interest in acquiring TikTok from Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd., two days after surprising Wall Street and his own White House by stating that he opposed such a deal and leaned toward banning the app in the U.S. \u201cI did say that, \u2018If you buy it \u2026 a very substantial portion of that price is going to have to come into the Treasury of the United States, because we\u2019re making it possible for this deal to happen.\u2019 Right now they don\u2019t have any rights unless we give it to them,\u201d the president said.

It represents another move against foreign workers as Trump seeks to score points with his core supporters before the November presidential election. Other such efforts include his administration\u2019s June decision to extend a ban on green cards issued outside the U.S. until the end of the year and add many temporary work visas to the freeze, including those used heavily by tech companies XLK, +1.52%. Trump criticized the TVA, saying he had fired two board members, its CEO was overpaid, and he was pushing for that executive's removal. \u201cLet this serve as a warning to any federally appointed board. If you betray American workers, then you will hear two simple words: You\u2019re fired,\u201d he said. In RealClearPolitics averages of polls as of Monday, Democratic challenger Joe Biden was leading Trump by 7.4 percentage points in nationwide surveys and by 5.5 points in top swing states. Trump and his campaign have said pollsters are getting the 2020 race wrong. Also on Monday, Trump tweeted that \u201cJobs, Stocks, and 401k\u2019s\u201d would \u201call come crashing down\u201d if Biden were to become president. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% and S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% closed with modest gains Monday.
