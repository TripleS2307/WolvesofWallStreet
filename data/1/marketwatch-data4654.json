AFP via Getty Images Just one in 10 adults in Britain had used Chancellor Rishi Sunak\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dine-out incentive by the middle of August, and a third are unlikely to do so. These are the findings of a new survey released on Friday by the Office for National Statistics, which found that only 11% had used the measure by Aug. 16. The program is designed to get consumers spending again after the coronavirus lockdown. Although that is a 21% rise from the start of July, the findings will come as a blow to the struggling hospitality sector. Around 80% of hospitality companies shut down in April, with 1.4 million workers furloughed, the highest of any sector, according to government data. The program \u00e2\u0080\u0094 called Eat Out to Help Out \u00e2\u0080\u0094 offers customers in restaurants, pubs and caf\u00c3\u00a9s 50% off meals up to a maximum discount of \u00c2\u00a310. Caf\u00c3\u00a9s, pubs and restaurants reopened indoors in England from July 4, in Scotland from July 15 and in Wales from Aug. 3. A further 41% told the ONS they were very likely or likely to make use of this program during August. However, more than half (51%) said they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to use the incentive because they are worried about catching coronavirus. The survey received 1,533 responses and was conducted between August 12 and 16. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that on the face of it the government program has been a \u00e2\u0080\u009croaring success,\u00e2\u0080\u009d with bookings from Monday to Wednesday soaring by up to 70% according to reservation site Open Table, compared with the same period last year, as diners make the most of cut-price meals.
