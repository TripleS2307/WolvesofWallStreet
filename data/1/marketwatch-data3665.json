MRNA, +0.09% were down 4.7% in premarket trading on Friday, the day after the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ruled in favor of Arbutus Biopharma Corp. ABUS, +1.91% in a patent dispute between the companies. Shares of Arbutus rallied 15.9% on Friday before the market opened. The decision may mean that Arbutus will attempt to make a royalty claim to products developed by Moderna's lipid nanoparticle delivery technology, which is currently being used to develop a COVID-19 vaccine. SVB Leerink's Mani Foroohar said the ruling is a \"disappointing turn\" for Moderna, and \"any meaningful royalty burden could hamper MRNA's pricing flexibility and margin profile vs other players in the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine market.\" Moderna is one of a handful of companies that have moved their experimental coronavirus vaccines into clinical trials, and it was the first company to release Phase 1 data about its vaccine candidate. Since the start of the year, Moderna's stock has gained 285.1% and shares of Arbutus are up 123.0%. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% is up 0.1% year-to-date."}]}
