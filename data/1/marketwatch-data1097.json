The U.S. case toll rose to 6.43 million on Friday and at least 191,800 people have died, according to data provided by the New York Times. That comes after 37,786 new cases were reported on Thursday, above the daily average of 35,629 over the past week, and as the death toll increased by at least 915. \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ever, ever underestimate the potential of the pandemic,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Fauci said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try and look at the rosy side of things.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Dr. Anthony Fauci Fauci, who is head of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases and the White House adviser on the coronavirus, said at a Harvard Medical School webinar Thursday that every day he looks at the COVID-19 data, he gets \u00e2\u0080\u009cmore depressed and more depressed\u00e2\u0080\u009d that daily cases have never declined to the baseline he would like. He said that while daily new cases have come down a bit \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the daily average is down 16% from the average two weeks earlier \u00e2\u0080\u0094 he said it was still an \u00e2\u0080\u009cextraordinarily unacceptable baseline\u00e2\u0080\u009d when considering the economy is reopening. When he presented data showing the reason for the high baseline, when compared with other countries, was likely because the U.S. didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t shut down to the extent of other countries, he \u00e2\u0080\u009cgot a little push back from people in the government.\u00e2\u0080\u009d If there is a lesson to learn, as the Friday marks six months since the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, Fauci said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ever, ever underestimate the potential of the pandemic. And don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try and look at the rosy side of things.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss: Fauci tells Americans to \u00e2\u0080\u0098hunker down\u00e2\u0080\u0099 this fall and winter: \u00e2\u0080\u0098It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not going to be easy.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Also read: Opinion: The COVID-19 pandemic is about to enter its most treacherous phase. His comments come as President Donald Trump faced a backlash over his interview with Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward in which the president said he knew of the dangers of the coronavirus but played down them to not create a panic.
