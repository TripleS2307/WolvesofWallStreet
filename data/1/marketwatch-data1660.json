The president was asked at the news conference about whether he had considered not making his Tuesday trip to Kenosha to avoid adding to tensions, as requested by the city\u2019s mayor and Wisconsin\u2019s governor, both Democrats. \u201cNo, because Kenosha was something we did a good job on,\" Trump said, adding that Gov. Tony Evers eventually agreed to allow the National Guard in. \u201cAs soon as he said \u2018Yes,\u2019 the problem ended. But I have to see the people that did such a good job for me.\u201d \u201cIt could also increase enthusiasm,\u201d the president said of the upcoming trip Kyle Rittenhouse, a white 17-year-old, was arrested last week after two people were shot to death during protests in Kenosha over the police shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at all of it,\u201d Trump said, while referring to video of the incident involving Rittenhouse. \u201cHe was trying to get away from them, I guess, it looks like, and he fell, and then they very violently attacked him.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s under investigation,\u201d he added. \u201cHe probably would have been killed.\u201d Trump said he wasn\u2019t planning to speak with the Blake family and had just talked to their pastor, because they wanted a lawyer on the call and he thought that was \u201cinappropriate.\u201d Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden earlier Monday attacked Trump in a speech in Pittsburgh as \u201ca president who fans the flames, rather than fighting the flames.\u201d Trump is slated to make his own trip to Pennsylvania on Thursday, as he campaigns in Latrobe.
