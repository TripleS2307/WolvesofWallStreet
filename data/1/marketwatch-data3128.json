Initial jobless claims filed the traditional way through state unemployment offices fell slightly in the seven days ended June 13 from 1.57 million in the prior week, the Labor Department said Thursday. It was the 10th decline in a row. Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast a seasonally adjusted 1.35 million new claims Unemployed workers line up in their cars to file applications for jobless benefits in the age of the coronavirus.

These so-called continuing claims, reported with a one-week lag, had peaked in the middle of May at nearly 23 million, but are declining at an agonizingly slow pace. What happened: New jobless claims have fallen steadily from a peak of almost 7 million in late March, but the dropoff has been much slower than economists had expected. They worry a second wave of layoffs is keeping the numbers elevated, posing a potential threat to an economic recovery that\u2019s now in the early stages. See: Marketwatch\u2019s Coronavirus Economic Recovery Tracker The grudging decline in continuing jobless claims appears to offer proof. They give a better idea of how many people are still out of work, whereas new claims only reveal how many people may have lost their jobs at some point during the crisis. At least several million people have since returned to their jobs as the economy has reopened. Digging into the details of the latest claims report, 760,526 applications were submitted in the week of June 13 under a temporary federal relief program put in place after the pandemic began. Forty-six states reported figures for federal claims under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program. If all eight state and federal assistance programs are included, continuing claims totaled an unadjusted 29.1 million in the seven days ended May 30, the most recent data available. That marks a small drop from 29.5 million in the prior week. MarketWatch is also reporting select jobless claims data using actual, or unadjusted, figures to give a clearer picture of unemployment. The seasonally adjusted estimates typically expected by Wall Street have inflated jobless claims during the pandemic and become less accurate.

The more important figure to watch is continuing claims, and while they\u2019ve begun to subside, they are not declining at a pace that points to a rapid recovery in lost jobs. Unless they fall more quickly, and soon, the nascent recovery could be stunted. The latest claims report took place during the same week in which the government surveyed businesses and households in preparation for the employment report for June. The small decline in new claims suggests that net employment gains this month might not be as strong as expected. The government said the economy regained 2.7 million jobs in May. What they are saying? \u201cClaims are slowly, stubbornly falling back toward a \u2018normal\u2019 level, but it is taking a frustratingly long time and seemingly, momentum is stalling out,\u201d wrote Thomas Simons, money market economist at Jefferies LLC, in a note to clients. \u201cContinuing claims have been little changed since mid-May, suggesting a more modest gain in nonfarm payrolls than was reported for May,\u201d said chief economist Scott Brown of Raymond James.
