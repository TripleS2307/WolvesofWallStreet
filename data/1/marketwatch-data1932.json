The company saw users engage more with advertisements even as the advertising landscape remained under pressure due to the COVID-19 crisis. Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal said on Twitter\u2019s TWTR, -0.23% earnings call that recent product improvements and the surge in user growth put the company in an \u201ceven better position to deliver for advertisers\u201d upon the return of sporting events and other live events that tend to bring people over to Twitter. Read: Snap is \u2018executing better than its social media peers\u2019 as it heads into second half of 2020 Twitter\u2019s monetizable daily active users (mDAUs) increased sequentially by 20 million to 186 million for the June quarter, while analysts had been projecting about 172 million. Segal disclosed on Twitter\u2019s earnings call that ad engagements were up 3% from a year earlier during the quarter. Revenue for the quarter slipped to $683 million from $841 million, and came in below the FactSet consensus, which called for $702 million. Twitter generated $365 million of revenue from the U.S. and $319 million from the rest of the world. While Twitter saw a 23% decline in ad revenue, to $562 million, during the period, executives noted that trends improved as the quarter progressed. Ad revenue was down 15% in the last three weeks of the quarter, according to Segal, and he said that Twitter sees \u201cterrific opportunities\u201d to capitalize on the gradual return of live sporting events through sponsorship and advertising now that fans can\u2019t easily congregate in person to talk about games.

Glitches with the product late last year pressured revenue, but Twitter has since made improvements to this advertising feature. Segal didn\u2019t directly answer a question about whether a recent Twitter security breach, which allowed hackers to take over numerous notable accounts, has impacted performance at all in July. \u201cTypically, when we see something like this, we find that although it can be a challenging time for people who use the service, if we...are really transparent about what happened, what we\u2019re doing about it and how we\u2019re working hard to make sure that it can\u2019t happen again, that we can work through these things with the people who use the service, with our content partners, and with advertisers,\u201d he said on Twitter\u2019s earnings call. \u201cAnd so we intend for that to be the case here, but we\u2019re still working through all the details on the security issue, and we\u2019ll just keep people posted, as we have, on Twitter over the last couple of weeks as our work has unfolded.\u201d The company posted a June-quarter net loss of $1.23 billion, or $1.56 a share, whereas it had recorded a GAAP profit of $1.12 billion, or $1.43 a share, in the year-earlier quarter. The year-earlier net income was driven by a large tax benefit. For the most recent quarter, Twitter said in its release that it recognized a $1.1 billion valuation allowance. Twitter saw an adjusted loss per share of $1.39, while analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected the company to break even on a per-share basis. The company recorded $1.58 a share in adjusted earnings a year earlier. MKM Partners analyst Rohit Kulkarni wasn\u2019t too impressed by the results. \u201cFrom a fundamental standpoint, Twitter\u2019s Q2 results were worse than expected, particularly given the advertising revenue trends reported by its peers,\u201d he wrote in a note to clients. \u201cWhile Twitter is cutting variable costs over the near term, we think the cost of growing the business is clearly rising for Twitter as the company seems to be playing catch-up on tech investments.\u201d He rates the stock at neutral with a $34 target price.
