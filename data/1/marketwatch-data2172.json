A fresh decline below the support zone of $1,920-$1,930 would denote weakness.\u201d Indeed, the People\u2019s Bank of China on Monday injected fresh liquidity into its financial system while it kept the rate steady at 2.95% on a one-year medium term lending facility $100.74 billion while it deals with the effects of the viral outbreak, Reuters reported. December gold GCZ20, +2.17% GC00, +2.17% rose $48.90, or 2.5%, to settle at $1.998.70 an ounce, marking its best daily climb on a point and percentage basis since April 22, after the metal on Friday notched a weekly decline of about 3.9%, highlighted last Tuesday by the biggest daily dollar decline since April 15, 2013.
