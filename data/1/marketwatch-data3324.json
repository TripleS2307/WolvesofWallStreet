Fauci said he has observed in video clips and photos that people, particularly younger people, are gathering at bars, not wearing masks, and not social distancing. \"We need to emphasize the responsibility that we have both as individuals and as part of a societal effort to end the epidemic...We've got to get that message out, that we are all in this together. And if we are going to contain this, we've got to contain it together.\" He again urged Americans to wear mask outside and in instances, both indoors and outdoors, where social distancing is not both possible. \"Anything that favors the use of masks, whether it's giving out free masks or any other mechanism, I am thoroughly in favor of,\" he said."}]}
