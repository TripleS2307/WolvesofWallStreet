In a guidance document released in advance of a planned Oct. 22 meeting of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, the FDA said an application should include \"data from Phase 3 studies that includes a median follow-up duration of at least two months after completion of the full vaccination regimen to help provide adequate information to assess a vaccine's benefit-risk profile.\" It is also asking drug makers to wait until there are at least five cases of severe COVID-19 reported among the group of people who received the placebo. The New York Times this week had reported that the Trump administration is trying to block the two-month review in order to speed up the authorization and distribution of coronavirus vaccines. A separate report in Politico this week said that White House officials had told Trump that the drug industry is resistant to the guidelines. There are four COVID-19 vaccine candidates in late-stage clinical trials in the U.S., developed by AstraZeneca AZN, +1.16% AZN, +0.63% and the University of Oxford, BioNTech BNTX, +1.23% and Pfizer Inc. PFE, -0.27%, Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +1.39%, and Moderna Inc. MRNA, +0.09%. None of these companies have released Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical data at this time. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla on Tuesday tweeted that \"Pfizer has never discussed [the FDA's COVID-19] vaccine guidelines with the White House and will never do so as it could undermine the agency's independence.\""}]}
