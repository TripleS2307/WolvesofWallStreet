Placer.ai data shows that there was a jump in traffic the weekend that the Pumpkin Spice Latte made its 2020 debut. Starbucks SBUX, +0.53% \u00c2 brought back the drink on Aug. 25, the earliest launch ever, the retail data company said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSince the start of the recovery, Starbucks visits saw its visit peak when traffic to stores came within 20.1% of 2019 levels \u00e2\u0080\u0093 something that happened the week beginning August 17,\u00e2\u0080\u009d wrote Ethan Chernofsky, Placer.ai\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vice president of marketing, in a blog post. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYet, the Saturday and Sunday following the launch were within 7.7% and 6.2% of 2019 levels of the equivalent Saturday and Sunday in 2020.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Read:Instant Pot has launched a coffee/espresso maker, the Instant Pod, available exclusively at Walmart Starbucks stock has soared nearly 11% over the past month, though shares have slipped 2.3% for the year to date. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% \u00c2 is up 5.2% for 2020 so far. Starbucks uses its menu to combat any slowdowns that take place during the course of the year, Placer said. The superstar PSL is a way to end the warm-weather doldrums and jump start the fall. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaking the PSL launch ever-earlier has been part of a wider strategy to welcome the fall earlier and say goodbye to summer months less oriented to a coffee chain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Placer said. Starbucks has reportedly sold 424 million Pumpkin Spice Lattes since it was launched in 2003. It can be made with non-dairy milk, like oat milk, and other customizations. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s joined this year by new food items, like Hearty Blueberry Oatmeal, and other pumpkin items, like Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew.

Still Stifel analysts upgraded Starbucks in a note published on Aug. 24. Analysts rate Starbucks shares buy with a $90 price target. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUnder the leadership of CEO Kevin Johnson, we have been impressed with the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s willingness and ability to adapt quickly to the changing environment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Stifel said. Starbucks has made changes to its popular rewards program so members could earn points through various payment methods, and made adjustments as stores closed or reopened with new coronavirus-related rules. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn our view, investors should look for companies willing and able to innovate quickly to address the challenges of the current environment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Stifel said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDespite its size, Starbucks has been able to accomplish this feat better than almost anyone in the restaurant industry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Starbucks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 PSL strategy could also provide the rest of retail with a few ideas on how to handle the coming holiday season, which is going to be unlike any other. Watch:How the increase of remote work could help unlock value in the economy \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf Thanksgiving is removed as a retail holiday, it could drive more buzz to Black Friday or give brands an opportunity to create their own \u00e2\u0080\u0098days\u00e2\u0080\u0099 throughout the season,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Placer said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is an obvious benefit to a wider sense of retail urgency that brings visitors into malls and shopping centers. However, even if it just mitigates losses the results could be significant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}]}
