A home warranty is a service contract that covers repair, maintenance and replacement of household appliances or systems. The contract lasts for a specific period of time \u2014 often a year \u2014 and can cover a variety of items depending on the plan. If you have a home warranty and encounter an issue with a home appliance or system, you can file a claim with your provider and arrange for a technician to come assess the problem. Should the appliance or system in question be covered by your plan, you will only have to pay a service fee for the repair. This can save you hundreds \u2014 or even thousands \u2014 of dollars in repair or replacement costs. Home warranties can cover electrical, heating, air conditioning and other systems, as well as appliances like dishwashers and refrigerators. These warranties can be purchased for both old and new homes, and they are especially useful for older homes when you may not know how well valuable household items were maintained by the previous owner.How to choose the best home warranty There are several factors to evaluate when identifying the best home warranty for your needs. Questions to ask include what items you will want to have covered, how high of a monthly payment you are willing to make and whether or not any of you are already covered. It is also important to consider which providers offer coverage where you live. Even if you believe you have found the ideal plan, the company may not cover your area.How is a home warranty different from homeowners insurance? Home warranties are service contracts specific to appliances and systems in your home. By contrast, homeowners insurance covers losses and damages to an individual\u2019s property and belongings caused by an incident that the policy covers. Incidents that are typically covered include fires and natural disasters like hurricanes and tornadoes. Homeowners insurance also commonly offers protection from theft and vandalism. Having both a home warranty and home insurance can bring you peace of mind and protect you from gaps in coverage. For example, a home warranty generally will not apply to personal belongings that are stolen, and homeowners insurance is unlikely to cover a freezer that stops working unless the issue with the freezer was caused by a covered incident. With both, you decrease the likelihood of getting stuck with significant repair bills.Conclusion: Which home warranty is the best for you? The best home warranty company for you will depend on your specific needs. The cost of monthly premiums, service fees, breadth of coverage and consumer ratings are all factors to consider. We recommend American Home Shield as the top home warranty company overall for its fantastic reputation, wide range of plan options and great appliance protection.

This system accounts for a wide range of ranking factors, and we collected data on dozens of home warranty providers to grade the companies on each factor. The end result was a cumulative score for each provider, with the companies that scored the most points topping the list. To ensure our research was as thorough as possible, we called every major home warranty provider directly and spoke with representatives to get quotes, specifics on coverage options, availability based on location and additional information. We also reviewed sample contracts to better understand what each plan covers and to identify limitations. In addition, we simulated the process of reaching out to each company\u2019s customer service team to evaluate their level of helpfulness and ability to solve problems. Once we had gathered all relevant data, we used the following scoring system to grade each home warranty company on a 100-point scale: Overall plan options (5 points possible, weighted X5): Companies that offer a variety of plan options are more likely to meet consumer needs. Thus, we awarded more points to providers that offered more plans and greater flexibility. Cost (5 points possible, weighted X5): Monthly fees and service fees are both taken into consideration. The lower the fees, the higher the score. Trust (5 points possible, weighted X5): Customer feedback on third-party review sites was analyzed to gauge the reputation of each company. Points were deducted for companies that are currently facing or have recently faced civil lawsuits. Customer service (5 points possible, weighted X2): This factor is based on the responsiveness, friendliness and helpfulness of a company\u2019s customer service team. State availability (5 total points possible): Most home warranty companies do not serve all 50 U.S. states. Providers that offer service in the most states scored the highest in this category. Additional benefits (5 total points possible): Promotions and discounts are among the perks that can make a home warranty more attractive to consumers. Companies that offered benefits that competitors didn\u2019t were awarded more points. Coverage specifics (5 total points possible): While the total number of plan options is important, it is also essential to consider what is covered under each plan. The more comprehensive the coverage, the better. All company data is monitored on an ongoing basis so that all rankings and information remain up-to-date."}]}
