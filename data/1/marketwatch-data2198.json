We can also afford to buy a house in addition to this. Please help us find places where it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get too hot in the summer (or colder than Boston in the winter). We also want to live in a place where people are used to and accept different races of people \u00e2\u0080\u0094 maybe a college town? Please help us retire! Victor Dear Victor, Not too hot, not too cold, plus acceptance of whoever we are \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that Goldilocks scenario is what so many people are looking for. With $50,000 to spend in addition to housing, there are many places that can work for you. There also are many other factors you may want to consider that reflect your own interests, so please take these suggestions as a starting point. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for a substantial South Asian community, search for an Indian grocery store. Cary, N.C., and Ann Arbor, Mich., both came up when I looked at a list of Patel Brothers supermarkets, for example. This list of affluent and diverse communities with more than 60,000 residents may inspire other possibilities. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say where you live, unless that reference to Boston weather is my hint. If so, the high property values there could leave you with more money than most for your next house and give you a wider list. I assume you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve considered and ruled out the New York tri-state area, which certainly fits for diversity but has the downside of cost. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m ruling out Florida, Texas and other southern states because of the heat. Here are three college towns to consider. An added bonus: none of these states tax Social Security benefits. As always, make sure you see these places at their worst as well as at their best, whether that reflects the weather, an empty campus or something else. Consider a short-term rental to better explore the area, interact with more residents and decide whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s truly a good fit. Talk to a tax pro if that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a big concern. Moves are costly; you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to make a big mistake. Winding walking path in Pullen Park, Raleigh, N.C.

I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to take sides given the college sports rivalries down there or even try to pick which city is better \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll leave that to readers in the comments section. Gentrifying Raleigh, the state capital, is home to North Carolina State University and is the biggest with 1.4 million people, \u00e2\u0080\u009crough-cut gem\u00e2\u0080\u009d Durham, with close to 285,000 people, has Duke University, and Chapel Hill has the University of North Carolina and about 60,000 residents. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t forget fast-growing, suburban Cary as well as Wake Forest (just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look for Wake Forest University here) and Carrboro, where the heart of downtown is \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the mostly organic food co-op. Homes are most expensive in Chapel Hill and cheapest in Raleigh and Durham.

Downtown Ann Arbor. Getty Images Ann Arbor, Mich. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a quintessential college town: the University of Michigan and its 43,000 students permeate this city of 121,000.

Corvallis isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as diverse as either Raleigh or Ann Arbor, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the more liberal areas in this state.
