That means monetary policy, like interest rates, will stay easier than in the past. Bond yields jumped as investors sold, with the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.777% up 5 basis points to 0.748%. The yield curve - the difference between yields on longer- and shorter- dated bonds - widened. Both conditions make it easier for banks and other financial institutions to make money. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund XLF, +0.11% and the Vanguard Financials ETF VFH, -0.08% were both up 1.7%, while the Invesco KBW Bank ETF KBWB, -0.41% rose 2.1%."}]}
