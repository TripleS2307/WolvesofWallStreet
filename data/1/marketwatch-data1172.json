Opinion:'Wildly out of context' - Peter Navarro on his own words, and the markets in relation to the economy Stating he'd come to the interview with a second point to make in addition to the finger pointing at China, he returned to a longtime favorite Donald Trump topic, saying, \"Hydroxychloroquine needs a second look,\" in light of a new study pointing to prospective mortality-rate improvements in a Detroit hospital system. \"I'm literally sitting on 63 million doses of hydroxychloroquine in the FEMA strategic national stockpile that I can't give away.\" Read on:Trump was being 'tongue in cheek' when he said the U.S. should 'slow the testing down,' White House adviser Peter Navarro says Key Words:Trump contradicts narrative that he was speaking in jest when he appeared to advocate a slowdown in coronavirus testing The WHO over the weekend said it had discontinued studies evaluating hydroxychloroquine and the AbbVie ABBV, +0.41%  HIV drug Kaletra as potential COVID-19 treatments. Navarro, reported to have engaged in at least one heated exchange with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S.'s widely respected top infectious-disease expert, did not seek to paper over any animosity in their relationship. \"He shouldn't be viewed as the oracle,\" Navarro said of Fauci. \"Dr. [Deborah] Birx, she's my heroine. I love how she has really tackled this.\" iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } The trade adviser remained in the science realm when he allowed that the \"reasonable assumption\" of President Trump and perhaps others that, \"come summer, heat and humidity would get rid of the virus\" now appears to have been flawed. Key Words: Trump contradicts Navarro and McEnany narrative that he was speaking in jest when he appeared to advocate a slowdown in coronavirus testing The Margin:Peter Navarro challenges '60 Minutes' on the White House's coronavirus response - it doesn't go very well |"}]}
