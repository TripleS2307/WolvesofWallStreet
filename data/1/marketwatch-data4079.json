Huberty raised her price target on Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stock AAPL, +1.74% \u00c2 to $520 from $431 in a Monday note to clients. The analyst\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new target is now higher than all those listed on FactSet. The stock is up about 2% in morning trading. The price-target hike comes amid a strong rally for Apple shares even as the iPhone maker has faced increased pushback from developers over its App Store practices. Epic Games, the developer of \u00e2\u0080\u009cFortnite,\u00e2\u0080\u009d is suing Apple over what it deems to be \u00e2\u0080\u009cmonopolistic\u00e2\u0080\u009d policies on the platform that it says prevent developers from collecting payments using their own mechanisms within apps downloaded through Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s App Store.

Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives took a similar view in a Monday report. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile the WeChat ban is within the US (App Store), importantly for Apple we believe Chinese consumers should see no disruption with this app which is key especially heading into the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long awaited 5G iPhone 12 supercycle ready to launch in early October,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote. Ives rates Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stock at outperform with a $515 target price. He said he has been \u00e2\u0080\u009cseeing considerable strength from the China region over the last few months, a dynamic we expect to continue heading into the next six to nine months.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Officials from the Trump administration have reportedly sought to privately reassure tech companies that they will still be able to support WeChat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s China business, according to Bloomberg.
