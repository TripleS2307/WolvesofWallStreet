Prime Day, usually a summertime shopping event, was pushed back this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Media reports began circulating last week that Prime Day would take place on Oct. 13. Amazon AMZN, +3.01% did not confirm those reports. The dates were announced just days after the e-commerce giant revealed the latest iterations of its Echo smart speakers and other devices, such as a new home-camera drone. The coronavirus pandemic has upended the shopping calendar, extending the back-to-school period and shifting holiday shopping to an even earlier start. Some experts had proposed that Oct. 10, or 10/10/2020, would mark the start of the holiday shopping season this year.

Historically, other big retailers like Walmart Inc. WMT, +1.00% and eBay Inc. EBAY, +6.47% have benefited from Prime Day as well. Prime Day starts at Oct. 13 at midnight Pacific, though Amazon will begin offering deals on Monday, with Amazon devices and private labels among the items that will be discounted in the lead up. Through Oct. 12, Amazon will also offer a $10 credit to spend on purchases made from small businesses. Amazon said it will invest $100 million on promotional activities catering to small businesses.

Its own Echo Dot device was reportedly one of the best-sellers. E-commerce is expected to be a driver of holiday sales this year as consumers avoid stores amid the pandemic and take greater advantage of options like in-store pickup and contactless delivery and payments. Amazon announced earlier this month that it will hire 100,000 workers across the U.S. and Canada to manage the holiday shopping surge.
