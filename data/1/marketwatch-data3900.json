In its statement after two days of talks, the Fed noted economic activity and jobs \"have picked up somewhat in recent months\" while pledging again to use its full range of tools to support further improvement. \"The Fed came out with no surprises, and basically told the market it would be business as usual going forward - or unusual as the case may be,\" said Brien Lundin, editor of Gold Newsletter. \"With this one, small element of uncertainty removed, gold responded well and resumed its rally.\" Against this backdrop, gold for August delivery GC00, +2.17%  US:GCQ20  was at $1,958.40 an ounce in electronic trading shortly after the Fed statement. It posted a gain of $8.80, or nearly 0.5%, Wednesday to settle at a record of $1,953.40 an ounce on Comex ahead of the Fed news. Gold had also ended at a record $1,944.60 an ounce on Tuesday. The stretch of ninth session gains is the longest such streak since the 10-session climb ended in January. The statement came ahead of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's news conference Wednesday. Investors didn't expect any major tweaks to policy, but look for Powell to maintain a dovish tone, signaling the central bank is committed to maintaining monetary loose policy and is prepared to do more if needed to avert a further downturn. Read: The Fed won't be happy with how the economy is performing, but isn't perturbed enough to take aggressive action The central bank Wednesday said it would keep interest rates near zero until employment recovers and inflation picks up. \"The recent spike in coronavirus cases have prompted re-imposition of restrictions\" and the number of new claimants for unemployment benefits is at over one million, said Sanjeeban Sarkar, commodities editor at The Economist Intelligence Unit. \"These factors bode well for the precious metals market\" and spot gold prices going forward, he told MarketWatch. \"Low interest rates boost gold purchases.\" However, with the Fed's hand tied at the moment, \"the decision to leave rates unchanged is mostly priced in.\" The U.S. dollar extended its decline against currency rivals in the wake of the Fed statement, with the ICE U.S. Dollar DXY, -0.58%  down 0.4% in Wednesday dealings, providing further support for dollar-denominated gold prices. Meanwhile, September silver US:SIU20  added 2 cents, or 0.09%, at $24.321 an ounce. Prices, which settled Monday at their highest since April 2013, trade roughly 25% higher year to date. Silver has rallied \"for many of the reasons that gold is, in that they are both precious metals that are sought as a refuge in times of economic uncertainty and financial market volatility,\" said Jordan Eliseo, manager, listed products and investment research at The Perth Mint. \"Unlike gold which is seen more as a monetary metal by the market, silver is also widely used in industry, which is one of the reasons why price movements (both to the upside and downside) can often be more volatile than the movements seen in gold itself,\" he told MarketWatch. Looking ahead, \"there are no guarantees history will repeat itself, but a growing number of investors are positioning their portfolios to benefit should silver outperform gold in the years to come, as it has over the past three months,\" said Eliseo. Among other metals traded on Comex Wednesday, September copper US:HGU20  edged up by 0.05% to $2.919 a pound. October platinum PLV20, +3.99%  lost 2.8% to $958.50 an ounce and September palladium US:PAU20  fell 4.4% to $2,261.20 an ounce."}]}
