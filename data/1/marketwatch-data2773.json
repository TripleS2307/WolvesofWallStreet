WTI had marked a weekly slide of 8.3% on Friday. Global benchmark Brent oil for August delivery UK:BRNQ20 rose 99 cents, or 2.6%, at $39.72 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe. Prices reversed course after a drop to as low as $37.24 in Monday\u2019s session, which followed a 8.4% decline last week. Both Brent and WTI last week posted their first weekly loss in 7 weeks. Earlier declines in prices followed a warning from oil giant BP PLC that the COVID-19 pandemic will have a lasting economic impact, hurting demand for oil and weighing on energy prices. The energy giant also wrote down as much as $17.5 billion of its assets, noting that the public health crisis may force it to leave fallow some of its energy production assets. \u201cBeijing is having a resurgence of the pandemic, casting doubts that the Americans and Europeans will see much of a break from the virus as it is expected to be back this Fall,\u201d said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, in a market update. \u201cIf the coronavirus continues to see a scattered number of new hotspots, global air travel will not return to pre-pandemic levels anytime soon.\u201d China shut down a produce market in Beijing after a number of new coronavirus infections, while U.S. states, including Florida, California, and Arizona, among others, were seeing infections increase, raising fresh doubts about reopenings and the path for recovery from countries that are facing a recession due to efforts to limit the spread of the deadly pathogen. Still, in a daily report, Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at The Price Futures Group, said it is \u201ctoo early to predict another shutdown of the global economy.\u201d \u201cOil should focus on what seems to be a better outlook when it comes to a rebalancing of global oil supply,\u201d he said, pointing out that the market is seeing \u201cbetter compliance with the most significant [OPEC+] production cut in history, which increases the odds that the reduction will be extended until the end of the year.\u201d Earlier this month, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies extended production cuts of 9.7 million barrels a day by one month, through July. Moya said Monday that oil\u2019s rebound from the lows also \u201ccame from reports that Iraq was living up to their end of the OPEC+ production cuts.\u201d Meanwhile, production in the U.S., which isn\u2019t part of the OPEC+ output agreement, has shown signs of further declines, with the Energy Information Administration on Monday forecasting a July decline of 93,000 barrels per day in oil production from seven major U.S. shale plays. Some economic data, meanwhile, have improved. In the U.S. Monday, the New York Fed\u2019s Empire State Manufacturing Survey showed that business activity steadied in New York in June. The Empire State business conditions index rose 48 points to negative 0.2 in June. \u201cLooking ahead, we expect some consolidation in oil prices here as economic data has been largely better than feared, while the future remains very uncertain regarding the prospects of a \u2018second wave\u2019 that could cripple the energy supply chain for a second time in just three months...especially with the July WTI contract set to expire next week,\u201d said Tyler Richey, co-editor at Sevens Report Research. Back on Nymex, prices for petroleum products ended higher along with oil. July gasoline US:RBN20 rose 3.7% to $1.1657 a gallon and July heating oil US:HON20 added 3.2% to $1.137 a gallon. July natural gas US:NGN20 settled at $1.669 per million British thermal units, down 3.6%. Read:Why natural-gas prices haven\u2019t yet bottomed despite this year\u2019s 20% drop"}]}
