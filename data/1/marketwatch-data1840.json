This year's annual conference theme is \"Examining Policy Prescriptions in an Election Year.\" Photographer: Sarah Silbiger/Bloomberg While the outlook for the U.S. economy is \"complex,\" Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said Wednesday that he remains confident the economy will continue to grow over the rest of the year. \"I do think economic activity began to pick up in May and June and my personal forecast is that will continue into the second half of the year,\" Clarida said in an interview on CNBC. Clarida said the \"good news\" in the outlook was that the economic momentum from mid-May until early July was \"more solid\" than he expected. The \"bad news\" is the recent pickup in coronavirus infections, he said. Clarida said he thought that White House officials and Democrats in Congress would ultimately reach a deal on a new fiscal stimulus package. \"So I think if you mix it all together it's a complex picture but my baseline view for the outlook is not really changed,\" he added. Clarida, who is a member of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's inner circle, said the economy could return to its pre-pandemic level of activity at the end of 2021. That's faster than some other Fed officials have estimated. Stocks opened higher on Wednesday despite the disappointing July ADP reading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% was up 300 points in morning trading ."}]}
