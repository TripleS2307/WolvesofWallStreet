Gavin Newsom has signed a bill that requires company boards to have at least one underrepresented minority member by the end of 2021. Getty Images California will require publicly traded companies headquartered in the state to add minority board members by the end of 2021 under a first-in-the-nation bill signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday. \u201cWhen we talk about racial justice, we talk about power and needing to have seats at the table,\u201d the governor said in a live-streamed press conference, during which he signed other controversial racial-justice bills, including one that would establish a task force to study reparations for African Americans. Assembly Bill 979 requires publicly traded companies based in California to add at least one board member from underrepresented groups \u2014 people who identify as Black or African American, Hispanic, Latino, Asian, Pacific Islander, Native American, Native Hawaiian or Alaska Native, or gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender \u2014 by the end of next year. By the end of 2022, companies with at least nine board members will need to have at least three such directors, and those with four to eight board members will be required to have at least two directors from those groups. \u201cThe lack of diversity on California\u2019s boards and upper-level corporate positions is a challenge we urged corporations to address on their own during our time in the Legislature,\u201d Assemblymember Christina Garcia, D-Bell Gardens, who co-wrote the bill, said in a statement. \u201cHowever, it is clear we can no longer wait for corporations to figure it out on their own.\u201d The new law follows another first-in-the-nation corporate diversity law, SB 826, that mandates the number of women on companies\u2019 boards, which California enacted in 2018 under then-Gov. Jerry Brown. That law has since sparked a couple of lawsuits seeking to invalidate it, with critics claiming it is unconstitutional. \u201cEnding discrimination is a worthy objective,\u201d said Anastasia Boden, an attorney for Pacific Legal Foundation, which has a lawsuit pending against SB 826. \u201cUnfortunately, AB 979 is a pernicious and unconstitutional way of achieving it. The government should treat people as individuals, not according to their immutable characteristics.\u201d Stephanie Creary, an assistant professor of management at Wharton Business School who has published research on diversity in business, called the law \u201cextremely progressive\u201d and said, \u201cThis is a quota, no disagreement about what this is. We already know there will be lawsuits.\u201d However, businesses have expressed their support for the law, including the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, which represents more than 350 companies in tech and other industries. \u201cThe reality is the people whose job it is to interpret the law who say \u2018never pay attention to someone\u2019s demographic traits,\u2019 they\u2019re enabling continued discrimination against women and people of color,\u201d Creary said. \u201cOn boards it\u2019s especially egregious because they are often a reflection of a CEO\u2019s personal network.\u201d She also said the law is a \u201chuge win\u201d for the LGBTQ community, which is rarely included in diversity efforts. California\u2019s secretary of state will be responsible for tracking companies\u2019 compliance with this new law and fining them if needed, just like for SB 826 \u2014 a law that has already been followed by similar proposals in a handful of other states. AB 979\u2019s author, Assemblyman Chris Holden, D-Pasadena, said during the press conference that Newsom\u2019s signing of his legislation and others was \u201cdefinitely a model for the rest of this country to follow.\u201d"}]}
