Speaking during a press conference at the White House, Trump courted the support of those who put stock in the conspiracy theory, saying, \u201cI heard that these are people that love our country.\u201d It was his first public comment on the subject. QAnon has ricocheted around the darker corners of the internet since late 2017, but has been creeping into mainstream politics more and more. The baseless theory centers on an alleged anonymous, high-ranking government official known as \u201cQ\u201d who shares information about an anti-Trump \u201cdeep state\u201d often tied to satanism and child sex trafficking. Trump insisted he hadn\u2019t heard much about the movement, \u201cother than I understand they like me very much\u201d and \u201cit is gaining in popularity.\u201d iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Trump has retweeted QAnon-promoting accounts, and shirts and hats with QAnon symbols and slogans are not uncommon at his rallies. An FBI bulletin last May warned that conspiracy theory-driven extremists have become a domestic terrorism threat. The bulletin specifically mentioned QAnon. Earlier last year, the Southern Poverty Law Center warned that the movement is becoming increasingly popular with anti-government extremists. Pressed on QAnon theories that Trump is allegedly saving the nation from a satanic cult of child sex traffickers, Trump claimed ignorance, but asked, \u201cIs that supposed to be a bad thing?\u201d \u201cIf I can help save the world from problems, I\u2019m willing to do it,\u201d Trump said. Qanon supporters were quick to celebrate Trump\u2019s comments on social media, with many calling them a validation of their views. Many have long contended he sends them coded messages of support, and on Twitter TWTR, -0.23% , one user claimed Trump\u2019s choice of a pink tie on Wednesday was another signal of support. Within minutes, dozens of Instagram users began celebrating Trump\u2019s acknowledgement of the conspiracy theory at the White House podium, uploading videos of him. \u201cWell we\u2019ve been waiting for this moment for a while, to put it mildly thank you @realDonaldTrump,\u201d one Instagram user wrote to her 19,000 followers in a post of Trump\u2019s exchange. The video was viewed more than 1,000 times in just 30 minutes. \u201cHoly Smokin Q,\u201d another tweeted. \u201cOur President was asked 2 questions about the Qanon movement TODAY!! We LOVE you President Trump.\u201d On Parler, a right-wing platform popular with some Trump supporters, one Qanon supporter posted a photo of Trump and a bald eagle. Trump\u2019s comments came a week after he endorsed Marjorie Taylor Greene, who won her GOP House primary runoff in Georgia last week. Greene called the QAnon conspiracy theory \u201csomething worth listening to and paying attention to\u201d and called Q a \u201cpatriot.\u201d Trump praised her as a \u201cfuture Republican Star.\u201d Trump has a long history of advancing false and sometimes racist conspiracies, including last week, when he gave credence to a highly criticized op-ed that questioned Democrat Kamala Harris\u2019 eligibility to serve as vice president even though she was born in Oakland, California. Asked about the matter, Trump told reporters he had \u201cheard\u201d rumors that Harris, a Black woman and U.S.-born citizen whose parents were immigrants, does not meet the requirement to serve in the White House. The president said he considered the rumors \u201cvery serious,\u201d but later he and his campaign indicated they were not making an issue of the claim. Constitutional lawyers have dismissed it as nonsense."}]}
