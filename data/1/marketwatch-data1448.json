The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund XLF, +0.11% and the Vanguard Financials ETF VFH, -0.08% were both down 3.7% at midday, underperforming the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87%, which fell 2.2%. The Invesco KBW Bank ETF, which has more concentrated exposure to banks than a broader financials tilt, was nearly 6% lower, on track for its worst day since June 26. Among the ETFs that track the 11 sectors of the S&P 500, XLE wasn't the biggest loser on Monday: that was the Energy Selector Sector SPDR Fund XLE, -1.59%, down 4%. Energy is still the worst performing sector in the year to date, having lost nearly half its value, while financials are down 23%."}]}
