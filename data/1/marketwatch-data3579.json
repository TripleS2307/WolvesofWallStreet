Shulman is forecasting a 42% annual rate of decline in real gross domestic product for the current quarter, which he says will be followed by a so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cNike swoosh,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or more gradual recovery \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t return the level of output to prior fourth quarter of 2019 peak until early 2023.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cToo many small businesses will fail, and millions of jobs in restaurants and personal service firms will disappear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Shulman wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor too many workers, the recession will linger on well past the official end date of the depression.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Check out: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Finance is, like, done. Everybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bought everybody else with low-cost debt\u00e2\u0080\u0099 says ValueAct co-founder Jeff Ubben \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Elizabeth Warren was right\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Shulman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s forecast comes as the U.S. counted 34,700 new confirmed cases on Wednesday, according to the Associated Press, the highest level since a late April peak number of 36,400. While New York and neighboring states have succeeded in flattening their infection curve, 29 states still see increasing cases over the last 14 days, according to a New York Times tracker. The resurgence of the viral outbreak, which has infected 9.5 million people world-wide, has delayed business reopenings in many parts of the U.S. and compelled Texas to pause its reopening plans. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said he froze the reopening of the state in response to the spike in cases of COVID-19 and hospitalizations. Shulman told MarketWatch that when he prepared the economic forecast, the viral outbreak looked to be more contained and acknowledges that his grim prediction could be even worse if the virus gets out of control in many of the hotspot states. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen we did this report, we assumed the path was getting better,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis big acceleration [in cases] happened in the past week,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. The economist said that the surge in infections and hospitalizations could lead individuals to impose their own lockdowns, notwithstanding any put in place by local and federal governments. Meanwhile, the stock market has been focused on bright spots in the economy and has been mostly disconnected from a labor market that continues to demonstrate softness, even if the worst of the acceleration in job losses has passed.

For Shulman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part, he finds the market\u00e2\u0080\u0099s moves befuddling. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI really don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand the market. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not a day trader,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Shulman told MarketWatch, while also saying he is not an epidemiologist. That said, he thinks that if a vaccine arrives, which he predicts could hit in the first quarter of 2021, the rebound in the economy could take fuller shape. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf the vaccine works quicker, it could be a better outcome for the economy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.
