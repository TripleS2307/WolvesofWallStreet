Denver-based Liberty Global LBTYA, +6.10% \u00c2 will pay SFr110 to acquire Sunrise SRCG, +0.27%, representing a 28% premium to the Swiss telecom company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s closing share price of CHF86.20 on Tuesday. The deal will be funded from Liberty Global\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cash reserves and debt. Mike Fries, Liberty Global Chief Executive, said the takeover of Sunrise would create a competitor to incumbent player state-controlled telecoms group Swisscom SCMN, +0.02%. He said Liberty Global would consider a SRCG, +0.27% flotation of Sunrise in the future, once the takeover is completed and the operations are running smoothly and some synergies have been realized. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think that is a very good chance of happening. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a problem with publicly listed companies. Our operating company in Belgium is a publicly listed company, of course,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Fries said, adding that Swiss investors generally are attracted to local companies, especially in the telecom space, which have strong and sustainable cash flows. Shares in Sunrise Communications were trading almost 26% higher to 108.6 francs in early morning European trading. The combined business would have SFr3.17 billion in revenue, 2.1 million mobile postpaid subscribers, 1.2 million broadband subscribers and 1.3 million television subscribers, reflecting approximately 30% market share in each segment, Liberty Global said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe industrial logic of this merger is undeniable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Fries said. The takeover comes less than a year after Denver-based Liberty Global was forced to scrap the attempted $6.4 billion sale of its Swiss cable business UPC to Sunrise Communications Group after Germany\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Freenet \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Sunrise\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest shareholder, with 24% of the stock \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and influential proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services, opposed the deal. Freenet FNTN, -0.98% \u00c2 is backing the sale of Sunrise to Liberty Global. Liberty\u00e2\u0080\u0099s billionaire chairman Malone has been on an mergers and acquisitions spree since the late 1990s, earning him the \u00e2\u0080\u009cCable Cowboy\u00e2\u0080\u009d moniker. The group has carried out more than 370 transactions since 2005. The group built up a $12 billion cash acquisition war chest in 2018, after selling its German and Eastern European cable assets to Vodafone Group VOD, -0.05% for $21.8 billion.
