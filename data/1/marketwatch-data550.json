The third quarter economic backdrop was \u201cvery supportive of the overall commodity complex,\u201d including industrial metals, says John Caruso , senior asset manager at RJO Futures. \u201cThe \u2018reflation\u2019 trade, assisted by the reopening of the economy and record [Federal Reserve] and government stimulus, helped the metals complex gain plenty of fervor\u201d following the second quarter Covid-19-related shutdown and economic collapse. On Sept. 30, silver futures SIZ20, +5.96% posted a 26% climb for the third quarter and copper futures HGZ20, +1.38% finished about 11% higher. \u201cOptimism around the reopening of the global economy, a continued rally in risk-on assets, improving global economic data, and the hopes of additional stimulus helped propel the upward movement in industrial metals,\u201d says Ed Egilinsky, managing director, head of alternatives at Direxion. The recent moves in the metals \u201ccertainly support a narrative that the worst of the economic slowdown exacerbated by Covid-19 might be behind us.\u201d At the same time, however, news of President Donald Trump\u2019s Covid-19 diagnosis on Oct. 2 also \u201cadds to the narrative of the ongoing global susceptibility to this virus,\u201d he says. There has already been a reemergence of cases in parts of the world that can \u201clead to a global slowdown and a \u2018risk off\u2019 sentiment,\u201d adversely impacting industrial metals. Silver\u2019s quarterly performance was impressive, especially when compared to a more modest 5.3% rise in gold futures for the same period. Silver \u201cbenefitted from both the industrial and investment side of its demand equation\u201d during the quarter, says Maria Smirnova, senior portfolio manager at Sprott Asset Management. Demand for the metal has been rebounding along with the world economy and its appeal as an investment has also climbed, reacting just like gold to declining real interest rates and the U.S. dollar index. Copper, meanwhile, known as a leading indicator of economic health because of its broad use in a range of industrial applications, posted a gain for a second straight quarter. Futures prices settled as high as $3.116 a pound on Sept. 18, the highest since June 2018. \u201cGlobal growth has seen a sharp recovery off the March lows\u201d on the heels of the \u201cmassive monetary and fiscal policies that were put in place by many central banks in early spring to help stabilize the economic slowdown caused by the pandemic,\u201d says Stephanie Link, chief investment strategist and portfolio manager at Hightower Advisors. In the U.S., momentum has been \u201csignificant,\u201d especially in housing, auto and manufacturing, she says. \u201cIf copper prices go up, that is a signal of better economic health and if it goes down, it indicates the opposite,\u201d she says, adding that the \u201cmassive stimulus globally\u201d will lead to better economic growth and \u201cshould keep a bid on industrial metals, including copper.\u201d Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, however, Caruso warned of \u201cadditional challenges\u201d for the U.S. and global economic growth outlook, including a rise in Covid-19 cases, a \u201cvery pivotal\u201d U.S. election, and lack of additional plans for stimulus. \u201cWe\u2019re not nearly as bullish on the commodity complex for Q4 as we once were back in June,\u201d and the quarter is likely to be \u201cless friendly\u201d to industrial metals than the quarter just ended, Caruso says. Gold may hold up the best in a \u201crisk-off\u201d scenario in global markets, but industrial metals \u201cmay begin to underperform.\u201d Still, \u201cthere\u2019s a high probability of a major infrastructure deal pending in Washington,\u201d and that coupled with a \u201cfavorable outlook\u201d for the U.S. and Chinese economies should keep demand strong for the industrial metals well into 2021, he says."}]}
