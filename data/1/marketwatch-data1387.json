Restaurants and bars will be allowed to serve customers indoors at a reduced capacity, while tattoo artists, nail salons and spas will accept customers for the first time in three months. Eateries and salons located in malls might have months before they can reopen, however, as a member of the state\u2019s coronavirus task force reportedly said that malls, movie theaters and gyms won\u2019t reopen as part of the fourth and final phase, the Albany Times Union reported on Tuesday. So far, only mall stores with exterior entrances have been allowed to reopen, leaving most indoor shopping centers as well as gyms and theaters in limbo for the foreseeable future. State budget director Robert Mujica reportedly broke the news to local leaders in a conference call on Tuesday, the Times Union reported. The governor\u2019s office did not immediately return a request for comment.

On Monday, 77 people on Long Island tested positive for coronavirus, down from a daily high of several thousand in early April, according to the state health department. Statewide, just under 600 people tested positive for the disease on Monday and 27 people died, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said on Tuesday, reiterating the state\u2019s gradual approach to reopening. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing in other states what happens when you just reopen with no regard for metrics or data \u2014 it\u2019s bad for public health and for the economy,\u201d Cuomo said in a statement. Long Island follows the Hudson Valley, which entered Phase 3 on Tuesday. Both areas provide some respite to New York City residents, who live in between and who\u2019ve only just begun Phase 2 of reopening this week. New York is now one of only three states on track to contain the virus, according to Covid Act Now, a multidisciplinary organization of data scientists, epidemiologists and other public health experts. The only other states successfully containing the disease are Massachusetts and New Jersey.

Other New York City developments: Child care funding: As parts of the state move toward the fourth and final phase of reopening, Cuomo announced the state would put aside $65 million in federal funding it received through the CARES Act to support child care programs. Centers can apply for a grant to cover 50% of the cost of opening a new classroom, up to $6,000.
