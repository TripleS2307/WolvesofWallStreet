U.S. states, including Arizona, Texas, South Carolina and Florida, saw confirmed cases rise by more than 30% over the past week, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. West Texas Intermediate crude for August US:CLQ20 fell 23 cents, or 0.6%, to settle at $38.49 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, following a 1.9% gain on Thursday. US:CLQ20 Global benchmark Brent oil for August delivery UK:BRNQ20 shed 3 cents, or 0.07%, to end at $41.02 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe, after a 1.8% advance in the previous session. For the week, WTI saw a 3.4% decline, while Brent lost 2.8%, based on the most-active contract settlements last Friday, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Data from Baker Hughes BKR, -1.34% Friday showed little change in the weekly U.S. oil-rig count, which fell by just 1 to stand at 188. The number of active U.S. oil rigs has not seen an increase since the week ended March 13. Helping to provide some support for prices was a report from Reuters, using satellite data, pointing to a pick up in traffic in China, Europe and the U.S., that could be upbeat for energy uptake. However, that contrast with a survey of economists by Reuters that indicates expectations for a deeper global recession than earlier estimates, which could ultimately prove a headwind for oil prices in the future. In a note dated Thursday, Bethany Beckett, assistant economist at Capital Economics, said \u201cgiven that we now expect China GDP growth to return to its pre-virus path by end-2020, domestic oil demand is likely to recover in tandem.\u201d The picture outside of China, however, is \u201cmuch less rosy,\u201d she wrote. In the U.S., \u201cwe expect that the rapid rebound so far in gasoline demand will soon run out of steam and that it will only rise gradually thereafter.\u201d \u201cAll told, it is clear that the near-term outlook for oil prices is fairly gloomy,\u201d said Beckett. Capital Economics stuck to its price forecasts for Brent and WTI to reach just $45 a barrel by the end of this year.
