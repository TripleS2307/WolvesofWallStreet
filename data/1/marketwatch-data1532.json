Square Square Inc. seems to be following the same playbook with its consumer-facing Cash App that it did with its merchant-oriented card-processing business, and that\u2019s one reason to be upbeat about its stock, according to Oppenheimer analyst Jed Kelly. Read: Square to offer early access to earned wages for employees of its merchants He upgraded shares of Square SQ, +2.06% to outperform from perform Thursday, arguing that the company could see an \u201cequal level of success\u201d with the Cash App as it did with its card-processing dongle in the early 2010s. The stock is up 1.5% in morning trading. Kelly is optimistic about the company\u2019s ability to continue amassing a wide base of users by offering free peer-to-peer payment services and then finding ways to monetize those users with things like the Cash Card debit card and small fees for those who want to instantly transfer their funds to their bank accounts. \u201cWe believe by reinvesting profits from prior Cash App cohorts, combined with its seller ecosystem, Square can develop significant network effects and products that will be challenging for other neo-banks to replicate in the digital wallet space,\u201d he wrote in his note to clients, while $185. Square estimates a $63 billion total addressable market for the Cash App. Read: Venmo and Square\u2019s Cash App were going gangbusters before the pandemic \u2014 now they\u2019re doing even better Separately, Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev also chimed in with a cheery view of the Cash App Thursday, calling the business \u201cunstoppable\u201d and writing that the service\u2019s total addressable market could double if Square got into new areas like small loans, insurance, and wealth management. Dolev wrote that the company benefits from better unit economics than traditional banks or neobanks because the Cash App\u2019s peer-to-peer service enables it to more cheaply acquire new customers. Because of this, \u201cSquare does not need to recoup acquisition costs by offering mortgages like banks do,\u201d he said. In Dolev\u2019s view, investors shouldn\u2019t worry about the sustainability of the Cash App\u2019s revenue growth because \u201cnew products like Cash Card are following similar trajectories of the successful Instant Deposit product.\u201d He maintained a buy rating and $225 price target on the stock. Square shares have rallied 141% so far this year compared with near flat performance for the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87%."}]}
