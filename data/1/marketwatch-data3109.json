His latest investment raises some questions", "body": "Warren Buffett has long been critical of gold as an investment, saying that it \u201chas no utility\u201d and that the \u201cmagical metal\u201d is no match for \u201cAmerican mettle.\u201d He once wrote, \u201cAnyone watching from Mars would be scratching their head\u201d over how we treat the shiny stuff on this planet. Yet the Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A, +0.06% BRK.B, +0.24% boss just acquired nearly 21 million shares of Barrick Gold GOLD, +2.86% worth $563 million, while selling shares of Wells Fargo WFC, and J.P. Morgan Chase JPM, -0.57%, according to 13-F filings released Friday afternoon. The move kicked up buzz among gold bugs and other Wall Street watchers across the internet, who saw Buffett\u2019s trades as perhaps signalling a shift in his views on the market. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } The popular Zero Hedge blog took a deep dive into Buffett\u2019s repositioning, saying that it\u2019s \u201ca signal that none other than the Oracle Of Omaha appears to now be quietly betting against the United States,\u201d because \u201cthe famously anti-gold investor has abandoned banks \u2014 the backbone of America\u2019s credit-driven economy \u2014 in favor of a gold miner.\u201d Of course, while gold bugs and staunch market bears come up with their own conclusions, Berkshire is still, nevertheless, deep into the banks, including Bank of America BAC, +0.47% , where it\u2019s been pouring its money into over the past month. Mike Shedlock of Sitka Pacific Capital Management took exception to the interpretation of the news, explaining in a blog post that it\u2019s as simple as \u201cBuffet [sic] knows financials are struggling due to COVID. And Barrick pays a dividend.\u201d Furthermore, Barrick is merely a tiny piece of his overall pie, and Buffett didn\u2019t back off his stakes in Amazon AMZN, +3.01% or Apple AAPL, +1.74%. \u201cThis is neither a huge cave-in nor a fundamental sea of change regarding gold,\u201d Shedlock wrote. \u201cPotentially it is a short-term sell signal that corresponds to the recent pullback.\u201d Meanwhile, the stock market continues to stalk record highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% closed with a 1.8% weekly gain, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% briefly traded at a record before ending the week up less than 1%. The Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39% finished barely higher for the week, as well. The index has posted 32 records so far in 2020. Barrick Gold, at last check, was up more than 8% after hours."}]}
