Investors remain hopeful that lawmakers can strike a deal on a fresh round of coronavirus relief for those Americans out of work, while both Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said they remained optimistic on an agreement. Democrats and Republicans have been at loggerheads, as they run up against a self-imposed deadline of Friday, over the scope of any new aid package, including over how much to provide in federal jobless assistance, which provided an extra $600 a week before it expired in July, in addition to state-provided benefits. \u201cI think investors feel there\u2019s relief coming,\u201d said Sahak Manuelian, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles, in an interview, adding that with more stimulus likely, bond yields near record lows and second-quarter earnings mostly surprising to the upside, there\u2019s \u201cjust not a good reason to sell stocks.\u201d The Trump administration on Wednesday also floated the idea of taking executive action if Democrats and Republicans aren\u2019t able to reach a compromise on providing further assistance to those worst hit by the viral outbreak. \u201cIf Congress can\u2019t get it done, the president of the United States will,\u201d White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told CNN in a Wednesday interview, a point that Trump reiterated at a news conference. \u201cWe are negotiating right now as we speak, and we\u2019ll see how it works out,\u201d the president said. Stocks also received a boost Thursday afternoon, after the State Department, in coordination with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said it was lifting its global advisory against international travel for Americans that has been in place since March because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The U.S. Global Jets Exchange Traded Fund JETS, +0.16%, which tracks a basket of airline and aircraft stocks, closed up 2.2%, beating the day\u2019s gains for the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index. Earlier, investors took heart after the number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the week ended Aug. 1 fell to a three-week low of 1.186 million, a decline of 249,000 from the previous week\u2019s reading of 1.435 million. The average estimates from economists polled by Econoday were for a weekly increase in new claims to 1.442 million. The number of people receiving traditional jobless benefits through the states, known as continuing claims, dropped by a seasonally adjusted 844,000 to 16.1 million in the week ended July 25. \u201cThe pressure is coming off just slightly in the labor markets with unemployment claims coming down from recent highs,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG, but he added that jobless claims still remain elevated and nearly double the level last seen in at the depths of the 2007-\u201909 recession. A steady decline in jobless claims briefly came to a halt in July amid a surge in coronavirus cases in California, Texas, Florida and many other states. Some restrictions were reimposed on businesses and companies were forced to lay off or furlough workers, some for the second time. Confirmed global cases of COVID-19 approached 19 million on Thursday, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University, and the death toll rose to 708,036. The U.S. case tally climbed to 4.8 million, while the death toll rose to 158,256. Rising cases have put in doubt hopes for a so-called V-shaped, or sharp and quick, economic recovery from the recession created by the pandemic.
