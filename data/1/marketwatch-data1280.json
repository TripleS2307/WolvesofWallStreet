Joshua Roberts/Getty Images President Donald Trump, saying he needed to take a phone call, departed Wednesday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coronavirus press briefing as a reporter asked him about protests in Louisville, Ky., after no police officer was charged directly over the shooting death of Breonna Taylor. One officer was charged with wanton endangerment for firing shots into neighboring apartments. Trump applauded Attorney General Daniel Cameron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s response to the case. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s handling it very well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said, after reading a statement from Cameron that said justice is beholden \u00e2\u0080\u009conly to the facts and to the law.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we simply act on emotion or outrage, there is no justice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Cameron, a Republican, who is often described as a prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9 of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098Get rid of the ballots, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have a very peaceful \u00e2\u0080\u0094 there won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be a transfer, frankly, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be a continuation.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 President Trump, asked at the press briefing whether he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d commit to a peaceful transfer of power Trump said he would soon speak with the Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, and supported Beshear\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to call up the National Guard in response to protests. The president would not commit to a peaceful transfer of power in the event of his defeat on Nov. 3, referring to his complaints over mail-in ballots. The president has repeatedly railed against voting by mall, though there is little evidence it facilitates fraud. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to have to see what happens,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe ballots are a disaster.

He said he has \u00e2\u0080\u009ctremendous trust\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the companies conducting vaccine trials. Opinion:\u00c2 Everything you need to know about what it would take for the FDA to approve a COVID-19 vaccine \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen [the drug companies] come back and say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098We have something that works and absolutely works,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re coming back with great numbers and statistics, and tests, and everything else that they have to come back with, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see any reason why it should be delayed further,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf they delay it a week or two weeks or three weeks, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of lives we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump, formerly a public vaccine skeptic, asked Americans to get their annual influenza shot, noting that the flu season could cause confusion due to overlapping symptoms with COVID-19. Trump said he would announce on Saturday his nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court left following the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the person I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be putting up is highly qualified, totally brilliant, top-of- the-line academic student, the highest credentials \u00e2\u0080\u0094 all of them have that\u00e2\u0080\u0093 and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see on Saturday who that is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t imagine why a Democrat wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t vote for this person.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recent endorsement of Joe Biden, Trump said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not a fan of hers.
