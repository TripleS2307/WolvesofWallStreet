The therapy did not meet the study's primary or secondary endpoints. There was no difference in the number of patients who died by week four among those taking Actemra or placebo, though the company said Actemra may speed up recovery times for hospitalized patients, a finding that needs further analysis. \"We are disappointed that [the study] did not demonstrate a benefit for patients in either clinical status or mortality at week four,\" Dr. Levi Garraway, Roche's chief medical officer, said in a news release. The global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial was conducted with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority. Earlier this year there was hope that rheumatoid arthritis drugs could serve as possible treatments for COVID-19 patients; however, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s REGN, +0.36% and Sanofi's SNY, +0.89% RA drug Kevzara also had some limitations treating these patients in a recent mid-stage COVID-19 trial. Roche's stock is up 10.4% year-to-date, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% is down 0.3%."}]}
