The first two quarters of the year couldn't have been more different and uncertainty is still heightened, with a number of U.S. states reversing their reopenings and reporting virus spikes. SunTrust Advisory chief market strategist Keith Lerner said that while history was \u00e2\u0080\u009conly a guide,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he expected it to be repeated with the onset of a bull market and the S&P 500 higher in a year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time.

Following the top 10 best quarters since 1950, the index has climbed every time in the next quarter with an average 8% jump. On three occasions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in 1970, 1998 and 2009 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the strong quarter was also preceded by a double-digit percentage fall, as it was this time around. The index was higher one year later following nine out of the 10 best quarters, with the exception of the 1987 stock market crash, SunTrust\u00e2\u0080\u0099s study found. Lerner warned markets wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t track the past exactly, and stressed there was great uncertainty around the pandemic and \u00e2\u0080\u009cwider-than-normal\u00e2\u0080\u009d potential outcomes.
