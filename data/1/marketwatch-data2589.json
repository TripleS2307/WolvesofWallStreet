Enthusiasm for equities, however, momentarily buckled earlier in the session after a report on consumer confidence highlighted a division in the perception of the economy on Main Street compared with Wall Street, where equities have recovered to new record highs recently. What did major benchmarks do? The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% traded 60.02 points, or 0.2%, lower to close at 28,248.44, while S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% ES00, +1.13% rose 12.34 points, or 0.4%, to end at 3,443.62, marking its 17th record close of the year. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.39% climbed 86.75 points, or 0.8%, to end at 11,466,47, to end near its intraday record high and log its 38th record finish of 2020. What drove the market? Investors were heartened overnight by news that U.S. and Chinese officials reaffirmed their commitment to a trade deal signed in January, but questions about the power of investors to help the economy mount a more substantial recovery from COVID-19 were thrown into some doubt after a reading on U.S. consumer confidence. Consumer confidence fell in August to a new pandemic low after a fresh rash of coronavirus cases during the summer. The index of consumer confidence sank to 84.8 this month from a revised 91.7 in July, the Conference Board said Tuesday. Economists polled by MarketWatch had expected a reading of 93.0. \u201cHouseholds are becoming more cautious in their outlook for continued healing of the economy,\u201d wrote Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics, in a research report. \u201cThis could slow consumer spending relative to the rather strong rebound over the past few months,\u201d she said. Analysts tied the positive tone across global equity markets in part to remarks following a phone call between U.S. and Chinese officials over the status of the partial trade agreement, despite rising tensions over Beijing\u2019s treatment of Hong Kong and other issues. China described the call as a \u201cconstructive\u201d discussion between Vice Premier Liu He, the country\u2019s top negotiator, and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The U.S. said both sides \u201csee progress and are committed to taking the steps necessary to ensure the success of the agreement.\u201d The call came after plans for a discussion earlier this month were postponed. \u201cGiven the exchanges between the two countries recently have been negative, any small bit of positivity is seen as a big step forward, even when it isn\u2019t,\u201d said David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets, in a note. \u201cThe Chinese government are still well behind on their commitments to purchase U.S. goods, but to be fair, some of that is down to the pandemic.\u201d Investors were also processing the potential impact of Hurricane Laura, which was bearing down on the Gulf Cost region, with 345,000 people ordered to evacuate the area on Tuesday. The storm is projected to become a Category 3 hurricane, capable of producing winds of around 115 mph, on Wednesday as it hits Texas and Louisiana.
