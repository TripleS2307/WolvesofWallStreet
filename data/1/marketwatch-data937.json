Dexamethasone, a type of corticosteroid, has been considered a treatment only for severely ill COVID-19 patients; \"corticosteroids also appear to be associated with benefit among critically ill patients with COVID-19 whether they are receiving mechanical ventilation or oxygen without mechanical ventilation,\" researchers wrote in September in a JAMA editorial. One of Trump's physicians said Sunday morning during a press conference that Trump received the first dose of dexamethasone on Saturday."}]}
