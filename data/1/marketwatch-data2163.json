Originally scheduled as an in-person event in Milwaukee, the convention has instead changed to something resembling a four-day Zoom ZM, +2.89%  meeting thanks to the coronavirus pandemic. Biden will accept the nomination on Thursday from his home state of Delaware, and speakers including vice-presidential pick Kamala Harris and party stars like Bill Clinton and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will be addressing fellow Democrats via video instead of onstage in Wisconsin.

But voters and investors will find plenty to chew on from four nights of prime-time speeches, including how Biden attempts to unite progressives and establishment Democrats and how he might further detail economic policies. The event's speaking schedule is a nod to Biden's effort to bring a disparate party together. Sen. Bernie Sanders, who battled Biden for the nomination, has been given a speaking spot, as has fellow progressive Ocasio-Cortez.

That's despite Biden's rejection of policies like Medicare for All, which Sanders championed. Read:Biden leads Trump, 50% to 41%, new poll finds. Trump has charged that the Biden-Harris ticket could sink stock markets DJIA, +0.56%  and the economy - though at least one analyst has said that it's a Democratic sweep of the White House and Congress that would be best for the economy in the long run.
