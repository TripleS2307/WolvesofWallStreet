Originally scheduled as an in-person event in Milwaukee, the convention has instead changed to something resembling a four-day Zoom ZM, +2.89% \u00c2 meeting thanks to the coronavirus pandemic. Biden will accept the nomination on Thursday from his home state of Delaware, and speakers including vice-presidential pick Kamala Harris and party stars like Bill Clinton and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will be addressing fellow Democrats via video instead of onstage in Wisconsin.

Trailing Biden in national and swing-state polls as well as betting markets, Trump is attacking the former vice president as beholden to the left of his party, as exemplified by the likes of Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s despite Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rejection of policies like Medicare for All, which Sanders championed. Read:Biden leads Trump, 50% to 41%, new poll finds.
