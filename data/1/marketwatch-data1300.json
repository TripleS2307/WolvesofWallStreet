The second of three debates will have a different format than the first, with the candidates fielding questions from South Florida-area residents in a town-meeting-style event. The participants will be uncommitted voters chosen under the supervision of Frank Newport, senior scientist with Gallup, according to the Commission on Presidential Debates. Trump and Biden frequently talked over each other during the first debate, and moderator Chris Wallace drew flak from partisans and pundits for his handling of the event. Wednesday afternoon, the debate commission said it would announce steps to ensure \u201cadditional structure\u201d in the remaining contests. Steve Scully, C-SPAN\u2019s political editor, will moderate the second debate. Like Tuesday night\u2019s debate in Cleveland, the Miami face-off will begin at 9 p.m. Eastern and run for 90 minutes without commercials.
