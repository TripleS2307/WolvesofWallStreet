He said SARS-CoV-2, the name for the virus that causes COVID-19, will continue to spread unless everyone ups their game. On Tuesday, in an interview livestreamed on Twitter TWTR, -0.23% and Facebook FB, +0.26% \u00c2 with the head of the National Institutes of Health, Francis Collins, Fauci said that unlike Europe, U.S. communities \u00e2\u0080\u009cnever came down to baseline and now are surging back up\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still knee-deep in the first wave.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Fauci previously said the virus may be mutating to become more transmissible, and focused on three main failings by both the public and authorities: Many states have reopened too quickly, people are not abiding by rules of social distancing, and the authorities could do a better job at contact tracing to track people who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been in contact with those who test positive. \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098We do need to open up again, no doubt about it, we want to get the economy back, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to do it in a measured way, and now we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing the consequence of community spread, which is even more difficult to contain.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Anthony Fauci, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat we saw were a lot of people who maybe felt that because they think they are invulnerable, and we know many young people are not because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting [this] serious disease; therefore they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting infected has nothing at all to do with anyone else when, in fact, it does,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Fauci told lawmakers in D.C. last week. The main reason: Those who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t social distance are putting more senior Americans at risk. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor COVID-19, the elderly have been overwhelmingly the worst hit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to an analysis by Deutsche Bank. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor the Spanish flu of 1918, the young working-age population were severely affected too. In fact, the death rate from pneumonia and influenza that year among 25-34-year-olds in the United States was more than 50% higher than that for 65-74-year-olds. A remarkable difference to COVID-19.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Francis Yared, the global head of rates research at Deutsche Bank DB, -0.85%, said the overall mortality rate measured by weekly new deaths and weekly new cases is around one-third of the level observed in the second half of April. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo we have an interesting situation at the moment, where rapidly rising cases in the U.S. are slowing reopenings (negative) but the death rate is falling (positive). This may eventually give us more faith that we are now better at living with the virus,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Deutsche Bank said. COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, had infected 11.9 million people globally and over 3 million in the U.S. as of Wednesday, according to official figures collated by Johns Hopkins University\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Center for Systems Science and Engineering. The disease had claimed at least 545,980 lives worldwide and 131,960 in the U.S. While COVID-19\u00e2\u0080\u0099s progress has slowed in New York, where most cases in the U.S. are still centered, confirmed coronavirus cases have recently risen in nearly 40 U.S. states. New cases are up 51% in the Virgin Islands, 41% in Florida over the past week, 34% in Idaho, 35% in Montana, 34% in Arizona, and was up 25% in Texas, and 19% in California, according to this tally by the Washington Post. Thus far, New York has had the most deaths from COVID-19 in the U.S. (32,251), followed by New Jersey (15,332), Massachusetts (8,243), Illinois (7,309), Pennsylvania (6,812), California (6,577) and Michigan (6,262). Texas has reported 2,796 deaths. The Dow Jones Industrial Index DJIA, +0.56% \u00c2 and the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% \u00c2 ended higher Wednesday amid a surge of coronavirus in states that have loosened restrictions. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat has happened, I guess understandably, but nonetheless regrettably, is that people took the attitude in some places of either \u00e2\u0080\u0098all or none,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Fauci told CNN in an another one-on-one interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEither you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re locked down, or you just let it fly, and you just ignore many of the guidelines of physical distancing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a recipe for disaster,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Fauci told the cable network. Fauci said America needs to balance the needs of the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic and public health. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe do need to open up again, no doubt about it, we want to get the economy back, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to do it in a measured way, and now we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing the consequence of community spread.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Also see:Florida records 10,000 new coronavirus cases \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the largest daily surge since the pandemic began Community spread, Fauci added, is insidious. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt makes it extremely problematic to do efficient contact tracing, because most of the people who are infected don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even know they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re infected. So how do you do contact tracing when someone doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any symptoms?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Fauci said the U.S. government has not been doing well with contact tracing, the process of tracing people who have been in contact with someone who has the virus, and instructing them to stay home for 14 days. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing very well, for a number of reasons, and not all of which is the fault of the system.\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Elizabeth Cohen, who interviewed Fauci for CNN T, -1.01% The public also needs to be more cooperative, he said. Some people close to the border are reluctant to give names to authorities to trace, while other names that are given to health authorities \u00e2\u0080\u009care lost in the shuffle. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very, very difficult situation. That we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to do better on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In states where coronavirus spread is surging, like Arizona, Texas, Florida and California, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009c20% to 40% of the people who are infected don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any symptoms, so the standard, classic paradigm of identification, isolation, contact tracing doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work no matter how good you are.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098Twenty percent to 40% of the people who are infected don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any symptoms, so the standard, classic paradigm of identification, isolation, contact tracing doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work no matter how good you are, because you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know who you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re tracing.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Anthony Fauci, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Fauci previously said that was the single biggest threat and surprise about COVID-19. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been dealing with viral outbreaks for the last 40 years. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never seen a single virus \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that is, one pathogen \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have a range where 20% to 40% of the people have no symptoms,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said last week during a House Committee on Energy and Commerce hearing on the Trump administration's response to the novel coronavirus pandemic. The coronavirus pandemic is \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot even close to being over,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to the head of the World Health Organization, and the worst is still to come, in what was a grim assessment of the state of affairs some six months after the first cases were reported in China. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSix months ago, none of us could have imagined how our world \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and our lives \u00e2\u0080\u0094 would be thrown into turmoil by this new virus,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters at a news briefing last week. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe pandemic has brought out the best and the worst of humanity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tedros said WHO is sending a team to Wuhan, China next week to work on the virus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s origins. The WHO currently estimates that 16% of people with COVID-19 are asymptomatic and can transmit the coronavirus, while other data show that 40% of coronavirus transmission is due to carriers not displaying symptoms of the illness. As a result, public health officials have advised people to keep a distance of 6 feet from one another. A recent University of California, San Francisco, study found that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a high load of SARS-CoV-2 shedding in the upper respiratory tract, even among pre-symptomatic patients, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich distinguishes it from SARS-CoV-1, where replication occurs mainly in the lower respiratory tract.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Such a viral load makes symptom-based detection of infection less effective in the case of SARS CoV-2, it said. After two months of obfuscation over the efficacy of face masks, during which New York City became the epicenter of the pandemic in the U.S., and one month after the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, U.S. federal authorities said all Americans should, after all, wear face coverings in public settings. Fauci has said he was hopeful that a coronavirus vaccine could be developed by early 2021, but said it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unlikely that a vaccine will deliver 100% immunity; he said the best realistic outcome, based on other vaccines, would be 70% to 75% effective. The measles vaccine, he said, is among the most effective by providing 97% immunity. (This story was updated on July 8.) How COVID-19 is transmitted"}]}
