BJ\u00e2\u0080\u0099s BJ, +1.19% \u00c2 says it now has more than six million paid members. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo put this in perspective, in the past six months, we acquired and retained approximately 18 months\u00e2\u0080\u0099 worth of members,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lee Delaney, BJ\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief executive, on the Thursday earnings call. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis pace, should it continue, would have us experience three years of membership growth in this one transformative year. Not only are new members joining at elevated levels, they skew younger and are more digitally engaged.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Delaney thinks these customers are likely to stick around. To raise that likelihood, the company says it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s paying close attention to consumer behavior and investing in marketing to interact with shoppers.

BJ\u00e2\u0080\u0099s added 32 new vendors for food, paper goods and cleaning supplies, brought in more healthy and organic items and added to the lineup on names like Sony and Puma PUM, -0.07% \u00c2 . Digitally-enabled sales soared 300% over the second quarter, and on Friday the retailer launched curbside pickup at all of its clubs. BJ\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operates 219 clubs and 148 BJ\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Gas locations in 17 states. The membership-only warehouse club chain based in Massachusetts, operates on the East Coast and the states of Ohio and Michigan, but along with its growing membership rolls, BJ\u00e2\u0080\u0099s is also growing its footprint, with a new Michigan club opening in July, two new clubs planned for New York by the end of the fiscal year, and six new clubs next year. BJ\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stock rose 3.6% in Friday trading, and has more than doubled, up 102%, for the year to date. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% \u00c2 is up nearly 6% for 2020 so far.

We think BJ\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remains attractive.\u00e2\u0080\u009d UBS rates BJ\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stock buy and raised its price target by $4 to $50. MKM Partners is much less optimistic, not just about BJ\u00e2\u0080\u0099s but also Costco Wholesale Corp. COST, +1.19% \u00c2 and others in the warehouse retail space. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe COVID-19 disruption benefit has lasted longer than we expected for BJ\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and the sector, but we still believe the traffic will moderate and shopping consolidation will reverse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d wrote BIll Kirk, an executive director at MKM. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSpecific to the warehouse/clubs, we consider the need for bulk shopping to decrease as consumers resume more normal daily activities. We believe decreased bulk shopping and geographic exposure to states re-opening, combine for an emerging headwind for BJ\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\u00e2\u0080\u009d MKM also warns that BJ\u00e2\u0080\u0099s is exposed to competition with Walmart Inc. WMT, +1.00% \u00c2 with locations that overlap in some zip codes and in states that have had challenged reopenings. MKM rates BJ\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stock sell with a $33 price target, up from $30."}]}
