The market saw upbeat economic data over the weekend from China, the world\u2019s biggest importer of crude. Industrial profits in China for May were up 6% from a year earlier, representing the first increase in 2020, official statistics released over the weekend showed. There are also signs of further slowdowns in oil production. \u201cTo sum up the American producers\u2019 standpoint, domestic rig count is down 73% from last year,\u201d so oil has resumed its trend upward, said Raj. Still, \u201cthe greatest spoiler last week was the recovery in U.S. oil production by 500,000 barrels a day,\u201d as reported by the Energy Information Administration, he said. \u201cTraders now fear that at least some of the shut in wells...could quickly spring back and spoil the recent recovery.\u201d West Texas Intermediate crude for August US:CLQ20 rose $1.21, or 3.1%, to settle at $39.70 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, following a 3.4% weekly decline for WTI put in on Friday. Global benchmark Brent oil for August delivery UK:BRNQ20 climbed 69 cents, or 1.7%, at $41.71 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe, after notching a weekly decline of 2.8% on Friday, based on the most-active contract settlements. The August contract expires at the end of Tuesday\u2019s session. Worries about the need to re-implement efforts to prevent the pandemic\u2019s spread, and the likelihood that the moves would slow the recovery in oil demand, have climbed along with cases of the illness. \u201cDemand remains the chief concern for the current market, particularly in the U.S.,\u201d which accounts for nearly 20% of global crude and product demand, said Robbie Fraser, senior commodity analyst at Schneider Electric, in a daily note. U.S. demand has clearly rebounded from a record plunge in March/April, but \u201ca continued rebound is likely to be challenged by the surge of COVID-19 cases in some states.\u201d The U.S. leads the world with a COVID-19 case tally of 2.55 million and death toll of 125,803, more than double the 1.34 million cases and 57,622 deaths recorded in Brazil. Within the U.S., infections have climbed in 32 states over the past 14 days, according to a New York Times tracker, with California, Texas and Florida leading the way. Traders also weighed the potential impact from the bankruptcy filing of Chesapeake Energy Corp. US:CHK on Sunday. The oil- and gas-price rout stoked by the coronavirus pandemic dealt a powerful blow to the U.S. pioneer in a unique oil extraction technique that would come to shift the balance of oil production in the world. \u201cChesapeake was the undisputable master of U.S. shale gas,\u201d wrote Magnus Nysveen, head of analysis at Rystad Energy, in a Monday report. \u201cThe massive financial burden of investing first into the shale gas boom, then its failed attempt to grow a similar strong position on oil plays, have brought the giant to its knees,\u201d he surmised. Separately, Artem Abramov, head of shale research at Rystad, said that \u201ca material portion of the U.S. light oil supply is now controlled by supermajors and large independents with access to the core acreage and strong balance sheets.\u201d Most of these companies \u201ccan gradually adapt even if oil prices of $35-40 WTI stay around for longer.\u201d Back on Nymex, prices for petroleum products were higher along with oil, ahead of the July contract expiration at Tuesday\u2019s settlement. July gasoline US:RBN20 rose 2.7% to $1.1841 a gallon and July heating oil US:HON20 rose 2.6% to $1.1654 a gallon. Read:AAA expects cheapest summer gasoline prices since 2016 August natural gas US:NGQ20 settled at $1.709 per million British thermal units, up 10.7%. \u201cNatural gas markets are responding primarily to weather forecasts, as expectation of warmer days ahead provides a boost to prices that are in multiyear lows,\" said Raj. Futures prices settled on Thursday at $1.482, their lowest since August 1995, according to Dow Jones MarketData."}]}
