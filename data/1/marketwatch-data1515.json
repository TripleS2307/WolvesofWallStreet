The CDC's previous order was set to expire on July 24. Shares of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. NCLH, +2.91% dropped 2.7% ahead of the open, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL, +2.59% shed 2.6% and Carnival Corp. CCL, +0.51% fell 1.1%. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Patrick Scholes said the CDC's extended order \"should not be too much of a surprise,\" as it comes after the last month's announcement by Cruise Lines International Association of an agreement to voluntarily extend the suspension of operations from U.S. ports until Sept. 15. \"We continue to believe that sailings will not resume in quantity in North America until at least 2Q21,\" Scholes wrote in a note to clients. \"Subsequently, we reiterate our belief there will be continued investor disappointment as further starting date delays are announced. Norwegian's stock has plunged 73.3% year to date, Royal's stock has tumbled 59.6% and Carnival shares have slumped 69.0%, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% has eased 0.5%."}]}
