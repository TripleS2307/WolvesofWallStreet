Officials are unhappy with a proposal to monitor study subjects in trials for side effects for two months after being vaccinated, the people said. The White House has been pushing for the FDA to come up with a vaccine quickly and preferably before the November election, raising concerns it will be rushed through without observing proper safety protocols. Among the White House officials raising concerns were chief of staff Mark Meadows and some high-ranking aides in the Office of Management and Budget, one person said. A White House spokesperson declined to comment to the newspaper."}]}
