Thomas Barkin, chief of one of 12 regional branches of the central bank, sounded an alarm at a \u00e2\u0080\u009cdigital town hall\u00e2\u0080\u009d held on Tuesday by the Center for Regional Economic Competitiveness. Senior Fed officials have become increasingly alarmed by the standoff among Democrats and Republicans over the size and scope of the next financial aid package, including an extension of federal unemployment benefits. Normally very reticent to give advice to Congress, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been relatively open in their views that the economy needs more help from Washington. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans called the impasse \u00e2\u0080\u009can unfortunate development\u00e2\u0080\u009d in an interview Sunday on CBS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cFace the Nation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnother support package is really, in my opinion, important,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Evans said. Barkin has been similarly outspoken. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s said that what initially seemed like an economic pothole has turned into a sinkhole. Without the right stimulus, he said Tuesday, the economy could suffer a relapse. Read: The economy took another body blow from Covid-19 in July. Just how bad was it? In an attempted end-run around Democrats, President Trump over the weekend signed a series of executive orders that aim to protect renters, student borrowers and the unemployed. Included in his orders was an extension of federal unemployment benefits at a reduce rate of $300 from an original $600. Democrats, some Republicans and many economists say that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not enough. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unclear if the parties will resume negotiations. Lower unemployment benefits would especially hurt blue-collar workers, Barkin said, while more economic uncertainty could deter white-collar employees who feel more secure in their jobs from spending extra money. Even if a vaccine is developed, Barkin suggested the labor market could show visible scars for quite some time, a warning that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been echoed on Wall Street.
