Ron Johnson was facing criticism from Democrats that his investigation of presidential candidate Joe Biden and Ukraine was politically motivated and advancing Russian interests. But the stark warning that Russia is working to denigrate the Democratic presidential candidate adds to questions about the probe by Johnson\u2019s Senate committee and whether it is mimicking, even indirectly, Russian efforts and amplifying its propaganda. The investigation is unfolding as the country, months removed from an impeachment case that had centered on Ukraine, is dealing with a pandemic and confronting the issue of racial injustice. Yet allegations about Biden and Ukraine remain a popular topic in conservative circles, pushed by Russian media and addressed regularly by President Donald Trump and other Republicans as a potential path toward energizing his supporters. Johnson\u2019s own interest in the topic, from his perch as chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, has drawn concerns during a presidential election that U.S. intelligence officials warn is ripe for foreign disinformation. \u201cParticularly as a public official and somebody who\u2019s responsible for keeping the country safe, you should always be suspicious of narratives that are trying to sort of damage or target the electoral process in your country,\u201d said former CIA officer Cindy Otis, a foreign disinformation expert and vice president of analysis at Alethea Group. \u201cYou should always be suspicious of narratives that foreign countries are pumping out.\u201d The intelligence assessment has put Johnson on the defensive, with the Wisconsin Republican issuing a 5,000-word open letter Monday in which he laid out what he said was the basis for scrutinizing both the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation and the dealings of Biden and his son Hunter with Ukraine. See:Wisconsin lawmaker\u2019s Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee is one of multiple Republican-led Senate panels scrutinizing the FBI\u2019s investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., speaks to Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., before a Senate Foreign Relations committee hearing last month. Associated Press In an interview Wednesday, Johnson said his investigation was rooted in facts, not Russian propaganda, and that the \u201cAmerican people deserve the truth\u201d about his probe and what he said were its damning findings. He said he hoped to get the information out, in report form, before November\u2019s vote. Johnson said that though he was sensitive to the threat of Russian interference, he was not responsible for peddling any disinformation in his investigation and described as \u201ccompletely false\u201d the idea that he is pushing foreign propaganda. \u201cI completely reject this entire narrative, this coordinated attack on me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous if it weren\u2019t so serious.\u201d The statement last Friday from William Evanina, the government\u2019s top counterintelligence official, made no reference to Johnson in particular but did allude to foreign efforts to smear Biden that in some ways parallel Johnson\u2019s own probe. That includes the work of Andrii Derkach, a member of Ukraine\u2019s parliament and 1993 graduate of a Russian spy academy, who has disclosed leaked recordings of Biden meant to cast the candidate in a negative light. Johnson suggested he was not willing to unequivocally trust the assessment without seeing the underlying intelligence. In his open letter, he distanced himself from Derkach, saying he had never received any information from him and \u201calmost all of the documents we are seeking and will make public are from U.S. sources.\u201d But, Otis said, given how easily Russia launders its information, and how swiftly material originating in Russia can get picked up and spread to English-language forums, \u201cit is very difficult to peel back the origination point for this stuff, even with the aid of having technology on our side.\u201d Johnson\u2019s preoccupation with Biden has dismayed Democrats on the committee who view it as a politically motivated distraction at a time when the panel, which oversees the response to national disasters, should be focused on the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cAt this moment when Americans need us to work together, this extremely partisan investigation is pulling us apart,\u201d Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan, the committee\u2019s top Democrat, said at a May 20 meeting at which the panel authorized a subpoena related to the Biden investigation. Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris of California, now Biden\u2019s running mate, at the same session accused Johnson of shirking his oversight responsibilities related to the pandemic response in favor of forcing a vote on \u201ca purely political matter that will do absolutely nothing for those at risk of contracting COVID-19.\u201d Johnson said those attacks were unfair because his committee has taken up multiple pandemic-related bills and devoted most of its time to the outbreak. Saying that \u201ca couple of investigators\u201d were devoted to the Ukraine probe, he added, \u201cWe literally can chew gum and walk at the same time.\u201d Democrats have repeatedly sounded the alarm about the committee\u2019s work, including by requesting briefings from law enforcement and intelligence officials, given the extent of Russia\u2019s own interest in pushing the anti-Biden narrative. Central to that narrative are allegations that Hunter Biden used his influence with his father to aid a Ukrainian natural gas company, Burisma, and that Joe Biden, as vice president, pressured the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor, who had led an investigation into Burisma. Hunter Biden, with no expertise in the country or the natural gas industry, had joined the Burisma board in 2014 during the latter part of his father\u2019s tenure in the Obama administration. Biden has said he never speaks to his son about his overseas business dealings. His position on Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor, who was seen by critics as soft on corruption, was the official position of the U.S. government and was also supported by other Western governments and many in Ukraine. Evanina said Russia disapproved of Biden because of his role in shaping Obama administration policies supporting Ukraine and opposing Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Though the allegations of corruption have not been substantiated, they have long been of interest to Trump. His request last year to Ukraine\u2019s president that he announce an investigation of Burisma and the Bidens, tying it to U.S. support of the fledgling democracy, formed the basis of the impeachment case against him. In the Senate, the Johnson-led investigation has proceeded this election year, but with some delay. In May, the committee authorized a subpoena for Blue Star Strategies, a lobbying firm that was a consultant to Burisma. But just months earlier, Johnson postponed a vote on a subpoena to interview and obtain documents from Andrii Telizhenko, a consultant to Blue Star, \u201cout of an abundance of caution\u201d after committee staff received a classified briefing. Johnson, meanwhile, announced this week a subpoena for the FBI for documents in its investigation into the Trump campaign and Russia. His committee isn\u2019t the only one undertaking such a probe. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a Trump ally and chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has for months scrutinized the Russia investigation. He has released a series of previously secret documents, most targeting the legitimacy of a dossier of research on Trump\u2019s ties to Russia compiled by a British ex-spy that was financed by a conservative organization and later, in the run-up to the 2016 general election, Democrats."}]}
