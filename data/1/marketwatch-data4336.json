The IMF sees a global economic contraction of 4.9%, almost two percentage points lower than three months ago. If realized, that would be the worst downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s, far worse than the financial crisis of 2008-2010. In January, before COVID-19 had spread, the IMF had projected 3.3% global economic growth this year. \u201cWe are definitely not out of the woods. We have not escaped the great lockdown,\u201d said Gita Gopinath, the IMF\u2019s chief economist, at a press briefing. Read:Coronavirus tally: Global cases of COVID-19 at 9.3 million, 477,807 deaths \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a more negative impact on activity in the first half of 2020 than anticipated and the recovery is projected to be more gradual than previously forecast,\u201d the IMF said. In 2021, global growth is expected to rebound to a 5.4% growth rate, down 0.4 percentage points from the April forecast. The recovery is expected to be \u201csluggish\u201d with the level of gross domestic product still about 6.5 percentage points lower than the pre-COVID-19 projections of January. The downturn is expected to hit bottom in the April-June quarter this year and then start to recover gradually. The IMF\u2019s projected recovery looks like the Nike swoosh. This pandemic has led to a demand shock as businesses and households cut back spending. Globally, business lockdowns were at their most intense through mid-May but activity remains low compared to pre-coronavirus pandemic levels. For the U.S., the IMF cut its forecast for 2020 to negative 8%, which is 2.1% lower than in April. Growth is expected to rise to 4.5% in 2021. China is the only major economy still expected to experience economic growth this year. The IMF cut growth forecasts for all regions and types of economies in 2020.

It called for global efforts to help countries facing a health crisis and external funding shortfalls.

Inflation pressures remains muted. Progress on poverty reduction is expected to be reversed. Of the 2 billion informally employed workers worldwide, the International Labour Organization estimates that close to 80% have been affected. Full-time workers also suffered steep job losses \u2014 roughly 130 million full-time jobs were lost in the first quarter worldwide and 300 million in the second quarter, the ILO said. There is a risk that financial conditions might tighten more than assumed as \u201cthe extent of the recent rebound in financial-market sentiment appears disconnected from shifts in underlying economic prospects,\u201d the IMF said. The IMF said that $10.7 trillion in fiscal measures have been announced worldwide to fight the pandemic. \u201cMore will be needed. And many countries are doing a lot already,\u201d Gopinath said. As a result, global public debt is expected to reach an all-time high, exceeding 101% of GDP in 2020-21. That\u2019s 19 percentage points above a year ago. Gopinath said it was wrong to think governments have no constraints on debt. \u201cWe are in this world because of very strong monetary policy frameworks and fiscal frameworks that have helped countries be able to borrow at very low rates but if we give up on that, we can certainly move to a different state of the world where borrowing costs can go up quite dramatically for countries,\u201d she said. The IMF urged nations to avoid a repeat of this \u201ccatastrophe\u201d by building global stockpiles of health supplies and protective equipment."}]}
