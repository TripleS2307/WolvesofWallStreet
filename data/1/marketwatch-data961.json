Instead, its signature features, from the enormous helium balloon characters to the dance performances, will be pretaped in Manhattan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Herald Square over two days and broadcast on Thanksgiving morning, Nov. 26, as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cspecial presentation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Macy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s M, -0.95% \u00c2 said.\u00c2 Sixty-foot balloons, the parade\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main attraction, were nearly its downfall last year, when dangerous winds threatened to rip the floating giants from the hands of volunteers. This year, each colossus will be rigged to a handful of approved vehicles, cutting out the need for the usual 80-100 handlers per balloon, the company said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile it will certainly look different in execution, this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Macy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Parade celebration will once again serve its historical purpose \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to bring joy into the hearts of millions across the nation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Susan Tercero, executive producer of Macy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Thanksgiving Day Parade on Monday.

All high school and college marching band performances are canceled, and the event will exclude performers under 18 years old, the company said in its announcement.\u00c2 Also see: \u00e2\u0080\u0098It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a five-alarm fire, a 100-year fiscal tsunami\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 N.Y. Transit boss wants subway riders to come back The parade, which began in 1924, has grown from a modest gathering of Macy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s employees in costumes and floats to a massive multimillion-dollar event with thousands of volunteers and performers.
