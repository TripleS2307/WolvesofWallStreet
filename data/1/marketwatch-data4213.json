The maker of network services, videoconferencing tools and security software reported fourth-quarter net income of $2.64 billion, or 62 cents a share, as revenue declined 9% to $12.15 billion from $13.4 billion in the year-ago period. After adjusting for stock compensation and other effects, Cisco reported earnings of 80 cents a share, down slightly from 83 cents a share a year ago. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had projected adjusted earnings of 65 cents a share on revenue of $12.09 billion on average, though those expectations have come down significantly since COVID-19 began to spread across the globe. Analysts expected adjusted earnings of 75 cents a share on sales of $13.14 billion at the end of 2019. First-quarter adjusted earnings guidance of 69 cents to 71 cents fell short of the 75 cents modeled by FactSet analysts. Cisco also warned that Q1 revenue will decline 9% to 11% year-over-year. The fourth-quarter results, announced after the market\u00e2\u0080\u0099s close Wednesday, sent Cisco CSCO, +0.15% \u00c2 shares down more than 6% in after-hours trading. The were down about 7% premarket Thursday. Cisco stock is flat in 2020, while the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% \u00c2 has climbed 4.6%. Since March 12, however, Cisco shares have jumped 45%. In a conference call Wednesday afternoon, Cisco announced that CFO Kelly Kramer will retire from the company once a replacement is found. In an interview after the call ended, Kramer told MarketWatch that her departure had \u00e2\u0080\u009cnothing to do with the company, I love Cisco.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kramer instead said \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just time\u00e2\u0080\u009d after 30 years in the business and six years as Cisco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CFO, and that she looks forward to \u00e2\u0080\u009cmore board work and investing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kramer won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be the only Cisco employee retiring in this fiscal year. Cisco said it would undergo a $1 billion cost reduction \u00e2\u0080\u009cover the next few quarters\u00e2\u0080\u009d by \u00e2\u0080\u009crebalancing its R&D investments\u00e2\u0080\u009d on several areas that include cloud security and automation in the enterprise, leading to speculation of job cuts from Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. Kramer admitted in the interview with MarketWatch that the first part of those cuts will be voluntary retirement offerings for Cisco employees. After the company figures out how much they can cut through those efforts, decisions will be made about other moves to get up to the $1 billion figure, she said. Cisco is both benefiting and suffering in the age of coronavirus: Hardware sales are being squeezed during the pandemic, while demand for Cisco tools and services that aid remote work, such as Webex, has surged. Executives pointed out Wednesday that the majority of Cisco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revenue \u00e2\u0080\u0094 51% \u00e2\u0080\u0094 came from software and services in the 2020 fiscal year, the first time they have has passed that mark. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy the end of fiscal 2020, we achieved our goal of more than half of our revenue coming from software and services, and this strategy continues to resonate with customers as they digitize their organizations,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cisco Chief Executive Chuck Robbins said in a statement announcing the results. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs we focus on the future, we are rebalancing our R&D investments to focus on new areas so we can continue to offer customers the best, most relevant technology in simpler, more easily consumable ways.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cisco finds itself in a gauzy situation during the pandemic: It is dominant across network equipment markets but faces pressure from unpredictable service-provider and enterprise spending; COVID-19 and the work-from-home movement have put pressure on high-margin campus product groups; and the recent entry of Arista Networks Inc. ANET, +2.30% \u00c2 and Juniper Networks Inc. JNPR, +0.08% \u00c2 into campus switching and WLAN pose threats. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are cognizant that Cisco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top line is challenged in the near to medium term from macro headwinds, but diversification, opex [operating expense] discipline and cash flow flexibility afford it the ability to show greater resilience on the earnings line,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Morgan Stanley analyst Meta Marshall, said in July 9 note that upgraded Cisco shares to overweight and maintained a price target of $54.
