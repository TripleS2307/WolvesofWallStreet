Forescout shares surged 15% to $28.89 in recent trading. Forescout said Advent will acquire it for $29 a share, putting an end to a lawsuit that arose when it looked like the original deal was falling apart. Back in February, Forescout agreed to be taken private by Advent for $33 a share, or $1.9 billion, but by May, Forescout said the deal was being delayed. Under the new agreement, Advent will begin a tender offer for Forescout shares on or before July 20 with the deal expected to close in the third quarter."}]}
