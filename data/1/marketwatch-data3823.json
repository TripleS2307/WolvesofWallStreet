The goal was set alongside the release of the company\u2019s 2019 Workforce Diversity report, a breakdown of the racial and gender composition at the retailer. The report found that more than half of the company\u2019s workforce is composed of people color, including 15% who are Black and 25% who are Latinx. Meanwhile, the company\u2019s leadership team is 8% each Black, Latinx and Asian, with the remainder white. And 15% of Target\u2019s board is Black, 31% is Latinx and 54% is white. \u201cWe know that having a diverse workforce and inclusive environment not only creates a stronger team, but also provides the perspectives we need to create the products, services, experiences and messages our guests expect,\u201d said Melissa Kremer, Target\u2019s TGT, +1.14% chief human resources officer, in a statement.

This latest report comes amid increased focus on diversity at companies and groups across a wide spectrum of industries. This week, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the group that awards the Oscars, said best picture nominees will have to meet a standard for diversity both on screen and off to be eligible for the award. Target\u2019s Workforce Diversity report also found that more than half of its staff, 58%, are women, while 42% of the company\u2019s leadership team is composed of women. To achieve its latest diversity goal, Target will take steps including developing programs to hire and retain Black workers in areas where they are least represented, including technology and merchandising; increasing mentors and sponsorships for Black workers; and conducting anti-racist training.
