August gold rose $24.90, or 1.3%, to settle at $1,890 an ounce on Comex Thursday, after trading as high as $1,897.70. The contract ended just short of the most-active contract settlement record of $1,891.90 from August 22, 2011, based on records going back to November 1984, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The record most-active intraday level stands at $1,923.70 an ounce from Sept. 6, 2011. However, the front-month July gold contract US:GCN20, which trades on significantly lower volume, settled at $1,889.10 on Thursday, up $25, or 1.3%, for the session. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a record for the front-month contracts, based on data going back to 1975. Silver prices, meanwhile, also recently rallied to their highest settlement since 2013, with the September silver US:SIU20 contract on Wednesday settling at $23.144 an ounce. Gold\u00e2\u0080\u0099s upward momentum is \u00e2\u0080\u009ccaused by perfect storm of pandemic headlines, benign dollars and interest rates, as global economic stimulus grows,\u00e2\u0080\u009d George Gero, managing director at RBC Wealth Management, told MarketWatch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis may last longer than usual cycles\u00e2\u0080\u009d as the pandemic casts a shadow on Europe, South America, the Far East, as well as the U.S. Contributing to gold\u00e2\u0080\u0099s haven appeal are escalating tensions between China and the U.S., the upcoming U.S. election, worries about an increase in debts from continuing stimulus, and unrest everywhere, said Gero. Gold prices have climbed by around 50% since the summer of 2018, when the metal bottomed under $1,200 an ounce, said Adrian Ash, director of research at BullionVault. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the fastest two-year gain since New Year 2012, he said. The yellow metal also has climbed around $400 an ounce from March\u00e2\u0080\u0099s COVID-19 crash, \u00e2\u0080\u009cits steepest 17-week gain since the very tops of September 2011 and before that January 1980,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ash, adding that trading volumes on BullionVault, an online platform for physical precious metals, reached $28.9 million, which was the third busiest day ever, after March 17 when the COVID crisis really broke, and June 24, 2016, the day of the U.K.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Brexit referendum result. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHot money\u00e2\u0080\u0099s finally joined in,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ash. That said, analysts warned that gold could soon see a correction. Prices could move lower \u00e2\u0080\u009con profit taking,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Norman. At the same time, the stock market is \u00e2\u0080\u009clooking disconnected from the real economy and a sell off could see margin calls again like we saw\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the first quarter, prompting traders to sell gold to cover those margins. Gero voiced caution as well. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNext week, options expirations on Comex, with in the money options becoming futures contracts needing cash margin, could bring traders profit taking\u00e2\u0080\u009d in gold, he said. Even if there was a pullback in gold prices, however, Norman said \u00e2\u0080\u009call that would do is provide a fresh buying opportunity\u00e2\u0080\u00a6so that window could close quite quickly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}]}
