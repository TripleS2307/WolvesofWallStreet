On Thursday, market attention will turn to the Jackson Hole conference held every year by the Kansas City Federal Reserve, with the event this time being held online rather than in the mountains, and the focus being how tolerant Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will say the central bank will be toward inflation. Michael Brown, senior market analyst at currency card provider Caxton, says markets at the moment are simply riding a wave of momentum. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese quiet summer markets appear to have brought out the worst in some market observers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with endless talk about dismal breadth, how medical optimism is fueling the risk rally, or even how a mere phone call between U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators has given us a few more points of upside,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he writes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor anyone who possesses an ounce of reason, it is clear that what the market is doing is simply following the path of least resistance. Naturally, in markets trading on near nonexistent volumes, overflowing with unprecedented amounts of stimulus, we are going to head higher, all else equal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To spark a pullback, there would have to be a negative catalyst \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and Brown doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect one from the coronavirus pandemic. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe pandemic is now a \u00e2\u0080\u0098known known\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to investors and, barring a more significant second wave in the winter, it is difficult to envisage the market being spooked by the virus itself in a similar manner to March. Furthermore, a return to nationwide lockdowns is off the table, and the \u00e2\u0080\u0098central bank put\u00e2\u0080\u0099 remains alive and well. It is, therefore, no surprise to see that the market\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sensitivity to news about infectious diseases has been in decline since March, and is now not far from its pre-pandemic levels,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he writes. That catalyst could be anything from the U.S. political landscape, to events in Belarus, to another \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrue black swan event,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.
