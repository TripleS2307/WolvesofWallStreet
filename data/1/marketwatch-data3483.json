Trump is so far behind, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s such a buffoon, he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a chance. Sound familiar? It should, because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what most people were saying back in the summer of 2016. How\u00e2\u0080\u0099d that work out? Now the New York/Washington/Left Coast elites are at it again. Stick a fork in the Donald, they cackle \u00e2\u0080\u0094 he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s done! Is it different this time? Or can Trump shock the world again? There are tons of reasons why Trump should not win. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s failed on most of his big promises. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no wall. The national debt, which he vowed to eliminate (through trade deals) has exploded. Meantime, Iran and North Korea are more dangerous than ever. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the Mount Everest of dishonesty. Not only has he not drained Washington\u00e2\u0080\u0099s swamp as promised, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s made it swampier than ever. Numerous associates have been indicted, convicted, pled guilty, tossed in the can, abused the public trust, and more. Trump said he only hires \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe very best,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and this is what we get? \u00e2\u0080\u0098I really don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care do U?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 But guess what? Millions of Americans don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to care. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always known that Trump was a stooge. Here are three takeaways from 2016 exit polls conducted by CNN: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Just 1 in 3 thought Trump was honest and trustworthy \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Less than 2 in 5 had a favorable opinion of him \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Barely a third \u00e2\u0080\u0094 35% \u00e2\u0080\u0094 said he had the right temperament for the job And he still got 63 million votes! This says as much about the American electorate as it does about Trump. Lots of Trumpers know the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a jerk. They know he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rude, crude, and embarrasses himself on Twitter. And yet they say he gets stuff done. He got tax cuts, two Supreme Court justices, and (through June 1) nearly 200 of his appointees have been put on the federal bench. Trump could lose in November but his mark on American society will endure well into mid-century through these judges. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s base loves him for these things, and most of them\u00e2\u0080\u0094but not all\u00e2\u0080\u0094will vote for him again. Narrow path to re-election As Trump and four other presidents have shown, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to win the popular vote to win the presidency. He won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t win it this year, either. The question: Can he win the Electoral College? The president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s path has narrowed considerably. According to the well-regarded Crystal Ball\u00e2\u0080\u0094put out by the University of Virginia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Center for Politics\u00e2\u0080\u0094Joe Biden, soon to be coronated as the Democratic nominee, has 268 \u00e2\u0080\u009csafe, likely, or leaning\u00e2\u0080\u009d electoral votes, while Trump has 204. There are only four states, the Crystal Ball says, that remain true toss ups: Florida, North Carolina, Arizona and Wisconsin. Together, they have 65 electoral votes. The current prediction for the 2020 presidential election from Larry Sabato's Crystal Ball shows Democrat Joe Biden with a big but not insurmountable lead over President Donald Trump. Center for Politics Biden only needs one of these, and leads in all four by an average of 3.8 points (median 5.1) But Trump needs them all, the poker equivalent of drawing an inside straight. Not impossible, but highly improbable. That would get him to 269, enough to win. There is also the oddity of two states\u00e2\u0080\u0094Maine and Nebraska\u00e2\u0080\u0094which do not allocate their electoral votes in winner-take-all fashion. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too complicated to explain here, other than to say a single electoral vote in say, Maine, could tip the entire election. Why can a candidate win with 269 and not 270? Because an Electoral College tie (extremely unlikely) would be decided by the incoming House of Representatives, with each state delegation getting one vote. Right now, this favors Republicans. Even though they have fewer House seats overall, the GOP controls 26 state delegations to the Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 23 (Pennsylvania is evenly divided). So if it came down to a House vote, whichever party controlled the most state delegations in the new Congress would pick the president. The Democrats would have to wrest control of at least three more state delegations, and they could do just that. Making all this even more bizarre: the Senate would pick the vice president. Right now the GOP controls the Senate. What if one party picked the president and another the vice president? It simply doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get any stranger than this. But again, this is all quite unlikely. Biden appears to be in the driver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seat as we approach the four-month mark. So what can Trump do to get there? The economy, the virus, or? To state the obvious: A coronavirus cure would help (not that he would have anything to do with it), as would clear evidence that the economy is on the mend. But first-quarter gross domestic product was -5.0%. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bad, but the second quarter\u00e2\u0080\u0094which (so far) saw the worst of the coronavirus\u00e2\u0080\u0094looks downright apocalyptic: perhaps -39.5%, according to an estimate issued last week by the Atlanta Federal Reserve. The third quarter, which begins Wednesday, could be great\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the first reading on that could mean good news for Trump just days before the election. On the other hand, with the virus now ravaging big states like Texas and Florida, this is far from certain. Trump can hope that voters don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t blame him for the economic shutdown. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blames the governors, which is largely true, but if that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the case, then the president is throwing two swing-state Republicans under the bus: Florida\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ron DeSantis and Arizona\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Doug Ducey. The president could also try to convince voters that his tariffs and trade wars have been a good thing. But tariff is just another word for taxes on the end user, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plenty of data that adds to the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vulnerability. Go dirty Trump also has another, often ignored disadvantage. Many of his 2016 voters weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so much voting for him as they were voting against Hillary Clinton. The percentage of Americans who have a \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery negative\u00e2\u0080\u009d view of Biden is about 25%, whereas Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at this point in 2016 was about 42%. Trump has failed to paint \u00e2\u0080\u009cSleepy Joe\u00e2\u0080\u009d as a monster the way he did \u00e2\u0080\u009cCrooked Hillary,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and I suspect he won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to. I think the best path for Trump, sadly, may be to do what he does best: go dirty. He has admitted that he can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t win with mail-in balloting, so what does Trump (who votes by mail himself) do? He claims it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rife with fraud. This is a huge lie. There have also been state-level efforts to purge voter rolls and reduce the number of polling places, measures that disproportionately hurt minority voters. Trump squawked that 2016 was rigged (until he won), and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re beginning to hear similar talk again. And even though Trump seems to think that the coronavirus has gone away, the fact is it could cause problems like understaffed polling places, leading to long lines and chaos."}]}
