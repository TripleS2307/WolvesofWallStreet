Casual-dining brands include Darden Restaurants Inc.\u2019s DRI, -1.34% Olive Garden chain and Dine Brands Inc.\u2019s DIN, +4.14% Applebee\u2019s and IHOP brands. The U.S. has now tallied 2.89 million cases of COVID-19, the highest in the world. U.S. deaths from the pandemic are nearly 130,000. Over the past two weeks, the number of cases in the U.S. has climbed in 38 states, with Florida, Idaho and Montana in the lead.

Other restaurant categories saw increases, including quick-service restaurants like McDonald\u2019s Corp. MCD, -0.43% and Wendy\u2019s Inc. WEN, +2.20% (up 7% versus a 9% rise the previous week) and coffee vendors such as Starbucks Corp. SBUX, +0.53% and Dunkin\u2019 Brands Inc. DNKN, +1.26% (up 2% compared with a 7% rise the week before). These sorts of restaurants do a good deal of their business via drive-through and takeaway. \u201cLower casual-dining restaurant ticket is consistent with more customers avoiding eating at restaurants due to the spike in COVID cases in states/cities that recently reopened, as dine-in occasions have higher attach rates for beverages and desserts,\u201d the Bernstein report said. Immediately before the most recent spike, UBS analysts highlighted shifting restaurant sales as dining rooms reopened. After speaking with franchisees across fast-food, casual-dining and fast-casual chains, analysts said the average check at fast-food restaurants was starting to \u201cnormalize,\u201d something that even increased traffic hadn\u2019t been able to offset. \u201cLate-night sales are gradually returning, but sales at dinner have slowed, particularly in markets with a higher percentage of reopened casual-dining rooms,\u201d the report said. Continued growth in casual dining would be based on, among other factors, the desire to eat out at a restaurant and capacity limitations imposed by state and local authorities, according to the June 24 UBS report. Things have changed over the past two weeks. One restaurant sector that continues to grow is pizza, with Bernstein data showing 43% spending growth during the most recent week, versus 39% the previous week. Pizza chains Papa John\u2019s International Inc. PZZA, -1.18% and Domino\u2019s Pizza Inc. DPZ, -2.50% are poised to gain even more as the pandemic continues. These chains were well-established for digital ordering and home delivery even before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, and added contactless delivery after the outbreak.

Kalinowski says mom-and-pop pizza shops will suffer because they get a lot of their business from a dine-in crowd. Throughout the pandemic, MKM Partners analysts say Domino\u2019s and Papa John\u2019s will continue to see solid results. \u201cWe believe their solid results have helped management remain focused on go-forward strategies (including menu initiatives), which could continue to see the brands generate strong sales results, despite the growing access to dine-in options,\u201d Brett Levy, MKM executive director, wrote. Ease, convenience and value will continue to work in favor of both pizza chains.
