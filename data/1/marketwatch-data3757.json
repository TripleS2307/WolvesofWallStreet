Azerbaijan's Defense Ministry via AP YEREVAN, Armenia \u2014 Armenian and Azerbaijani forces fought over the separatist region of Nagorno-Karabakh for a second day Monday, with both sides blaming each other for resuming the attacks that reportedly killed and wounded dozens as the decades-old conflict has reignited. The Azerbaijani Defense Ministry claimed Armenian forces shelled the town of Tartar, while Armenian officials said the fighting continued overnight and Baku resumed \u201coffensive operations\u201d in the morning. Azerbaijani military officials told the Interfax news agency that over 550 Armenian troops have been \u201cdestroyed (including those wounded)\u201d in a claim that Armenia denied. According to officials in the predominantly Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, 58 servicemen on their side have been killed so far.

About 200 troops have been wounded, but many were only slightly hurt and have returned to action, the Armenian Defense Ministry said. Azerbaijani authorities said nine civilians were killed and 32 wounded on their side. Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said Sunday there were losses among Baku\u2019s forces, too, but he didn\u2019t elaborate. The heavy fighting broke out Sunday in the region that lies within Azerbaijan but has been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by the Yerevan government since 1994 at the end of a separatist war. Azerbaijan said it destroyed two Armenian tanks, and Nagorno-Karabakh\u2019s Defense Ministry reported that Baku \u201clost 10 armored vehicles in a tank battle.\u201d The Armenian Defense Ministry said that, while the fighting continued, \u201call offensives of the Azerbaijani Armed Forces were successfully suppressed, the enemy was thrown back\u201d and suffered losses. Nagorno-Karabakh \u2014 a region in the Caucasus Mountains about 1,700 square miles or about the size of the U.S. state of Delaware \u2014 is 30 miles from the Armenian border. Soldiers backed by Armenia also occupy some Azerbaijani territory outside the region. The European Union urged both sides to stop fighting and return to the negotiating table, following similar calls by Iran, Russia, France and the United States. \u201cWe hope and we urge everyone to everything they can in order to prevent an all-out war from breaking out, because this is the last thing the region needs,\u201d European Commission spokesman Peter Stano said in Brussels. \u201cThere is no military solution to this conflict.\u201d Five European countries \u2014 Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany and the United Kingdom \u2014 asked for a closed-door meeting of the U.N. Security Council on the escalating conflict on Tuesday. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres spoke to both Aliyev and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian and called for \u201can immediate stop to the fighting, a de-escalation of tensions and a return to meaningful negotiations without preconditions or delay,\u201d spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the situation \u201cis a cause for concern for Moscow and other countries.\u201d \u201cWe believe that the hostilities should be immediately ended,\u201d Peskov said, adding that the process of resolving the conflict should shift into \u201ca politico-diplomatic\u201d dimension. Armenia\u2019s Foreign Ministry accused Turkey, which sides with Azerbaijan in the conflict, of supporting \u201cthis aggression.\u201d \u201cTurkish military experts are fighting side by side with Azerbaijan, who are using Turkish weapons, including UAVs and warplanes,\u201d the ministry said. The situation \u201cclearly indicates\u201d that people in Nagorno-Karabakh are fighting against \u201ca Turkish-Azerbaijani alliance,\u201d the statement said. Both Armenia and Turkey accused each other of recruiting foreign mercenaries. Omer Celik, spokesman for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s ruling party, denied reports that Turkey had sent arms or foreign fighters to Azerbaijan. \u201cArmenia is disturbed by Turkey\u2019s solidarity with Azerbaijan and is producing lies against Turkey,\u201d Celik tweeted. Erdogan reiterated Turkey\u2019s support for Azerbaijan and said Armenia\u2019s immediate withdrawal from the region was the only way to ensure peace. \u201cAll other impositions and threats will not only be unjust and unlawful, but will continue to indulge Armenia,\u201d he said. Erdogan criticized France, the U.S. and Russia \u2014 the three chairs of the so-called Minsk group that was set up in 1992 to resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict \u2014 saying they had failed to resolve the issue for 30 years. \u201cThey have done their best not to solve this issue. And now they come and counsel and issue threats. They say \u2018is Turkey here, is the Turkish military here?\u2019\u201d Erdogan said. \u201cWhose lands were occupied? Azerbaijan\u2019s lands. \u2026 Nobody asks for (Armenia) to account. Azerbaijan has been forced to take the matters into its own hands,\u201d he added."}]}
