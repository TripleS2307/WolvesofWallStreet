A flurry of activity by Slack Technologies Inc. WORK, +3.36% , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +2.48% , and Zoom Video Communications Inc. ZM, +2.89% on Wednesday and Tuesday underscores the aggressive actions they\u2019re willing to take to capitalize on tech\u2019s hottest market: The forced migration of millions of employees to work from home accelerated what was already a fledgling business. In short order, Slack made a rare acquisition, Microsoft Teams dressed up its Teams platform, and Zoom is diving into the hardware business.

Slack started the day with just the sixth acquisition in its 11-year history. For an undisclosed sum, it snapped up Rimeto, a maker of enterprise-directory software to offer a \u201csearchable directory, automatically integrating information from across your company to deliver rich profiles of every employee, their skills, experience, and current projects.\u201d Rimeto will run as a stand-alone app, extending Slack\u2019s horizontal strategy. Expect more, much more, Slack Chief Executive Stewart Butterfield told MarketWatch. He said Slack, flush with cash after raising $1.4 billion, is likely to step up purchases of startups. The news sent Slack shares soaring 8% in trading Wednesday. Several hours later, Microsoft \u2014 which has added customers by the millions in an unrelenting digital land grab \u2014 unveiled new features to Teams, including a Together mode that puts all participants in a single virtual environment. The mode displays images of the user and up to 49 other participants in a videoconference against the same backdrop, ranging from a coffee bar for a couple people to an auditorium for larger gatherings. \u201cTogether mode makes meetings more engaging by helping you focus on other people\u2019s faces and body language and making it easier to pick up on the nonverbal cues that are so important to human interaction,\u201d Microsoft said in a statement. Several customers, including Levi Strauss & Co. LEVI, -2.24% , Stony Brook University, and the University of Texas-Arlington, have been testing Together, a Microsoft spokesperson told MarketWatch. Microsoft\u2019s stock lifted 2% on its Teams announcement. On Tuesday, Zoom said it is partnering with hardware manufacturers DTEN, Neat, Poly, and Yealink to streamline its video communication services. Zoom, whose wild popularity during the coronavirus pandemic has turned its name into a verb, has seen its stock rise 291% this year. See also: Zoom offering hardware-as-a-service option"}]}
