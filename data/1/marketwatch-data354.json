He explained that these big tech winners have been the beneficiary of falling interest rates for years now, but he warned that it won\u2019t last forever, particularly in light of the world\u2019s unprecedented policy environment. \u201cThe industry has long been obsessed, and investors are understandably obsessed with the idea that you can protect downside and capture equity upside,\u201d Hobbs said. \u201cThat is like the Holy Grail of investing.\u201d He added that a shake-up is in order for investors leaning too heavily on the tech companies driving the bull market. \u201cYou have to own some losers as well, because you have to plan for a future that isn\u2019t just a continuation of the recent past, as so often isn\u2019t the case,\u201d Hobbs said. His comments were published in the wake of a U.S. House subcommittee report, which concluded this week that Big Tech dominance poses a grave threat to market that might require breaking up top U.S. tech companies. \u201cTo put it simply, companies that once were scrappy, underdog startups that challenged the status quo have become the kinds of monopolies we last saw in the era of oil barons and railroad tycoons,\u201d Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., chairman of the House Judiciary Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law Subcommittee, said in a statement. As for Wednesday\u2019s bounceback trading session, no signs of a selloff just yet, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56%, tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39% and S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% all logging strong gains."}]}
