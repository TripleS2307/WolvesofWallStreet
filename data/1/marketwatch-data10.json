The Nasdaq Composite finished at 11,420.98, up 56.38 points, or 0.5%. For the week, the Dow gained 3.3%, while the S&P 500 was up 3.8% and the Nasdaq was up 4.6%.

The small-cap Russell 2000 RUT, +0.55% advanced 0.5% on Friday, but closed the week 6.4% higher. What drove the market? Investors remained optimistic about another fiscal stimulus package being passed by Congress eventually and stocks advanced late in the week, encouraged by continued talks between House Democrats and the Trump administration. The on-again, off-again fiscal stimulus talks in Washington sped up Friday, as bargaining warmed up over a comprehensive deal, a prospect President Trump rejected only three days ago. But after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin talked by phone, the provisions of the plan for coronavirus testing remained a sticking point. Prior to the Pelosi-Mnuchin discussion breaking up, Trump expressed his hope for a big deal while on a conservative radio talk show. Amid reports the administration was willing to go to $1.8 trillion from its previous level of $1.6 trillion in its offer, compared to the Democrats $2.2 trillion proposal, Larry Kudlow, director of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council, said Trump had signed off on a revised offer. The situation marks a sharp turnaround from Tuesday afternoon, when Trump tweeted he was pulling out of talks and both Pelosi and the Republican party Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell appeared to accept the negotiations were over until after the election. But McConnell\u2019s path to getting a deal of more than $1 trillion passed in the Senate would appear difficult as he has said some of his Republican colleagues don\u2019t want to see more stimulus spending at all.

But Kirby thinks the odds are low that anything passes in the next few weeks. \u201cIt\u2019s not in either party\u2019s best interest to do a package ahead of the election. I think they\u2019re incentivized to play ball but not come to a deal. I view election uncertainty as noise and I would be a buyer on short-term volatility.\u201d Analysts also said Democratic challenger Joe Biden\u2019s widening lead in the polls over President Donald Trump has also been seen as a supportive factor because it lessens, but doesn\u2019t eliminate, the prospect of a contested election outcome on Nov. 3, a prospect that has unnerved investors fearing weeks of legal and political wrangling. The president trails Joe Biden by an average of 9.7 percentage points nationally according to the Real Clear Politics average of polling. \u201cThe market rally is also the result of polls \u2013 both nationally and in key states \u2013 showing that Biden\u2019s lead is widening,\u201d said David Donabedian, chief investment officer of CIBC Private Wealth Management. \u201cThe market does not favor one party or another, but the widening lead reduces the odds there will be a close, contested election. That is the market\u2019s biggest fear,\u201d he said. Read: Stocks are rallying because fears of a contested election are fading COVID-19 treatment hopes were also noted, analysts said.
