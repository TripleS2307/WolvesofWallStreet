Britain left the now 27-nation EU on Jan. 31, three-and-a-half years after the country narrowly voted to end more than four decades of membership. That political departure will be followed by an economic break when an 11-month transition period ends on Dec. 31 and the U.K. leaves the EU\u2019s single market and customs union. Without a deal, the New Year will bring tariffs and other economic barriers between the U.K. and the bloc, its biggest trading partner. Johnson said the country would \u201cprosper mightily\u201d even if Britain had \u201ca trading arrangement with the EU like Australia\u2019s\u201d \u2014 the U.K. government\u2019s preferred description of a no-deal Brexit. British chief negotiator David Frost and his EU counterpart Michel Barnier are due to meet in London starting Tuesday for their eighth round of negotiations. Barnier said last week he was \u201cworried and disappointed\u201d by the lack of progress and said the U.K. had not \u201cengaged constructively.\u201d The key sticking points are European boats\u2019 access to U.K. fishing waters and state aid to industries. The EU is determined to ensure a \u201clevel playing field\u201d for competition so British firms can\u2019t undercut the bloc\u2019s environmental or workplace standards or pump public money into U.K. industries. Britain accuses the bloc of making demands that it has not imposed on other countries it has free trade deals with, such as Canada. Frost told the Mail on Sunday newspaper that Britain was \u201cnot going to compromise on the fundamentals of having control over our own laws.\u201d \u201cWe are not going to accept level playing field provisions that lock us in to the way the EU do things,\u201d he said. In another sign of potential trouble ahead, the Financial Times reported that Johnson\u2019s government was planning domestic legislation that would water down commitments to maintaining an open border between the U.K.\u2019s Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland that it has already signed up to. The border guarantee was a key part of the legally binding divorce agreement made between Britain and the bloc last year. British Brexit supporters hate the agreement because it means keeping Northern Ireland aligned to some EU rules and regulations. But any move to undermine it would infuriate the EU and threaten the trade talks. \u201cThis would be a very unwise way to proceed,\u201d tweeted Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney. The British government said it was working \u201cin good faith\u201d to implement the agreed border provisions but was \u201cconsidering fallback options in the event this is not achieved.\u201d The EU says a deal has to be struck before November to allow time for parliamentary approval and legal vetting before the transition period expires. Johnson gave an even shorter deadline in remarks he\u2019s due to deliver on Monday, saying an agreement needed to be sealed by an EU summit scheduled for Oct. 15. \u201cIf we can\u2019t agree by then, then I do not see that there will be a free trade agreement between us, and we should both accept that and move on,\u201d he said in the comments, which were released in advance by his office. Without a deal, British freight firms have warned there could be logjams at ports and supplies of key goods in Britain could be \u201cseverely disrupted\u201d starting Jan. 1. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said Sunday that talks were \u201cnot going well\u201d and dismissed British attempts to drive a wedge between EU nations on issues such as fishing. Le Drian said the 27 nations remained united. \u201cWe would prefer a deal, but a deal on the basis of our mandate,\u201d he told France Inter radio. \u201cThere is room for action, but the whole package, including the fishing package, needs to be taken up in order to avoid a \u2018no deal.\u2019\u201d"}]}
