Trump accused his most experienced infectious-disease expert of mistakes in a Fox News interview at the weekend, and administration officials gave the Washington Post a series of talking points outlining failures such as mixed messaging on wearing face masks. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Arne Duncan, former education secretary, said the war on science will cost lives. \u201cThe real travesty here is that there is no body count high enough for the president to actually pay attention to science,\u201d Duncan said in an interview with MSNBC. \u201cWe could lose another 10,000. We could lose another 50,000. We could lose another 100,000. Nothing would compel him to listen to Dr. Fauci and others who are actually fighting to try and save lives.\u201d See also: New York Gov.

Read now:Race for a COVID-19 vaccine has drugmakers scaling up manufacturing \u2014 before one is developedWhat are companies saying? The second--quarter earnings season kicked off early Tuesday with earnings from three of the biggest U.S. banks and Delta Air. Bank earnings predictably showed gains from trading volatile markets and fees from underwriting debt and equity deals offsetting weakness in consumer banking and a big boost in loan loss provisions. See:S&P 500 earnings set to plunge as the coronavirus batters all sectors \u2014 with Wall Street counting on a bounce that may not come JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM, -0.57% and Citigroup Inc. C, +0.47% managed to beat analyst estimates, even as profits fell, while Wells Fargo swung to a wider-than-expected loss, its first in more than a decade. Wells Chief Executive Charles Scharf said the bankwas \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d in its results and need to cut its dividend. \u201cOur view of the length and severity of the economic downturn has deteriorated considerably from the assumptions used last quarter, which drove the $8.4 billion addition to our credit loss reserve in the second quarter,\u201d he said. Delta DAL, +0.39% also reported a bigger-than-expected loss as the pandemic grounded flights and recession destroyed demand. Elsewhere, companies continued to update guidance and analysts continued to adjust models for the new COVID world. Here\u2019s the latest news about companies and the pandemic: \u2022 Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.\u2019s BBBY, -1.37% June same-store sales were \u201cpositive\u201d for reopened stores and digital channels. Cash flow during June was also positive. Nearly all stores have reopened, following closures because of the pandemic. Separately, the company believes there is between $350 million to $450 million it could get from asset sales and the plan to reduce up to $1 billion of inventory at retail is slightly more than halfway complete. \u2022 Analyst James Hardiman at Wedbush cut his price target on Carnival Corp. CCL, +0.51% to $20 from $29 while reiterating his neutral rating, in the wake of the cruise operator\u2019s announcements last week that three of its AIDA Cruises will start resailingin August, and that cumulative advance bookings for 2021 remained within historical ranges, although at lower prices. \u201cWhile a legitimate target for the restart of the AIDA brand is encouraging, we can\u2019t help but think that we remain a far distance away from operations resuming in the United States given a resurgence in COVID-19 cases as well as halted (in some instances reversed) economic reopenings,\u201d Hardiman wrote in a note to clients. \u2022 Delta Air Lines Inc. DAL, +0.39% reported second-quarter losses that were wider than expected, although revenue beat lowered expectations. Passenger revenue for the quarter fell 94% to $678 million, and cargo revenue was down 42% to $108 million. \u201cGiven the combined effects of the pandemic and associated financial impact on the global economy, we continue to believe that it will be more than two years before we see a sustainable recovery,\u201d said Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian, emphasizing the \u201cstaggering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.\u201d Delta ended the quarter with $15.7 billion in liquidity, and reduced its daily cash burn in June by 70% compared to late March, down to an average of $27 million. The airline has received $5.4 billion in grant funds and unsecured loans through the CARES Act, which will be paid in installments through July 2020. Maturities on $1.3 billion in borrowings on revolving credit facilities have been extended to 2022 from 2021. Delta has taken additional sanitation steps in the face of the coronavirus pandemic, has limited load factor at 60% and is blocking off middle seats. The company has provided more than $2.2 billion in cash refunds in 2020. Delta is positioning itself to be a smaller airline over the next couple of years, retiring MD-88 and other planes, and reducing head count through early retirement and other programs. The company is also accelerating airport construction projects in New York\u2019s LaGuardia Airport, in Los Angeles and other cities. At the end of the quarter, the company had total debt and finance lease obligations of $24.6 billion. Delta took a write down of $1.1 billion on its investment in LATAM Airlines and a write down of $770 million on its investment in AeroMexico after those companies\u2019 losses and bankruptcy filings. The company took a $200 million write down in its investment in Virgin Atlantic, a $200 million charge. \u2022 BS analyst Eric Sheridan downgraded Netflix Inc.\u2019s NFLX, +1.43% stock to neutral from buy, writing that while the company looks poised to report a strong June quarter as it continued to benefit from COVID-19 lockdowns, investors seem to have already priced in these benefits to Netflix\u2019s shares. \u201cUnlike prior periods over the last few months (with debates centered around competition with Disney, balance sheet vs. free-cash flow generation, content costs/competition), investor fears seem to have disappeared and the current stock price increasingly reflects many of the long-term business moat dynamics including sustained growth in users/revs and steady state margin expansion,\u201d Sheridan said in his note to clients. He sees tough subscriber comparisons ahead for the company next year and wrote that he \u201cwould rather be constructive at levels when a mix of potential subscriber volatility, FCF dynamics & competition are better reflected in the share price.\u201d Sheridan kept his $535 price target unchanged. \u2022 Tesla Inc. TSLA, +1.89% extended their seemingly unstoppable rally, after Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter raised his price target on the stock to $2322 from $939, writing of \u201cfaster-than-expected share gains\u201d and big opportunities in software. Though Tesla shares have rocketed nearly 260% on the year and the stock\u2019s valuation is 88 times higher than it was after its 2010 initial public offering, Potter said that \u201cresoundingly\u201d his conclusion is to stick with the stock. \u201cWhile deliveries are a key driver of our increased near-term estimates, software is the biggest driver of our increased DCF-based price target,\u201d he wrote in a late Monday note to clients. \u201cTesla has noted the possibility for 30%+ gross margins if/when more customers opt-in for purchasing the company\u2019s full self-driving (FSD) software.\u201d That could help Tesla record operating margins in the \u201cmid-20s\u201d by the end of Potter\u2019s 20-year forecast period, even if only half of customers go for the full self-driving software. \u201cThanks to the high-margin nature of the FSD package, we think that by the 2030s, Tesla could conceivably be selling vehicles at cost - or even below cost - while still achieving higher operating margins,\u201d he wrote. Tesla shares have rallied even though its main California plant was closed for much of the recent quarter because of the pandemic. See:Tesla\u2019s earnings on tap next week: Will a loss end its blowout stock rally? \u2022 The Travelers Cos. Inc. TRV, +0.18% expects to report a net loss per share of 16 cents for the second quarter, weighed down by a high level of catastrophe losses, mostly stemming from severe storms in the U.S., along with claims related to social unrest. The New York-based insurer is expecting net investment income of $268 million pretax, or $251 million after-tax, including $511 million from its fixed income portfolio and a loss of $234 million in the non-fixed income portfolio. That is equal to $438 million after-tax and $180 million after-tax respectively. The company is expecting the pandemic to have a modest impact on its underwriting result. Insurance losses directly caused by the pandemic are expected to come to $114 million pretax. The company will report second-quarter earnings on July 23. \u2022 Wells Fargo & Co. tumbled 6.5%, enough to pace the large-capitalization banking sector\u2019s decliners, after the bank reported second-quarter results that missed expectations. The stock is on track to suffer the biggest one-day post-earnings decline since it tumbled 8.4% on Oct. 17, 2011, after third-quarter 2011 results were released. Additional reporting by Tim Rostan"}]}
