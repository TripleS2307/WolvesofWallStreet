If that sounds iffy, think again. The fund, the Impact Shares NAACP Minority Empowerment ETF NACP, +0.41% \u00c2 , is the only financial product that explicitly addresses issues of racial inequality, doing so with the backing of one of America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s oldest and most prestigious civil rights groups. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a blueprint for how mission-driven organizations can engage the corporate sector in making social change, especially around racism, an issue that often seems forgotten in a financial services landscape crowded with other \u00e2\u0080\u009csocially responsible\u00e2\u0080\u009d plays. And at a moment when America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention is squarely on racial justice, it may check investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 boxes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs people lose confidence in Wall Street\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to generate alpha, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to look for other ways to derive value from their capital,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ethan Powell, founder of Impact Shares, a first-of-its-kind nonprofit ETF provider. Socially responsible investing, Powell thinks, is \u00e2\u0080\u009ca natural extension of that, but the financial services industry doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the acumen for it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, founded in 1909, comes in. The organization has a long history of corporate engagement, said Marvin Owens, its senior director for economic programs, but saw involvement with the ETF as a way to spin that work forward. The NAACP developed a list of 10 principles, called \u00e2\u0080\u009cscreens\u00e2\u0080\u009d for the purpose of the ETF, ranging from the familiar, like board and executive team diversity, all the way to lesser-known ideas like how companies address the digital divide and support local community development programs. Index and research provider Morningstar developed an index around those screens, and Sustainalytics, a third-party vendor, does the due diligence on companies inside the index. In theory, the NAACP should share in a cut of the ETF\u00e2\u0080\u0099s profits, but that won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be possible until it reaches $20 million in assets. But for Owens, the work put in to create actionable ways of assessing companies has been more than worth it. Corporations often support the NAACP in ways he called \u00e2\u0080\u009ctransactional,\u00e2\u0080\u009d such as paying for ads or buying tables at events. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe ETF has allowed us to engage corporations in discussions: what is your commitment to a diverse board, to supplier diversity, and so on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Owens told MarketWatch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith corporations that have funded us historically, the ETF has allowed us to step back and say, we thank you for your support, but the data shows this or that. It gives us credibility, takes away from the idea that the NAACP can be paid off.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Read next:Do well by doing good with this fund that supports freedom and human rights The match between ImpactShares and the NAACP came courtesy of the Innovative Finance team at the Rockefeller Foundation, which has funded ImpactShares, as well. Lorenzo Bernasconi, that group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s managing director, also applauds the advocacy that the index framework permits, but thinks the ETF can unlock even more opportunity. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe face a whole set of large environmental and social challenges which government and philanthropy cannot address alone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bernasconi said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe ETF builds on two major trends in capital markets: an interest in impact investing and a shift toward passive investments.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Many smaller fund issuers face a vicious circle: they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t attract assets unless they have enough assets to convince would-be investors the fund is a safe bet. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a real concern for Ethan Powell, who says that, as the manager of a nonprofit, he works \u00e2\u0080\u009cpro bono\u00e2\u0080\u009d and all his vendors offer concessions of some sort. For the deep-pocketed Rockefeller Foundation, however, Impact Shares isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just a feel-good handout. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe make bets on ideas we think have a $1 billion-plus opportunity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bernasconi told MarketWatch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe take a patient view on these things and understand it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to take time. If anything, what we see today in the U.S. is that the mission of the NAACP is more critical than ever. This is a volume game: once you get close to critical volume, the floodgates open. We have every confidence that as the market becomes aware of products like this, over time it will reach the scale it needs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Related:The eviction crisis is starting to look a lot like the subprime mortgage crisis Perhaps a bigger surprise is that the ETF can be more than a feel-good handout for the investing public, as well. While its index may serve as a document of which companies do the right thing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and which ones don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a list of some well-known strong performers, from Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.74% \u00c2 to the Atlantica Sustainable Infrastructure YieldCo AY, -3.96% \u00c2 , noted Todd Rosenbluth, head of mutual fund and ETF research at CFRA, which has a five-star rating on the fund. In the year to date, the fund is up 4%, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% \u00c2 is down 1.3%. Over the past 12 months, the fund has gained 19%, beating the 12.8% increase in the broader market. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is clearly flying below the radar for investors,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rosenbluth said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis fund exists for the right reasons and should get more attention.\u00e2\u0080\u009d For all the tragedy of the past few weeks, as anger in America over the treatment over people of color has boiled over, everyone involved with the fund hopes it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an opportunity. Powell believes critical mass in investment dollars into socially responsible funds is proof of a real desire in America for change. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOn a daily basis people of color face structural obstacles that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as overt as putting a knee on someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neck,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe fund itself represents a structural change in how we do capital allocation and hopefully is a call to action to corporate America. This is a way to create a virtuous circle of capital.\u00e2\u0080\u009d For his part, the NAACP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Owens says social change, in contrast to environmental advocacy, is also a tool of investing strategy, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis much more organic. You have to feel it and see it. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why I think what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening in the country right now is an inflection point that will cause more attention to come to this.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Read:Four years, $13 million and dozens of hands: How \u00e2\u0080\u0098affordable housing\u00e2\u0080\u0099 gets made in America"}]}
