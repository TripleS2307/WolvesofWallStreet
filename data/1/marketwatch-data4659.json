Alexander Hassenstein/Getty Images Germany recorded its worst deterioration in the economy in the second quarter since 1970, according to statistics released on Thursday. German gross domestic product fell a seasonally adjusted 10.1% quarter-on-quarter, which was worse than the 9% drop forecast by economists. The Federal Statistical Office said there was a \u201cmassive slump\u201d for exports and imports of goods and services, as well as for household final consumption expenditure and capital formation in machinery and equipment. The release came much faster than usual, just 30 days after the quarter ended versus the more typical 45 days. The statistics agency warned the revision therefore might be more substantial than usual. \u201cAmid significant uncertainty about current activity this challenge is even more daunting than usual. While higher-frequency data such as retail footfall data, flight statistics and truck mileage provide a guide to current trends, it remains unclear how closely some of the newly-watched measures track official statistics,\u201d said Florian Hense, an economist at Berenberg Bank, who added the economy may recover some 40% of its losses in the third quarter. The U.S. separately reported a 32.9% annualized drop in second-quarter GDP. Year-over-year, U.S. GDP fell 9.5%, vs. the 11.7% year-over-year drop for the German economy. The euro EURUSD, +0.60% drifted lower while the reaction was most pronounced in the stock market, as the German DAX DAX, +0.06% skidded 3.3%."}]}
