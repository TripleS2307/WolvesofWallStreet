But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth understanding what patient information the federal law does and doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t protect \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s completely irrelevant to the topic at hand. HIPAA, short for the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, was enacted in 1996 and went into effect in 2003. Broadly speaking, it is a federal health-care privacy law that shields individuals\u00e2\u0080\u0099 protected health information from release by health-care providers without the individual\u00e2\u0080\u0099s permission, Margaret Foster Riley, a professor of law at the University of Virginia School of Law, told MarketWatch. Its rules \u00e2\u0080\u009cessentially provide for the privacy and security of personal health information held by traditional health-care providers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 so doctors, hospitals, pharmacies,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nicolas Terry, the executive director of the Hall Center for Law and Health at Indiana University. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt restricts the sharing of personal health information that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s identifiable to persons involved in the care of the patient, and in some cases some sort of billing and quality-control issues.\u00e2\u0080\u009d HIPAA has exceptions, Terry added. The subject of the medical record, for example, can authorize a health-care provider to share the information more broadly if they choose. And the law has provisions by which information can be shared with public-health authorities, the legal system and some other entities, he said.\u00c2 For HIPAA to apply to a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s information, the information must be held by a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccovered entity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d meaning anyone involved in the provision and payment of health care, as well as health-care clearinghouses and insurers, Riley said. But the rule does not extend to your employer, she added.Yes, HIPAA protects President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s medical information\u00c2 White House physician Sean Conley on Monday shared certain details about Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s condition, including his blood pressure and heart rate. But in response to questions about the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lung scans and the date of his last negative coronavirus test, the doctor cited \u00e2\u0080\u009cHIPAA rules and regulations that restrict me in sharing certain things for his safety and his own health.\u00e2\u0080\u009d White House spokesman Brian Morgenstern on Friday also repeatedly declined to answer questions about when the president last tested negative for COVID-19, telling MSNBC host Hallie Jackson that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe president doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t check all of his HIPAA rights at the door just when he becomes president.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The date of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last negative test is key to understanding his illness timeline and which contacts he could potentially have exposed to the virus. \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098You control your HIPAA rights, so you have the right to say to your health-care provider, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou may release this much information, but not this other information.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Margaret Riley, a professor of law at the University of Virginia School of Law \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe president shares a great deal of information with the American public: We have gone through numerous briefings with the doctors, half a dozen memos from the doctors, his daily vitals we put out yesterday,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Morgenstern said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust because he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean he shares every single detail of his entire life, but we do share enough information certainly for public-health purposes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Because Trump is receiving health care from a covered entity, his information would be protected under the law, Riley and Terry said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is no doubt that the Walter Reed hospital and the physicians working out of Walter Reed would be covered by HIPAA, and that therefore information that they have about the president would be protected by HIPAA,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Terry said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHIPAA would probably also apply to the relationship between the White House doctor and the president \u00e2\u0080\u0094 so generally, this is HIPAA-protected information.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Since Conley provided some details about Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s condition but cited privacy concerns about others, it appears that the president only waived his HIPAA rights up to a certain extent, Riley said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou control your HIPAA rights, so you have the right to say to your health-care provider, \u00e2\u0080\u0098You may release this much information, but not this other information,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Riley said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likely what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s little doubt that the public has a justifiable interest in knowing about the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health, Terry said, assuming the information is responsibly provided and doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t include \u00e2\u0080\u009cscandalous or embarrassing details.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAn honest assessment reported to the American public is something that we would expect in a democracy, and it would be extremely easy for the president to make that information available,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Terry said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll he would have to do is tell his personal doctor or tell the Walter Reed doctors that they have his consent to provide information.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098HIPAA and privacy laws, almost routinely, are used as excuses not to communicate.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Nicolas Terry, executive director of the Hall Center for Law and Health at Indiana University The White House seemed to use a \u00e2\u0080\u0098pretextual excuse,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 says one expert White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, who would later test positive for the virus herself, declined last Sunday to provide the number of White House staffers who had tested positive for COVID-19. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are privacy concerns \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we take very seriously safeguarding the information of the personnel here in the White House,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she told reporters. But the White House is not a covered entity under HIPAA, Riley said. Terry, for his part, called McEnany\u00e2\u0080\u0099s response \u00e2\u0080\u009ca pretextual excuse\u00e2\u0080\u009d and noted that \u00e2\u0080\u009cHIPAA and privacy laws, almost routinely, are used as excuses not to communicate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cI see absolutely nothing in HIPAA or any other federal privacy laws that would stop the White House giving broad information about the level of transmission within the White House and the number of persons infected, or even when persons were infected \u00e2\u0080\u0094 because I think you can provide that information without specifically identifying the person,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Identifying the person by name might mean the White House is breaching the confidentiality of its employee, he added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arguably not HIPAA that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in play there, because the White House is not a health-care provider, without knowing more about how internal affairs at the White House work.\u00e2\u0080\u009d HIPAA isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a \u00e2\u0080\u0098get-out-of-jail-free card\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Earlier in the pandemic, misinformation about mask-wearing exemptions proliferated online. This included posts falsely informing people that their medical conditions exempted them from mask mandates and claiming that HIPAA barred others from asking about their medical condition. This example, Riley said, is \u00e2\u0080\u009cridiculous.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Businesses open to the public are not covered entities under HIPAA, she said, and \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey can impose any reasonable requirements to protect the health and welfare of their employees and other customers under the [Americans with Disabilities Act] and related and similar laws.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe onus would be on the individual to provide credible information about a disability, and even then, that credible information doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily trump the obligation of the employer to protect its employees and other customers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey could refuse the individual entry if the individual doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to wear a mask, even if that individual had a health condition that might preclude a mask. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But none of this has anything to do with HIPAA.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Terry agreed that the example was \u00e2\u0080\u009cnonsense.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cHIPAA does not give you a get-out-of-jail-free card,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf someone says that \u00e2\u0080\u0098We need you to do something for public health reasons,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to do that because of HIPAA.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 It just doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work that way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2 \u201c There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also plenty of information that HIPAA doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t protect, given that so much health and health-adjacent data is now stored outside of the traditional health-care system. \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople have a tendency to think that because they interact with their health-care providers and often sign HIPAA disclosure forms \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 that HIPAA covers all health-care privacy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Riley said. But HIPAA \u00e2\u0080\u009chas relatively confined rules,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just people outside the health-care system who exaggerate HIPAA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role, Terry added \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2 sometimes, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s people within the system. While \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe all recognize that the free flow of health-care information amongst our care team\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a good thing, he said, health-care providers will sometimes use HIPAA as an excuse not to share health information. Sometimes, though not always, \u00e2\u0080\u009cone gets the impression that maybe some health-care providers don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to share personal health information because they want to keep that patient within their own network, rather than letting them escape to somebody else\u00e2\u0080\u0099s network,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\u00c2 HIPAA covers a \u00e2\u0080\u0098shriveling\u00e2\u0080\u0099 share of traditional health-care data There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plenty of information HIPAA doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t protect, given that so much health and health-adjacent data now lives outside of the traditional health-care ecosystem, Riley and Terry said. Data generated by your Fitbit FIT, -0.14% or Apple AAPL, +1.74% Watch or stored in your phone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s software won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be covered under HIPAA in most cases, Terry said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecause the persons supplying the software or the hardware or doing the collection are not traditional health-care providers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d While most health information was indeed stored by traditional health-care providers at the time of HIPAA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inception, Terry said, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no longer the case.\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs health has become much more electronic, as health and wellness have become industries, and as large entities, particularly big tech, have entered this space, so the idea that health information is only stored by health providers has been proved to be false,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Terry said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYet we have failed as a country to pass strong privacy protections to deal with information, be it health or financial or anything else, that is held by data brokers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That leaves a \u00e2\u0080\u009cshriveling\u00e2\u0080\u009d share of traditional health-care data as a slice of the pie, he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe amount that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being held by traditional health-care providers is as a percentage reducing, and more and more health information is being held by non-HIPAA entities,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd that information is, to a large extent, unprotected by federal law.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}]}
