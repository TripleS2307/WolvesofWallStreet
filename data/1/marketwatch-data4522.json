China's official manufacturing purchasing managers' index rose to 51.1 in July from 50.9 in June, the National Bureau of Statistics said Friday. The reading was also higher than the median forecast of 50.7 expected by economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. The result marked the fifth consecutive month that the major gauge of China's manufacturing activity came in above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction. The subindex measuring production rose to 54.0 in July, compared with June's 53.9. Total new orders increased to 51.7 in July, compared with 51.4, while new export orders improved to 48.4 , still below the 50 mark but much higher than 42.6 in June. China's factory production has led the recovery since the second quarter, when the economy rebounded to 3.2% on-year growth from a 6.8% contraction in the first three months. Also released on Friday, China's nonmanufacturing PMI, which includes service and construction activity, slipped to 54.2 in July, compared with 54.4 in June."}]}
