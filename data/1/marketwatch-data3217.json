That's from analyst Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley, who on Tuesday upped his price target on TSLA, +1.89%  shares to $740, implying a downside of around 47% from Tuesday's share price. Jonas also set a \"bull case scenario\" stock price of $2,070, an upside of around 48%. According to FactSet, which surveyed 32 Tesla analysts, the average price target on the stock is $778, with a handful of outliers setting price targets above $1,000. Recently, analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush also set a \"bull case scenario\" for Tesla shares at $2,000 alongside his price target of $1,250. Tesla's second-quarter production and delivery numbers were \"significantly ahead\" of Morgan Stanley's expectations in a three-month period that was shaping up to be \"extremely difficult,\" Jonas said. Don't miss:Tesla stock rockets higher as quarterly sales crush expectations \"Tesla has demonstrated one very powerful differentiating quality vs. many of its auto peers: demand is holding up better,\" Jonas said in his note. Tesla may see some cash burn from its working capital but it is \"in position to post an above break-even U.S. GAAP result in (the second quarter).\" Some long-term concerns remain, chiefly around profits in China, \"poor\" fundamentals for the auto industry in general, and the \"inevitable\" competition in EV and in autonomous vehicles from well-heeled companies such as Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +3.01%, Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.74%, Alphabet Inc. GOOG, +1.97%  and others, Jonas said. Tesla shares have been on a tear in recent sessions, boosted by the quarterly sales data, and on Tuesday were poised for a fifth straight record close. The stock has gained 235% this year, contrasting with losses of 2% and 8% for the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87%  and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. DJIA, +0.56% "}]}
