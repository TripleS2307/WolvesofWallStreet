It turned out to be a deal breaker, according to New York Times reporting. It was Mark Meadows, the former North Carolina congressman and Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fourth chief of staff, who is said to have hinged the agreement, which reportedly would have seen the drug makers spending $150 billion to help rein in out-of-pocket consumer costs and pick up the bulk of the co-payments that fall to older Americans enrolled in Medicare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prescription drug program, on the mailing of $100 prepaid cards to older Americans. A White House spokesman reportedly would not comment on the matter of the savings cards, which sources indicated to the Times were to have arrived before Election Day. President Donald Trump.
