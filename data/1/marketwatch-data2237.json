The Fed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s median forecast is fairly upbeat, expecting the unemployment rate to drop to 7.6% by the end of the year and 5.5% at the end of 2021, along with a gradual return of inflation to the 2% target. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy views are that the economy remains fragile,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rosengren said, in a speech to the Boston Economic Club. The Boston Fed president said his forecast for a slower recovery hinges on \u00e2\u0080\u009cseveral challenges\u00e2\u0080\u009d the economy could face in coming months. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am concerned that a second wave of COVID-19 infections this fall and winter is likely, which could cause some states to impose new restrictions on mobility and face-to-face interactions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rosengren said. He said he was also worried that more spending from Congress to support the economy \u00e2\u0080\u009cseems unlikely to materialize anytime soon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rosengren added that he expects financial spillovers from businesses impacted by the virus \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill become a more significant headwind going forward,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cI certainly hope this less-optimistic outlook turns out to be wrong,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Boston Fed president said. He said additional fiscal stimulus and continued monetary stimulus remains necessary. Stocks were lower on Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% \u00c2 down 120 points."}]}
