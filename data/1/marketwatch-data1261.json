The European Union Commission didn\u2019t show sufficient evidence to back up a 2016 ruling that Apple\u2019s businesses in Ireland were granted unfair tax advantages, the court said. The General Court of the European Union, one of Europe\u2019s highest courts, annulled the ruling, which had ordered Ireland to recover the money. It said Ireland would have to recover taxes from Apple covering the years 2003-2014 of \u20ac13 billion plus interest. The Commission launched a state aid investigation in 2014 that said the tax paid by two Irish incorporated arms of Apple, Apple Sales International, and Apple Operations Europe, \u201cdidn\u2019t correspond to economic reality.\u201d It said Apple Sales International had paid corporation tax in Ireland at a rate of 1% in 2003, declining to 0.005% by 2014.

Apple welcomed the ruling. \u201cWe thank the General Court for their time and consideration of the facts. We are pleased they have annulled the Commission\u2019s case,\u201d it said. \u201cWe\u2019re proud to be the largest taxpayer in the world as we know the important role tax payments play in society. Apple has paid more than $100 billion in corporate income taxes around the world in the last decade and tens of billions more in other taxes,\u201d it added. Read:Apple hits back at EU\u2019s tax order The European Commission can appeal the decision in the European Court of Justice, and Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager said the Commission will be considering next steps. \u201cToday\u2019s judgment by the General Court annuls the Commission\u2019s August 2016 decision that Ireland granted illegal state aid to Apple through selective tax breaks. We will carefully study the judgment and reflect on possible next steps,\u201d said Vestager, who is the European Commissioner for Competition. \u201cThe Commission stands fully behind the objective that all companies should pay their fair share of tax,\u201d she added. The money will remain in a holding account while the parties wait for certainty about whether there will be an appeal against the ruling. A commission spokeswoman told reporters on Wednesday it would evaluate whether to appeal but did not say how long that would take. The ruling is one of many that have come in front of the court as Vestager seeks to crack down on so-called sweetheart tax deals between companies and countries in the European single market. In 2019 the court annulled a decision by the Commission ordering the Netherlands to recover up to \u20ac30 million in back taxes from Starbucks SBUX, +0.53%. Meanwhile, it upheld a decision that Fiat FIAT, had received tax advantages that broke European state aid laws. Wednesday\u2019s ruling could impact ongoing investigations into tax deals between the Netherlands and Nike NKE, +0.97% and IKEA."}]}
