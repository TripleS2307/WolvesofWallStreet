First, he was fixated on the stock market over fixing the problem.\" \u201d - Kamala Harris The line above came Thursday from Kamala Harris, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden's running mate, as she delivered a speech in which she attacked President Donald Trump's handling of the coronavirus crisis. Harris went on to say that Trump tweeted about the market \"consistently during this period. He was convinced that if his administration focused on this virus, it would hurt the market and hurt his chances of being re-elected.\" \"Second, right at the moment we needed Donald Trump to be tough on the Chinese government, he caved,\" she added, noting that Trump praised Beijing's response to COVID-19 in January.

He's the president of the United States, and it's not supposed to be about him. It's supposed to be about the health and the safety and the well-being of the American people. And on that measure, Donald Trump has failed.\" See: Trump to attack Biden tonight as a 'weak candidate with a poor record' Harris also addressed the recent shooting by police in Kenosha, Wis., of a Black man, Jacob Blake, saying it was \"sickening\" and she supported those protesting peacefully. She said the country must have criminal-justice reform and address systemic racism.
