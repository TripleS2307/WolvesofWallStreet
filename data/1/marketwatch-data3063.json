AFP via Getty Images By now, President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tactics of division and diversion are well known. There was a horrible economic report today: The U.S. economy collapsed at a 33% pace in the second quarter, by far a record.\u00c2 And so Diversion Don, desperately trying to change the conversation, says the November election should be delayed. Let me emphasize: Presidents do NOT have any authority to delay or set the date for an election. The Constitution grants that power to Congress. Trump is free to ask his good friend Nancy Pelosi what she thinks.\u00c2 In calling to reschedule the election, Trump is meddling in one of our most cherished traditions and pillars of American democracy: our right to choose our leaders by free, fair and open elections. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a reflection of his well-known authoritarian impulses. The economy is bad, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re past the 150,000 mark on coronavirus deaths; Trump knows he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behind\u00e2\u0080\u0094perhaps way behind\u00e2\u0080\u0094former Vice President Joe Biden.\u00c2 The United States has held elections in the midst of Civil War, in the midst of the Great Depression, and in terrible years like 1968, when there were assassinations, there was social unrest that eclipsed what we have encountered this year. There was even a pandemic in 1968. The election will go on as scheduled\u00e2\u0080\u0094whether Desperate Don likes it or not.\u00c2 Problems in many states That being said, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth remembering that several states had all sorts of problems during primaries and caucuses earlier this year. If we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not careful, there could be big problems in November. In Georgia, for example, hopeful voters ran into problem after problem. At polling stations, there weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enough workers to check\u00c2 people in and voting machines were malfunctioning. Officials promised to ease bottlenecks by providing paper ballots, but didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. Voters witnessed, writes Norm Ornstein in\u00c2 The Atlantic, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca perfect storm of bad luck, malfeasance, and ineptitude.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Variations on these sorts of problems exist across much of the nation. Variations on these sorts of problems exist across much of the nation. \u00c2 \u00c2 Such \u00e2\u0080\u009cmalfeasance, and ineptitude\u00e2\u0080\u009d is an opening for bad actors to stir the pot. This declassified\u00e2\u0080\u0094but heavily redacted\u00e2\u0080\u0094Senate Intelligence Committee report says that, although the committee saw no hard evidence that Russians were able to change any votes in the 2016 election, Moscow \u00e2\u0080\u009cmay have been probing vulnerabilities in voting systems to exploit later.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In other words, 2016 may have been just a dry run for\u00e2\u0080\u0094well, this year, perhaps.\u00c2 Ignorance and complacency Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s be honest here. That we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve allowed an enemy to get this close can be blamed on our own ignorance and complacency. The intelligence committee report adds: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn 2016, cybersecurity for electoral infrastructure at the state and local level was sorely lacking; for example, voter registration databases weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as secure as they could have been. Aging voting equipment, particularly voting machines that had no paper record of votes, were vulnerable to exploitation by a committed adversary. Despite the focus on this issue since 2016, some of these vulnerabilities remain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2 This is a national emergency. That the federal government\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Trump administration\u00e2\u0080\u0094and states aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t making a flat out effort to patch these vulnerabilities is an outrage. Assorted legislation has stalled in Congress amid partisan bickering\u00e2\u0080\u0094reflecting the fact that some Americans have chosen to treat the integrity of our elections as a partisan issue, a left-right, blue-red thing. This is far beyond petty partisanship. The enemy is at the gate\u00e2\u0080\u0094and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re squabbling with each other? Shame on\u00c2 us. \u00c2 Adding to all this is the coronavirus, which will certainly be with\u00c2 us\u00c2 in November and beyond. Typically, one of every four workers at polling stations is age 70 or more, says the federal Elections Assistance Commission pandemic fears may keep them home on Nov. 3.\u00c2 \u00c2 \u00c2 \u00c2 Think lines were long during primary season? What do you think Nov. 3 will look like? How long do you think folks will wait outside in, say, Detroit, if it is snowing and 26 degrees on Election Day? Some voters may just give up, or not bother showing up in the first place\u00e2\u0080\u0094this in a state that Trump won in 2016 by just 10,704 votes.\u00c2 Voting by mail The answer to many of these issues lies in voting by mail. Before I go any further, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dispense with a giant lie that is always being peddled by President Donald Trump and swallowed by his I-automatically-believe-anything-he-says-without-thinking-for-myself followers: That absentee balloting is rife with corruption. Rubbish. Since 2000 more than a quarter of a billion votes have been cast via mailed-out ballots, in all 50 states, notes the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School, which says \u00e2\u0080\u009cfraud rates remain infinitesimally small.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To give just one example: Oregon, one of the early adopters of voting by mail, \u00e2\u0080\u009chas documented only about a dozen cases of proven fraud\u00e2\u0080\u009d in 20 years; state officials say that is 0.0000001% of all votes cast. \u00c2 One reason voting by mail is so secure is that there are numerous, and overlapping security measures: Identity verification, bar-coded envelopes, ballot tracking via the U.S. Postal Service, secure drop-off locations and drop boxes and, after the fact, postelection audits.\u00c2 Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s response to all this? The whole thing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009crigged.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As usual, he offers zero proof against this mountain of evidence against this\u00e2\u0080\u0094or any of the other conspiracy theories he has peddled over the years.\u00c2 The solutions What can be done to make November go smoother?\u00c2 \u00c2 The shortage of poll workers can be alleviated easily: Millions of Americans are unemployed; funds should be made available for training and staffing. High school and college students should also be recruited. \u00c2 Mail balloting needs to be expanded, and fast. But ballots can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be printed until at least after Trump and Biden are officially certified as candidates by their parties next month. Other parties\u00e2\u0080\u0094remember the Greens?\u00e2\u0080\u0094may also get into the act. Ornstein offers additional advice as well, urging a crash effort by Congress, federal and state officials, and relevant agencies such as the Postal Service. All must step up their game. Botched deliveries, like the ones that occurred in DC and Maryland, cannot occur. None of this is hyperbole. It goes straight to the core of whether we the people can vote, and whether we can know with assurance that our vote will be counted in a fair and timely manner. Upon this simple and cherished exercise we have chosen our leaders for more than two centuries."}]}
