AstraZeneca AZN, +1.16% and its partner, the University of Oxford, voluntarily paused its Phase 3 vaccine study worldwide on Sept. 9, after a volunteer in the U.K. developed an \u201cunexplained illness.\u201d Regulators in the U.K., Brazil, India and South Africa have since allowed AstraZeneca AZN, +0.63% to resume its clinical trials, but the British drugmaker\u2019s late-stage U.S. trials have remained on hold. The FDA has requested further data, the Reuters report said, citing two sources. The data were expected to arrive this week, after which the agency would need time to analyze. When the British drugmaker paused its trials, it said that unexplained illnesses can happen \u201cby chance\u201d in large trials and must be independently reviewed. An information sheet for participants in the trial from the University of Oxford states that the \u201cunexplained neurological symptoms,\u201d which included changed sensation or limb weakness, were either considered unlikely to be associated with the vaccine or there was \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d to say for certain whether the illnesses \u201cwere or were not related to the vaccine.\u201d Read: There are four coronavirus vaccines in late-stage studies \u2014 here\u2019s how they differ Sources told Reuters that the FDA was interested in other vaccines developed by the Oxford researchers, which used an adenovirus found in chimpanzees. The news agency said that the regulator wants to look at whether similar side effects emerged in trials of other vaccines designed by the same researchers. However, the broadening of the investigation doesn\u2019t show that the FDA believes there were safety issues associated with any of these vaccines, the report added, with one source saying that the regulator was \u201cbeing thorough.\u201d A spokesperson for AstraZeneca said: \u201cWe are continuing to work with the FDA to facilitate review of the information needed to make a decision regarding resumption of the U.S. trial.\u201d The FDA declined to comment. Read: AstraZeneca vaccine \u2018most likely\u2019 to roll out in the U.K. early next year Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on Sept. 9 that AstraZeneca\u2019s decision to pause global trials of its experimental coronavirus vaccine was \u201cunfortunate\u201d \u2014 but not an uncommon safety precaution in a vaccine development process. In June, the World Health Organization\u2019s chief scientist Dr. Soumya Swaminathan described AstraZeneca\u2019s experimental shot as probably the world\u2019s leading candidate and the most advanced in terms of development. Swaminathan also said that Moderna\u2019s MRNA, +0.09% COVID-19 vaccine candidate wasn\u2019t \u201cfar behind\u201d AstraZeneca\u2019s.
