The deal marks the second struck by Sanofi Chief Executive Paul Hudson since he took over as head of the French drugmaker from Olivier Brandicourt in September. Just three months later, Sanofi snapped up Synthorx to bolster its immuno-oncology pipeline for $2.5 billion Under the terms of the deal, announced on Monday, Sanofi SAN, +1.20% will offer $100 a share in cash to shareholders of Prinicipia Biopharma US:PRNB, representing a 10% premium to the closing price of the San Francisco-based company of $90.74 on Aug. 14.

The deal is expected to complete in the fourth quarter of 2020. Shares in Sanofi were up fractionally higher at 0.23% in early European trading on Monday. \u201cWe like the relatively low risk value accretion of this deal with longer-term optionality, that fits within the strategy of deploying firepower across numerous bolt-on deals,\u201d analysts at Jefferies wrote n a research note on Monday. Hudson, who joined Sanofi from rival Swiss drugmaker Novartis NOVN, +0.77%, has been restructuring the French drugmaker into three main global business units: specialty care (immunology, rare diseases, rare blood disorders, neurology and oncology), vaccines, and general medicines (diabetes, cardiovascular, and established products) to simplify the business and help drive growth. Its consumer health-care division will be a stand-alone business unit. The company is aiming to make $2 billion in savings by 2022 through limiting spending on those deprioritized businesses, \u201csmart spending,\u201d and improving manufacturing productivity.
