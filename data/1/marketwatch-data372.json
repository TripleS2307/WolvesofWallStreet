Dalio explained in the interview that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an instinct to think that cash is the lowest risk asset, because it has less volatility, and also because we look at everything through the lens of cash \u00e2\u0080\u0093 what is everything in dollars worth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see it that way. Back in late January, Dalio made a similar call, saying \u00e2\u0080\u009ccash is trash,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which led to plenty of backlash amid reports that his flagship Pure Alpha Fund II was down double-digits as the broader market took a tumble. He stuck to his guns a few months later in a question-and-answer session on Reddit in April, even as the coronavirus pandemic cast dark clouds over the fate of the stock market. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe that increasingly there will be questions by bondholders who are receiving negative real and nominal interest rates, while there is a lot of printing of money, about whether the debt assets they are holding are good storeholds of wealth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said at the time. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe that cash, which is non-interest-bearing money, will not be the safest asset to hold.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Read: Investors could be looking at a \u00e2\u0080\u0098lost decade,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest hedge fund warns So what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an investor to do? Dalio said that China, where \u00e2\u0080\u009calmost everybody\u00e2\u0080\u009d is underweight, has fallen out of favor, but deserves more exposure, beginning with a diversified approach to investments in the region. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00c2 means to achieve the right kind of balance of assets in China,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told CNBC. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur approach is, we call it all-weather approach, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a certain balance in which you achieve balance without lowering the expected return.
