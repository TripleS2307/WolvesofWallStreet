Reuters said a filing in the coming weeks could set up a debut as soon as September, as the company has been encouraged by the recent boom in the IPO market by other Silicon Valley companies. The company is reportedly still mulling whether to go public via a traditional IPO or a direct listing. The highly secretive software company, last valued at around $20 billion in 2015, has been a top IPO candidate for years. It would likely face intense scrutiny for its sensitive data-mining work with the U.S. government."}]}
