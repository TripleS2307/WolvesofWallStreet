The low-cost carrier said it expects adjusted pretax loss--which strips out exceptional and other one-off items--for the year ending Sept. 30 to be in the 815 million pounds to 845 million pounds ($1.05 billion to $1.09 billion) range, compared with a profit of GBP427 million for fiscal 2019. Adjusted pretax loss consensus is GBP745.9 million, taken from FactSet and based on 10 analysts' forecasts. The company said it will book a nonheadline charge of around GBP120 million, taken in the second half relating to restructuring. Passenger numbers for the period fell 50% to 48 million, in line with a fall in capacity of 48%, to 55 million seats. Load factor for the year fell 4.3 percentage points to 87.2%, the company said. The budget airline said that it has successfully concluded consultations with U.K. cabin crew and pilots, and that this has resulted in greatly increased seasonal and flexible working patterns, avoiding the need for compulsory redundancies. It added that consultation processes in Germany, Portugal and Switzerland are continuing. The airline said that, based on current travel restrictions, it expects to fly at around 25% of planned capacity for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. It added that it will retain the flexibility to ramp up capacity quickly when demand returns. The company said that early booking levels for summer 2021 are in line with previous years. \"At this stage, given the continued level of short-term uncertainty, it would not be appropriate to provide any financial guidance for the 2021 financial year,\" the company said."}]}
