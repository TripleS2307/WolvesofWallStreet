Revenue tumbled to C$26.1 million from C$71.1 million, compared with a C$20.5 million FactSet consensus. Direct-to-consumer sales fell to C$10.4 million from C$34.8 million, driven by temporary store closures and reduced store hours due to COVID-19. \"New openings this year will be concentrated in Mainland China, where the recovery of traffic remains ahead of other markets,\" the company said in a statement. \"With international tourism now heavily constrained, serving the world's largest luxury consumer base at home is increasingly crucial.\" The company is expecting a 'significant revenue decline' in its fiscal second quarter and is not providing guidance for the full year, given the uncertainty created by the pandemic. Shares have fallen 31.5% in the year to date, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% has gained 4%."}]}
