LI, -1.84% skyrocketed nearly 50% to trade above $16 on Thursday after pricing their initial public offering at $11.50 an ADS. Li last week set an IPO range between $8 and $10. The company sold 95 million ADS to raise $1.093 billion. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and UBS are among the underwriters. Li's IPO comes on the heels of recent IPO successes for electric-vehicle makers such as Nikola Corp. NKLA, -1.36% and a continued share rally for Tesla Inc. TSLA, +1.89%. In its prospectus, Li said it had started volume production of its first model, an SUV called Li One, last year, and that it has delivered more than 10,400 Li One vehicles as of June 30. Li said it focuses on SUVs costing between $21,000 and $70,000, seeking to offer customers \"unparalleled value for money with the performance, functionality, and cabin-space of a large premium SUV but pricing close to a compact premium SUV.\""}]}
