Men in the U.S. report less intention than women to wear face coverings, especially in counties that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mandate wearing them, according to a paper authored by researchers from Middlesex University London in the U.K. and the Mathematical Science Research Institute in Berkeley, Calif. This, the authors say, suggests that making face coverings mandatory \u00e2\u0080\u009chas a larger effect on men than on women.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u201c Men appear to be more severely impacted by the virus: In places such as China, Italy, Spain and New York City, men have died from COVID-19 at far higher rates than women. \u201d Men are also less likely to believe they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be seriously impacted by COVID-19, despite data to the contrary, the research found. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe fact that men less than women intend to wear a face covering can be partly explained by the fact that men more than women believe that they will be relatively unaffected by the disease,\u00e2\u0080\u009d co-authors Valerio Capraro and H\u00c3\u00a9l\u00c3\u00a8ne Barcelo wrote. This finding is \u00e2\u0080\u009cparticularly ironic,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they said, as men appear to be more severely impacted by the virus: In places such as China, Italy, Spain and New York City, men have died from COVID-19 at far higher rates than women. The study also found that men are more likely to report feeling negative emotions while wearing a face covering. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMen more than women agree that wearing a face covering is shameful, not cool, a sign of weakness, and a stigma; and these gender differences also mediate gender differences intentions to wear a face covering,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Capraro and Barcelo wrote. That finding, they said, indicates that interventions to promote men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use of face coverings should work to decrease those emotions.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently recommend that everyone wear a cloth face covering (and not a medical-grade mask meant for a health-care worker) over their nose and mouth when they go out in public. A separate study distributed by the National Bureau of Economic Research this month found that women are more likely to view the coronavirus as \u00e2\u0080\u009ca very serious health problem\u00e2\u0080\u009d and more likely to agree with activity-restraining rules to prevent the virus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spread, including closing non-essential shops, postponing elections and mandating face-mask use in public. Women are also more likely to comply with public-health measures such as mask-wearing, hand-washing and coughing into one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s elbow, according to the study, which analyzed data from 21,649 respondents in eight OECD countries. The study was conducted across two waves in March and April. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur results may help to explain, at least in part, the gender differences that have emerged in mortality and vulnerability to COVID-19,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the authors wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy being more careful and compliant with the rules indicated by the [World Health Organization] and by public authorities, women reduce the risk of being severely affected by COVID-19. Moreover, being more concerned, women may also be less reluctant than men to seek health care early on, when the first symptoms appear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Also see:Mike Pence acknowledges he made a mistake by visiting patients without a mask, but health-care workers say Mayo Clinic has serious soul-searching to do Other surveys have shown men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relative reluctance to don face coverings to protect against COVID-19: One Gallup/Knight Foundation poll conducted April 14 to 20, for example, found that 29% of men said they had \u00e2\u0080\u009calways\u00e2\u0080\u009d worn a mask or cloth face covering outside their home in the past seven days, compared to 44% of women. \u201c Women were reportedly more likely to wear face masks during both the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong and the H1N1 outbreak, according to a 2014 literature review. \u201d Gender differences in protective measures against respiratory infections also have some historic precedent: Women were reportedly more likely to wear face masks during both the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong and the H1N1 outbreak, according to a 2014 literature review published in the Singapore Medical Journal. (In at least two other studies included in the review, meanwhile, gender did not appear to play a role in mask-wearing behavior.) \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith regard to gender, it has been postulated that women are generally less willing to take risks, and are thus more compliant with preventive behavior than their male counterparts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the authors wrote. The 1918 influenza pandemic presented an opportunity for public-health authorities \u00e2\u0080\u009cto advance a more manly style of health education,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to a 2010 historical analysis of public-health lessons gleaned from the pandemic that killed an estimated 50 million worldwide. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSome in the public health field felt that older forms of public outreach were too old-fashioned to reach the modern men and boys who now posed a special weakness in the chain of infection control,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the author wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe influenza pandemic offered a teaching moment in which masculine resistance to hygiene rules associated with mothers, school marms, and Sunday school teachers could be replaced with a more modern, manly form of public health,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added, \u00e2\u0080\u009csteeped in discipline, patriotism, and personal responsibility.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This story was originally published May 14, 2020, and has been updated."}]}
