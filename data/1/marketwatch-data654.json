Though PayPal PYPL, +2.18% has offered a number of other consumer credit programs over the years that will continue to exist, the company\u2019s new Pay in 4 option in the U.S. lets it offer interest-free installments, which have become increasingly popular through companies like Klarna and Afterpay that also let online shoppers split purchases into four pieces. PayPal argues that the company\u2019s service is differentiated in part because it will come \u201cat no additional cost\u201d to PayPal merchants beyond the typical fees that these sellers already incur for the company\u2019s traditional payment processing services, according to Doug Bland, the company\u2019s senior vice president for global credit.

PayPal CEO: \u2018I don\u2019t think there is any going back\u2019 from e-commerce after COVID-19 The Pay in 4 offering will be available for purchases between $30 and $600 and span a six-week period. The first installment is due at the time of purchase and shoppers won\u2019t incur fees if they make their payments on time. Bland said PayPal merchants that have offered general \u201cmessaging\u201d on their sites about the ability for shoppers to pay over time have seen increased average order values. \u201cWe see this as a rising tide for everyone,\u201d he told MarketWatch. The new installment offering will be integrated with the existing PayPal system and it will appear as an option in U.S. users\u2019 PayPal wallets. The company already offers a pay-after-delivery feature for shoppers in Canada, Australia, France, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands and the U.K. PayPal\u2019s stock has surged 89% over the past six months as the pandemic has driven a surge in online payments.
