I was stunned, as we had been meeting for six months and all this time he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d talked a good game about his investments doing well. The surprising thing? Phil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s retirement money had been in mutual funds for 10 years. When he came to me for advice, he said his retirement funds were fine, but his wife wanted a professional\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opinion on both their retirement plan and her own 401(k).\u00c2 \u00c2 My mind flashed back to a conversation a few years ago with a friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father who was a stockbroker.\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cMen don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like to ask questions, especially to other men,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told me.\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to appear stupid.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00c2 Indeed, most men are bigger risk takers when it comes to lifestyle and money.\u00c2 Riskier jobs result in higher injuries and require more expensive disability insurance. Men typically are faster drivers and pursue more life-threatening hobbies, which means more expensive life insurance expenses.\u00c2 These costs add up. Moreover, men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s penchant for do-it-yourself investing often leads to more of a sporting mentality:\u00c2 watching, cheering and reacting to the stock market.\u00c2 In contrast, women tend to be more \u00e2\u0080\u009cset it and forget it\u00e2\u0080\u009d investors. Even women money managers switch their investments less often than their male peers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and do just fine in terms of portfolio return. \u201c Men might want to act more like women \u00e2\u0080\u0094 at least around personal finances. \u201d With that in mind, men might want to act more like women \u00e2\u0080\u0094 at least around personal finances. Some reasons: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00e2\u0080\u0089 Women are less afraid to ask questions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 64% of men invest without seeking professional advice whereas 33% of women do so.\u00c2 Men consider investing a subject they understand without guidance or help. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00e2\u0080\u0089Women do just as well with investing as men, though typically they feel less confident about it.\u00c2 Women investors actually fared better than their male peers during the Great Recession in 2008. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00e2\u0080\u0089Men mistake action for progress. Men take on more credit cards, trade frequently and shoulder more debt.\u00c2 Many men have a goal of making money quickly, but they often are reluctant to sell what they insist is a \u00e2\u0080\u009csure thing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2 Though women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial actions and savings vary with marital status and age, they tend to be well-rounded and quiet when spending. Additionally, women give more to charity, make smaller purchases and prioritize a family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long-term goals.\u00c2 Men tend to spend money to impress, but these\u00c2 grand gestures\u00c2 lead to greater expenses and more debt. When it comes to impulse buys, men and women are equally susceptible, though women spend less per purchase. Read: How to plan for the unique financial challenges women face If men are to be more like women around money, here are some good places to start: 1. Seek expert investment advice. 2. Take less risk. 3. Reduce impulse purchases and overall spending. As for Phil,\u00c2 I explained what a mutual fund is and what types of funds he and his wife Mary owned. Mary asked if these investments were risky and how well she and Phil were prepared for retirement.\u00c2 Looking at their combined portfolio, it became clear that while Phil was taking on more risk, Mary was much more conservative. Together their investments were in balance, which only shows that when it comes to money, men and women can learn from each other.\u00c2 More: \u00c2 Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the real difference between women and men when it comes to stock-market investing"}]}
