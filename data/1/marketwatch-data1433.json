The S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% finished up a modest 8 points, or 0.2%, at 3,390 (on a preliminary basis, rounded). It has taken the broad-market benchmark 126 trading sessions to finish at a new record after falling by at least 20%, which defines a bear market. Gains on Tuesday were driven by a surge in consumer-discretionary shares, up 1.5%, and communication services, rising 1.1%. The record for the S&P 500 came as the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.39% notched its own record close and its 34th for 2020. The Nasdaq closed up 0.7% at 11,210. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% finished the session off 0.2% at 27,777. All closing levels are on a preliminary basis. The records for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq come, however, even as millions of Americans are out of work due to the coronavirus pandemic. \"Many continue to wonder why stocks are at new highs with 10% unemployment and nearly a million people filing for initial unemployment claims. The truth is economic data is backward looking and stocks are looking ahead to a much brighter future,\" wrote Ryan Detrick, chief investment strategist at LPL Financial. \"From a 34% bear market to new highs, 2020 is record breaking and heartbreaking all at the same time,\" he wrote."}]}
