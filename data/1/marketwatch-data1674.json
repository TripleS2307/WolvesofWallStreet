Cahall also argued that the pandemic has shaken up the traditional ad-buying process and the customary tradition in TV media in which many ads are purchased \"upfront\" over the summer in anticipation of the television season beginning in the fall. \"With Roku being able to negotiate for more premium impressions we believe there are now precedent conditions for [connected TV] to become more common in brand building ad campaigns - a space traditionally occupied by content networks,\" he wrote, while setting a $215 price target on the shares. Roku's stock has rallied 49% over the past three months as the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% has risen 3.7%."}]}
