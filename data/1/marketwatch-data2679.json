Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another thought. The recent pattern may be more than just the normal course of business \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and perhaps something to pay attention to. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter that whippy rally out of nowhere yesterday, I started to think how the current market pattern of instability and volatility is so much like what we saw back in January and February of this year,\u00e2\u0080\u009d wrote David Rosenberg, a long-time strategist now running his own firm, Rosenberg Research. Rosenberg is often known as a bear, and he has had a glass-half-full view through most of this year. But he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also known for predicting the subprime mortgage crisis, even while working for one of the biggest enablers \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and victims \u00e2\u0080\u0093 of the bubble, Merrill Lynch.

Rosenberg also points out that markets \u00e2\u0080\u009ctanked\u00e2\u0080\u009d in February, but only ended up \u00e2\u0080\u009cbottoming when the Fed and the Treasury and Congress teamed up to engage in the most intense policy easing of all time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Veteran investors sometimes like to associate the bond market with signals and stocks with noise. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } But Rosenberg thinks recent stock-market choppiness should be a reason to worry. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDoes this behavior look normal to you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAny reason, you think, for all this volatility? Could it be a signal that something is lurking around the corner?\u00e2\u0080\u009d It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not clear what that \u00e2\u0080\u009csomething\u00e2\u0080\u009d could be, although there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a long list of headwinds, from the U.S. presidential election to a no-deal Brexit to the seemingly endless string of natural disasters. And underneath it all are rising global COVID-19 case counts that could swamp health systems and sap economies \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which forecasters expect to only get worse with the return of winter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFatigue has set in, people are getting sloppy, but the impact on economic activity is still one of a drag,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rosenberg wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd as we go into fall and then winter, this situation can only get worse. And the market gyrations, as at the turn of the year, are telling you get out of Dodge \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as in, de-risk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Read next: \u00e2\u0080\u0098The stock market no longer thinks it needs the economy if it has the Fed,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 David Rosenberg says"}]}
