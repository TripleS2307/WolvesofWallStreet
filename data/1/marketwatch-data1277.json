The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats \u00e2\u0080\u0094 stocks of 65 companies that have increased their dividends for at least 25 years \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have been solid, in that none of them have cut their payouts. You might be thinking: Isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that what they are supposed to do? Yes. But if you look at the components of the benchmark S&P 500 Index US:SPX, 63 companies have cut or suspended their dividends this year. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 14% of the non-Aristocrats. They are listed below, and the year-to-date returns are ugly. Of 63 dividend cutters, 56 have suffered double-digit declines (with dividends reinvested), and 49 are down at least 20%. Among the 65 components of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index XX:SP50DIV, gainers and decliners are pretty much evenly split for 2020, with 33 showing positive returns through Aug. 21. The entire \u00c2 S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index is down 2.4% this year, which may seem a poor showing against the 6.5% return for the broader S&P 500 Index. However, large technology companies that dominate the benchmark index have had an outsized effect on its market-capitalization-weighted performance. In the U.S. financial media, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbig tech\u00e2\u0080\u009d pretty much means the FAANG stocks and Microsoft Corp. US:MSFT. This group is on fire this year and carries a tremendous weighting in the S&P 500, but only two of them are in the information technology sector, as defined by S&P Dow Jones Indices: Company Ticker Total return - 2020 Market capitalization ($ billion) Facebook Inc.

US:MSFT 36% $1,612 Source: FactSet Together, the FAANG + Microsoft group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s combined $7.24 trillion in market capitalization makes up 25.8% of the cap-weighted S&P 500. So, no, your index fund is not as diversified as you may think. So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no surprise that the tech-heavy S&P 500 has been outperforming the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats for many years. But if you look back 15 years, the story changes: Over 15 years, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index has beaten the performance of the full S&P 500 Index. FactSet One way to invest in the entire Aristocrats group is the ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats US:NOBL. \u00c2 The Dividend Aristocrats list An S&P 500 stock is considered a Dividend Aristocrat if it has raised its dividend payout on common shares for at least 25 consecutive years. It makes no difference how high a stock\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current dividend yield might be. S&P Dow Jones Indices will include a newly formed company as a Dividend Aristocrat if it was formed through a merger that included a company that was already an Aristocrat and it continues raising its dividend. Here are all 65 S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, sorted by current yield, with total returns for 2020 through Aug. 21 (scroll the table to the right to see the yields and returns): Company Ticker Industry Dividend yield Total return - 2020 Exxon Mobil Corp.

Despite no dividend cuts among the group this year, they are a possibility. For example, Exxon Mobil Corp. US:XOM \u00c2 decided in April to leave its quarterly dividend (paid in May) unchanged, when it traditionally raises the dividend at that time each year. Unless the company makes a move later this year, it will no longer be an Aristocrat. Dividend cuts for Exxon and Chevron Corp. US:CVX have traditionally seemed \u00e2\u0080\u009cvirtually unthinkable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov said in March. Sure enough, Exxon has shown a real commitment to maintaining the current payout by taking drastic measures to preserve cash during the extended period of low fuel demand. These measures include a suspension of matching 401(k) contributions for its employees. So you need to do your own research before considering a Dividend Aristocrat, or any other company, for investment.Dividend cutters Here are all 63 companies among the S&P 500 that have suspended or lowered their dividend payments this year.
