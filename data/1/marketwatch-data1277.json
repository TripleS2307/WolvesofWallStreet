The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats - stocks of 65 companies that have increased their dividends for at least 25 years - have been solid, in that none of them have cut their payouts. You might be thinking: Isn't that what they are supposed to do? Yes. But if you look at the components of the benchmark S&P 500 Index US:SPX, 63 companies have cut or suspended their dividends this year. That's 14% of the non-Aristocrats. They are listed below, and the year-to-date returns are ugly. Of 63 dividend cutters, 56 have suffered double-digit declines (with dividends reinvested), and 49 are down at least 20%. Among the 65 components of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index XX:SP50DIV, gainers and decliners are pretty much evenly split for 2020, with 33 showing positive returns through Aug. 21. The entire  S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index is down 2.4% this year, which may seem a poor showing against the 6.5% return for the broader S&P 500 Index. However, large technology companies that dominate the benchmark index have had an outsized effect on its market-capitalization-weighted performance. In the U.S. financial media, \"big tech\" pretty much means the FAANG stocks and Microsoft Corp. US:MSFT. This group is on fire this year and carries a tremendous weighting in the S&P 500, but only two of them are in the information technology sector, as defined by S&P Dow Jones Indices: Company Ticker Total return - 2020 Market capitalization ($ billion) Facebook Inc. Class A US:FB 30% $642 Apple Inc. US:AAPL 71% $2,127 Amazon.com Inc. US:AMZN 78% $1,645 Netflix Inc. US:NFLX 52% $217 Alphabet Inc. Class C US:GOOG 18% $527 Alphabet Inc. Class A US:GOOGL 18% $473 Microsoft Corp. US:MSFT 36% $1,612 Source: FactSet Together, the FAANG + Microsoft group's combined $7.24 trillion in market capitalization makes up 25.8% of the cap-weighted S&P 500. So, no, your index fund is not as diversified as you may think. So it's no surprise that the tech-heavy S&P 500 has been outperforming the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats for many years. But if you look back 15 years, the story changes: Over 15 years, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index has beaten the performance of the full S&P 500 Index. FactSet One way to invest in the entire Aristocrats group is the ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats US:NOBL.  The Dividend Aristocrats list An S&P 500 stock is considered a Dividend Aristocrat if it has raised its dividend payout on common shares for at least 25 consecutive years. It makes no difference how high a stock's current dividend yield might be. S&P Dow Jones Indices will include a newly formed company as a Dividend Aristocrat if it was formed through a merger that included a company that was already an Aristocrat and it continues raising its dividend. Here are all 65 S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, sorted by current yield, with total returns for 2020 through Aug. 21 (scroll the table to the right to see the yields and returns): Company Ticker Industry Dividend yield Total return - 2020 Exxon Mobil Corp.

Despite no dividend cuts among the group this year, they are a possibility. For example, Exxon Mobil Corp. US:XOM  decided in April to leave its quarterly dividend (paid in May) unchanged, when it traditionally raises the dividend at that time each year. Unless the company makes a move later this year, it will no longer be an Aristocrat. Dividend cuts for Exxon and Chevron Corp. US:CVX have traditionally seemed \"virtually unthinkable,\" as Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov said in March. Sure enough, Exxon has shown a real commitment to maintaining the current payout by taking drastic measures to preserve cash during the extended period of low fuel demand. These measures include a suspension of matching 401(k) contributions for its employees. So you need to do your own research before considering a Dividend Aristocrat, or any other company, for investment.Dividend cutters Here are all 63 companies among the S&P 500 that have suspended or lowered their dividend payments this year.
