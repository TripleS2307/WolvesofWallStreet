In their discussions, reflected in the minutes from the central bank\u2019s meeting on July 28-19 published a half-hour after Comex metals settled on Wednesday, Fed officials said there had been an increase in uncertainty about the economic outlook since their prior meeting in mid-June. \u201cWe are at a very vulnerable spot, and I don\u2019t know what the next shoe to drop will be,\u201d said Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin, in comments on Wednesday after the release of minutes. However, the decision to hold off on implementing so-called yield-curve control, has been interpreted by some as not as dovish a message from the Fed as had been hoped, which nudged the dollar higher and weighed on bullion. A measure of the U.S. dollar, the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, -0.58%, has been trading on either side of unchanged on Thursday after a roughly 0.5% gain on Wednesday for the gauge against a half-dozen currencies. The dollar had hit its lowest print since 2018 last week. A firmer dollar can undercut the appeal of buying gold for overseas buyers. \u201cThe rebound in the US dollar has also sparked a fresh bout of weakness in gold prices which sold off sharply and are now testing support at the $1,920 an ounce, and the renewed uncertainty over the pace of further monetary stimulus from the Federal Reserve,\u201d wrote Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK. On Thursday, December gold GCZ20, +2.17% GC00, +2.17% settled $23.80, or 1.2%, at $1,946.50, after declining 2.1% on Wednesday. Meanwhile, September silver prices US:SIU20 shed 19.3 cents, or less than 0.7%, to end at $27.147 an ounce, after gold\u2019s sister commodity declined 2.6% in the previous session. Gold and silver initially added to their declines after U.S. economic reports came in worse than expected. A weekly jobless benefit-claims report and a reading of manufacturing activity in the Philadelphia area, the Philly Fed index, pointed to signs of a weakening recovery in employment and growth in the COVID-19 era. Elsewhere on Comex, September copper US:HGU20 lost 4.85 cents, or 1.6%, to settle at $2.9745 a pound, a day after the industrial metal finished at a two-year high. Meanwhile, October platinum PLV20, +3.99% declined $29.40, or 3.1%, to close at $926.90 an ounce, while September US:PAU20 picked up $7.80, or 0.4%, to settle at $2,186.90 an ounce."}]}
