Opinion:Key lessons on voting by mail \u2014 from a state that has only voted that way for decades Barr also suggested that China poses a greater threat to election security than Russia, aligning himself with Trump and Republican allies seeking to present that as a central conclusion of an official intelligence assessment last month, which in fact found that, while China and Iran have shown an interest in the Nov. 3 presidential election \u2014 with China believed to favor Biden because of the perceived chaos in bilateral relations under Trump \u2014 it is Russia that is again engaged in active measures against American democracy.

The five states that relied on mail-in ballots even before the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington and Utah \u2014 have said they have necessary safeguards in place to ensure against fraud and to prevent hostile foreign actors from co-opting the vote. More states intend to rely more heavily on mail-in voting this fall because of the pandemic. The attorney general cited a report from more than a decade ago from a commission led by former President Jimmy Carter and former Secretary of State James Baker that said vote-by-mail was vulnerable to fraud. But the commission pointed out in a statement in May that it had found little evidence of fraud in states like Oregon that had sufficient safeguards.

Associated Press Barr also said he was basing on \u201clogic\u201d his concern that a hostile foreign actor could produce bogus ballots for the election. But senior U.S. officials said on a conference call with reporters last week that they had no intelligence to suggest that was happening. Barr, on the question of whether Russia, China or Iran, has been most assertive in interfering in the election: \u201cI believe it\u2019s China.\u201d The facts: Barr\u2019s assessment does not line up with last month\u2019s formal statement from the government\u2019s counterintelligence chief, William Evanina. The statement directly implicated Russia in 2020 election interference by saying it was actively working to denigrate Biden. Its characterization of China\u2019s activities was considerably more nebulous, however, saying it regards Trump as unpredictable and prefers that he not win. The statement said intelligence officials believed China has been expanding \u201cits influence efforts\u201d to shape the policy environment ahead of the November election and will continue to weigh the risks and benefits of aggressive action. But they did not specifically place China as a more serious threat or allege that Beijing was directly interfering in the election.
