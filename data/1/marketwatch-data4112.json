The dip in housing starts was driven by a 25% decline in multifamily construction activity. Permitting activity occurred at a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 1.47 million, down 1% from July but roughly even with the pace from August 2019. Economists polled by MarketWatch had expected housing starts to occur at a pace of 1.52 million and building permits to come in at a pace of 1.55 million."}]}
