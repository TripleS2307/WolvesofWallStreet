In fact, he warned in a note posted on LinkedIn that we could be looking at a \u00e2\u0080\u009cPortnoy Top\u00e2\u0080\u009d in this market. \u00e2\u0080\u009c[Portnoy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s] attention-getting, wild style is emblematic of just how emotional and extreme equity markets are now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s both impulsive and compulsive. His behavior really just explains everything. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even matter if he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s serious or not.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cecchini isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the only one raising a red flag on Portnoy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s antics: iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Regardless of whether Portnoy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just engaging in his latest attention grab, he represents a groundswell of retail investors emboldened by the current climate of staying at home, free-flowing Fed money and easy access through platforms like Robinhood, Cecchini wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an unholy speculative mix,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not about him; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about what the rants represent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cecchini\u00e2\u0080\u0099s takeaway is that the stock market is no place to be at the moment, even with some of the recent spikes investors have seen of late. On Friday, the Dow DJIA, +0.56% bounced back from a day-earlier decline of nearly 2,000 points with a 477-point rally, and both the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% and Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39% also logged gains. Still, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to get ugly out there, Cecchini warns. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s absolutely no reason to own U.S. equities right now \u00e2\u0080\u0094 unless one likes low to negative future returns.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In Monday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trading action, the major indexes managed to bounce off the lows of the session, but the Nasdaq was the only one in positive territory, at last check."}]}
