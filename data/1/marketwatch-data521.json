The deal, which implies an enterprise value of $3.7 billion, is expected to provide Clover with up to $1.2 billion in cash proceeds, including a fully committed PIPE (private investment in public equity) of $400 million and up to $828 million of cash held in a trust account of Social Capital.

The Clover team empowers physicians to deliver the best possible outcomes for our members, and the Clover Assistant does just that by delivering vital clinical insights to physicians at the point of care .\u201d The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021. The companies did not provide a proposed ticker symbol that combined company will trade under.
