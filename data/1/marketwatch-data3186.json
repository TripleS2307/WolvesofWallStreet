Once the coronavirus pandemic fades \u2014 whenever that happens \u2014 two health trends for America\u2019s older adults seem nearly unquestionable. Medical appointments through telehealth will be common, especially for those on Medicare. And the need for geriatricians will be great. Since people over 65 have accounted for roughly 80% of the COVID-19 deaths in the U.S, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the older adult population has been at the heart of the pandemic. Here\u2019s what experts forecast regarding telehealth and physicians specializing in geriatrics post-pandemic:Telehealth In 2019, only 11% of U.S. consumers used telehealth \u2014 medical appointments via video or telephone \u2014 according to McKinsey & Company Health Care Systems and Services. But in recent months, McKinsey says, 46% have. Partly, the growth in telehealth has come because so many Americans haven\u2019t been allowed into their doctors\u2019 offices. Partly, doctors have come to embrace these types of appointments. But a key factor has been Medicare rule changes covering telehealth for people 65 and older in important ways.

Before that, they had to either live in a rural area or go to a clinic, hospital or certain other types of medical facilities.

Pre-COVID-19, telehealth through Medicare also required interactive audio and video between the practitioner and the patient; now, audio alone is allowed. Medicare has recently more than doubled the number of services beneficiaries can receive through telehealth \u2014 adding 135, including physical, occupational and speech therapy services. The result of all this? Before the pandemic, about 13,000 people in fee-for-service Medicare received telehealth in a week. These days, roughly 1.7 million do. Over 9 million Medicare beneficiaries have received a telehealth service during the pandemic. Private Medicare Advantage plans can now offer the latest telehealth technology as part of their basic benefit, too. Now, more than half of those plans do, for up to 13.7 million enrollees. Said Seema Verma, administrator for the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, in a July 15, 2020 Health Affairs blog about Medicare\u2019s telehealth expansion: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine merely reverting to the way things were before.\u201d Rep. Kevin Brady, the lead Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, is currently drafting legislation to make permanent Medicare\u2019s telehealth changes created in the pandemic. Penny Shaffer, South Florida market president of Florida Blue, the state\u2019s oldest and largest health insurer, says the increase in telehealth for older adults has been the biggest health care impact of COVID-19 for them. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to say for the convenience of interacting with a provider from the comfort of your home: it\u2019s safer in many ways, given no travel or transport is required, and there\u2019s no interaction with other patients in waiting rooms,\u201d she notes. But, as Judith Graham of Kaiser Health News recently wrote, not all Americans have access to technology or can afford tech devices. Some have health issues (like dementia, hearing loss and impaired vision) preventing them from using telehealth. And some need translation services. Read: How to get the most out of a telehealth appointment: 9 tips Mario Schlosser, CEO of the tech-focused health insurer Oscar, noted that the total number of health visits by his policyholders during the pandemic has dropped in half. Shaffer, of Florida Blue, acknowledges that while telehealth isn\u2019t the right method for every condition, patient or situation, \u201cthere are a number of encounters that can be satisfied with a telehealth visit.\u201d Florida Blue, like other health insurers, envisions even greater use of technology and virtual visits in the future to monitor patients with chronic conditions and as a postsurgical tool, to reduce the risk of infection. That prediction was echoed by Catherine McCallum, a clinical social worker and aging care management consultant who runs Coral Life Strategies in Bethesda, Md. Also see: Why older Americans are more likely to be harmed by medical care McCallum also likes telehealth patients\u2019 ability to schedule appointments quickly, rather than having to wait too long for an appointment. \u201cBut,\u201d she adds, \u201cnot all medical practices set up their own secure line; some rely on Zoom ZM, +2.89% or another platform, which has shown to be less secure.\u201d McCallum says there can be other difficulties and limitations relying on video health visits, especially for counseling patients, too. \u201cRight now, when we speak with patients using applications like Zoom, especially older adults, we have to get very specific about what they need to do and how to interact with the computer or smartphone,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd we have to remind them to turn off other devices.\u201d However, McCallum is confident that older patients will increasingly become more comfortable with the technology \u2014 and that it will become more available and user friendly. As an insurer, the long-term financing of telehealth is very much a concern for Shaffer. She fears that post-COVID-19, Medicare reimbursement rates will return to paying doctors less for telehealth visits than in-person ones. Schlosser, of Oscar Health, feels that identical reimbursement rates for virtual and in-person visits will be unsustainable, but acknowledges that health providers will want to ensure they\u2019re compensated adequately for virtual visits. He also believes that once the pandemic crisis passes, people who pay for their own health care are likely to raise more questions about why doctors are charging the same for telehealth visits as for in-person visits since they don\u2019t always feel that they get the same level of service. And Robert Sullivan, a health care consultant and formerly the chief operations officer for Health Industries Advisory at the tax and consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, predicts that the greater use of technology for medical records during the pandemic will have a long-lasting, positive effect on health care costs due to better medical database management. \u201cFor the longest time,\u201d he says, \u201call your medical records were with your family physician. And if you needed to send information to a specialist or just needed to check on your own status, you had to get the information from your doctor. That was costly for the provider as well as for the insurance companies.\u201d But there\u2019s been a huge growth in the use of third-party data management of medical records during COVID-19. That portability, Sullivan believes, will save money for doctors\u2019 offices and insurers.Geriatric medicine \u201cThe big change for me as a result of COVID-19 is the heightened awareness of the need for more geriatric physicians,\u201d says Sullivan. \u201cWe\u2019re already woefully short of the number of geriatric physicians and that number is going to get even worse in the future.\u201d According to the American Geriatric Society, there are about 7,000 certified geriatricians in the United States. But the federal Health Resources & Services Administration, which tracks data on the workforce that\u2019s needed, estimates that by 2025, the U.S. needs to have close to 23,000 geriatric physicians to accommodate the number of boomers, who\u2019ll then be 61 to 79. Read: The case for defunding nursing homes and replacing them with a radically different model One of the reasons for this discrepancy: the expected income for those going in geriatrics. \u201cGeriatric medicine has not been the most lucrative specialty,\u201d Sullivan says. The American Geriatric Society reports that the average income for a geriatrician is lower than even for family practice, even though the specialty requires an additional year of schooling. According to ZipRecruiter, the average pay for a geriatrician in the U.S. is $198,740. By contrast, average pay for family physicians is about $208,000. Still, Sullivan says he\u2019s optimistic about future prospects for geriatricians. \u201cI think the pandemic put the spotlight on older adults, which will likely increase the number of people going into the field. And,\u201d he adds, \u201cit\u2019s also likely to increase the income for geriatric physicians as the demand becomes greater.\u201d Young people seem to agree. In his School of Aging Studies class at the University of Maryland Baltimore County, Prof. Steve Gurney, asked his young college students whether they thought there would be more emphasis in the health community on geriatric medicine in the post COVID-19 world. Almost all of the comments were similar to this one: \u201cCOVID-19 made us more aware of the health risk factors our elderly population faces. People, including myself, have kept our older generation in mind more now than ever before. And moving forward, people will have a better understanding of geriatric medicine and its importance.\u201d Bart Astor, an expert in life transitions and elder care, is the author of \u201cAARP Roadmap for the Rest of Your Life: Smart Choices About Money, Health, Work, Lifestyle and Pursuing Your Dreams\u201d and \u201cBaby Boomer\u2019s Guide to Caring for Aging Parents.\u201d His website is BartAstor.com and he can be reached at Bart@BartAstor.com. @bartastor This article is reprinted by permission from NextAvenue.org, \u00a9 2020 Twin Cities Public Television, Inc.
