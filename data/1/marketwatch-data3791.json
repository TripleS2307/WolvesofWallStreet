PINS, -0.50% are up 1.4% in Monday morning trading after Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak upgraded the stock to overweight from equal weight and raised his price target to $44 from $34. The company is \"driving/benefitting from accelerating e-commerce and social shopping,\" Nowak wrote in a note to clients. He likened Pinterest and Facebook Inc. FB, +0.26% to \"social online malls\" that could become increasingly important with the COVID-19 crisis changing the way people shop. Pinterest is the \"purest play\" on this trend, in Nowak's view, as the company saw a big surge in user growth in the second quarter and now is in a place to monetize this heightened engagement with better targeting capabilities and automatic bidding for traffic objectives. Such improvements helped drive \"structurally faster ad growth\" for Facebook, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +3.01%, and Snap Inc. SNAP, -0.18% in the past, and now Nowak expects that Pinterest could see similar trends. Pinterest shares have gained 79% over the past three months as the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% has increased 14%."}]}
