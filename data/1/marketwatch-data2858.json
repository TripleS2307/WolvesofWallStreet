How did benchmarks perform? The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% advanced 153.50 points, or 0.6%, to end at 26,024.96, after starting the session down nearly 204 points. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% rose 20.12 points, or 0.7%, to finish at 3,117.86, off its intraday low of 3,079.26, and powered by a 1.9% jump in information technology SP500.45, +1.54%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39% picked up 110.35 points, or 1.1%, closing at a record high of 10,056.47, while booking its seventh day in a row of gains and clinching its longest win streak since Dec. 26, 2019, according to Dow Jones Market Data. On Friday, the Dow booked a weekly gain of 1%, the S&P 500 gained 1.9%, and the Nasdaq returned 3.7%.What drove the market? High-flying technology companies that outshined the market during the pandemic helped propel major stock indexes higher on Monday, after the weekend saw cases of the disease caused by the novel strain of coronavirus pick up momentum as more U.S. states and businesses reopened. Investors still view local governments as reluctant to reinstitute restrictions on social activities or stall plans to ease lockdown measures further, as the economy shows signs of improvement from the depths of the COVID-19 crisis. \u201cVirus numbers are picking up,\u201d said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Robert W. Baird & Co. \u201cBut it\u2019s not to the extent that we\u2019re looking at a shutdown again.\u201d Bittles said investors have become upbeat about better-than-expected U.S. economic data and hopes that Congress will pass another nearly $1 trillion fiscal stimulus package this summer. \u201cThat\u2019s all a big positive for the economy,\u201d he said. Shares of Nike, Inc. NKE, +0.97% Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.74% and Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +2.48% led the Dow higher on Monday. U.S. stocks booked gains, despite briefly pulling back late in the session, following multiple reports that President Donald Trump plans to sign an executive order Monday to temporarily halt workers with visas in the H-1B category, and others, from coming to the U.S. amid the pandemic. The order also is expected to extend to January a pause on issuing \u201cgreen cards\u201d to new immigrants, an NPR report said. The World Health Organization on Sunday reported the largest single-day increase in global COVID-19 cases, more than 183,000, while South Korea on Monday declared its resurgence of the deadly virus a \u201csecond wave.\u201d Domestically, there are 24 states that showed an increasing trend in cases this past week, with California, Texas and Florida continuing to lead the way, each with more than 4,000 new cases on Sunday alone, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. The global tally for COVID-19 has topped 9 million. \u201cThe biggest uncertainty surrounds the potential for a renewed and sharp pick-up in COVID-19 cases,\u201d wrote Ben May, Oxford Economics\u2019 director of global macro research, in a note Monday. \u201cWhile concerns about a second wave have grown recently sparked by a rise in case numbers in some regions, it\u2019s too early to conclude that another wave is coming.\u201d New York City started allowing companies to reopen their offices Monday after a three-month lockdown because of the pandemic. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said the Trump administration is preparing for a second wave, but isn\u2019t anticipating one. \u201cWe don\u2019t necessarily expect a second wave, but prudence dictates that we plan for it. There is no contradiction,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday. A number of strategists, however, are betting that the economy will stage a sharp rebound out of recession, even as infections pick up. \u201cHistory is not on the side of investors expecting anything less than a V-shape,\u201d wrote analysts at Jefferies, led by global equity strategist Sean Darby, in a research note anticipating improvement in earnings as manufacturing data steadies from coronavirus lows. Looking ahead, the Federal Reserve will release the results of its annual stress tests on the nation\u2019s largest banks next Thursday. The Fed has conducted stress tests on the biggest banks every year since 2009 and this year is particularly important in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.
