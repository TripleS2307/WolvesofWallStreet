The city transport regulator Transport for London (TfL) had decided not to renew Uber\u2019s PHV operating license in November 2019, over concerns about its safety practices. TfL said it found several breaches that placed passengers at risk, including a change that allowed unauthorized drivers to upload their photos to other driver accounts. Another failure allowed dismissed or suspended drivers to create an Uber account and pick up passengers. Uber was allowed to continue operating, pending the appeal. Uber has since introduced a range of new safety measures in the app, including real-time identification checks for drivers. Following the successful appeal on Monday, Uber was granted a new 18-month license with 21 conditions attached, which were jointly proposed by Uber and TfL. These include verification of insurance documents as well as measures to prevent drivers from tampering with Uber\u2019s system. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com, said the decision was an important victory for the company and removes a significant regulatory overhang. \u201cBut the pandemic continues to exert an enormous drag on earnings and present management with a significant headache over the business model,\u201d Wilson said. However, he cautioned that this wasn\u2019t a permanent pass for the taxi-app. \u201cThe mayor of London indicated that Uber would face continuous scrutiny, whilst the company faces ongoing competition in the capital from the likes of India\u2019s Ola and Estonia\u2019s Bolt. But the decision today unquestionably is a good news story for Uber as it tries to stop its cash burn.\u201d Uber\u2019s problems with TfL date to 2017, when the regulator denied Uber a license, deeming it not \u2018fit and proper\u2019 to operate and saying it demonstrated a lack of corporate responsibility. That decision was overturned in 2018 after a judge concluded that new governance arrangements were sufficient and granted it a 15-month license to operate in London.

There is nothing more important than the safety of the people who use the Uber app as we work together to keep London moving,\u201d Jamie Heywood, Uber\u2019s regional general manager for northern & eastern Europe, said. Shares in Uber rose 3.5% in premarket U.S. trading to $35.67 on Monday. London, with around 3.5 million users and around 45,000 drivers, is Uber\u2019s largest market in Europe and has been dubbed one of the group\u2019s \u2018fab five\u2019 cities \u2014 along with New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles and S\u00e3o Paulo \u2014 which accounted for around a quarter of the company\u2019s global revenues before the coronavirus pandemic, according to Markets.com\u2019s Wilson. The Licensed Taxi Drivers\u2019 Association (LTDA), representing black-cab drivers, said the decision was a \u201cdisaster for London.\u201d \u201cUber has demonstrated time and time again that it simply can\u2019t be trusted to put the safety of Londoners, its drivers and other road users above profit. Sadly, it seems that Uber is too big to regulate effectively, but too big to fail,\u201d Steve McNamara, general secretary of the LTDA, said in a statement."}]}
