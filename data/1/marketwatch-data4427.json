His answer was no. But also, maybe. \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s certainly not the beginning of the end, but I would say we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re coming upon one of the more uncertain periods in American history. Markets don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like uncertainty.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d The Pershing Square Capital CEO explained in an interview with Bloomberg TV that the upcoming presidential election and the fracture that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already caused across the U.S. will only serve to create more uncertainty in the coming weeks and months. Most notably, tech stocks, with their \u00e2\u0080\u009cextraordinary\u00e2\u0080\u009d valuations could be vulnerable, he said. Apple AAPL, +1.74% and Tesla TSLA, +1.89% have been among the big leaders during the market rebound from the initial plunge in response to the coronavirus pandemic. But both were hit hard on Thursday. .wsj-interactive.generic-iframe-embed[name=\"\"] { height: 500px; margin-bottom: 5px; } .at16units .bleed .wsj-interactive.generic-iframe-embed[name=\"\"] { height: 500px; } body.at12units .bleed .wsj-interactive.generic-iframe-embed[name=\"\"] { height: 500px; } body .inline .wsj-interactive.generic-iframe-embed[name=\"\"], body .offset .wsj-interactive.generic-iframe-embed[name=\"\"], body .header .wsj-interactive.generic-iframe-embed[name=\"\"], body.at8units .bleed .wsj-interactive.generic-iframe-embed[name=\"\"] { height: 500px; } body.at4units .inline .wsj-interactive.generic-iframe-embed[name=\"\"], body.at4units .offset .wsj-interactive.generic-iframe-embed[name=\"\"], body.at4units .header .wsj-interactive.generic-iframe-embed[name=\"\"] { height: 500px; } While the broader decline was certainly a steep one, Ackman said it shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come as much of a surprise, considering how \u00e2\u0080\u009cremarkably strong\u00e2\u0080\u009d stocks have been since getting crushed in March. Read: Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one way to save capitalism, according to Ackman Earlier this year, Ackman was credited in\u00c2 an op-ed for the New York Times for nailing \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe single best trade of all time\u00e2\u0080\u009d when he set up a $27-million hedge against the market right before the March drop. Eventually, his relatively modest bearish bet turned into a $2.6-billion winner. Meawnhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% closed just off session lows but still finished down more than 800 points. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% shed 125 points, while the Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39% gave up 598 points."}]}
