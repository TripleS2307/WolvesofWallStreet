The CDC said a costume mask isn\u2019t a substitute for a cloth mask, and should not be used unless it is made of two or more layers of breathable fabric. The CDC recommended avoiding both traditional door-to-door trick-or-treating and trunk-and-treating, in which treats are handed from trunks of cars lined up in parking lots. The CDC said going to an indoor haunted house, attending crowded indoor costume parties and hayrides or tractor rides with people not in your household are also high-risk activities. Some moderate-risk activities are one-way trick-or-treating, in which goody bags are wrapped individually for people to grab and go; small, outdoor, open-air costume parade in which people are more than 6 feet apart; and having an outdoor Halloween movie night with local family friends, with people spaced at least 6 feet apart\u2014\u201cIf screaming will likely occur, greater distancing is advised.\u201d Lower-risk suggestions include carving pumpkins with members of your household, decorating your home or living space, having a virtual costume party and doing a scavenger hunt where children are given Halloween-themed things to look for while they walk outdoors \u201cadmiring Halloween decorations\u201d at a distance. \u2022 Italy has reportedly shut its borders with France, saying it will now require COVID-19 tests for those travelers. \u2022 As the U.K. settles in with new restrictions amid an increase in new cases, Prime Minister Boris Johnson suggested that the U.K. has a worse infection rate than Italy or Germany because it is a \u201cfreedom loving country.\u201dCOVID-19 leaders outside of the U.S. Brazil has the second highest death toll at 138,105 and third highest case tally at 4,591,364 million.
