Wells Chief Executive Charles Scharf said on the post-earnings conference call with Wall Street analysts that the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumers and the overall economy \u201csubstantially impacted\u201d results, as it led to the bank adding $8.4 billion to the allowance for credit losses. Scharf said the asset cap placed on the bank by the Federal Reserve also hurt, as the bank couldn\u2019t grow its balance sheet to offset the lower interest rate environment, which led to a 13% drop in net interest income. But for that, Scharf acknowledged that the bank couldn\u2019t blame anything but itself. \u201c[W]e are responsible for the position we\u2019re in,\u201d Scharf said, according to a FactSet transcript of the conference call. \u201c \u201cThe balance sheet cap exists because leadership failed to both oversee and build the appropriate infrastructure of the company and our financial underperformance is because leadership didn\u2019t make the difficult decisions necessary.\u201d \u201d \u2014 Wells Fargo Chief Executive Charles Scharf The Fed put the growth restrictions on Wells in response to sales practice scandals uncovered nearly four years ago, which led to billions of dollars in fines, the build out of new risk control models, and management and director house cleaning. That included the resignation in March 2019 of CEO Tim Sloan and the naming of Scharf as CEO last September. Also read: Fed says Wells Fargo isn\u2019t allowed to grow after wave of scandals. Don\u2019t miss: New Wells Fargo CEO says the bank\u2019s issues won\u2019t be fixed until 2021. And Scharf seemed determined not to make the same mistakes of his predecessors. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said and I\u2019ll say it again, we will not do anything that will impact the work we have under way to build out our risk and control environment,\u201d Scharf said. The stock WFC, was down as much as 8.2% at Tuesday\u2019s intraday low of $23.33, before bouncing to close down 4.6% at $24.25. It underperformed its large-capitalization peers and the broader stock market by wide margins, as the SPDR S&P Bank exchange-traded fund KBE, -0.69% slipped 1.6% and the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% gained 1.3%. Also weighing on the stock, besides just the bank\u2019s disappointing second-quarter results, was that Wells cut its quarterly dividend by 80% to 10 cents a share, from 51 cents a share, following the results of the Fed\u2019s annual stress tests of large U.S. banks.

Based on Tuesday\u2019s closing stock prices, the dividend cut reduces the implied dividend yield from 8.41% to 1.65%. That would knock Wells down from being the highest yielder among the SPDR bank ETF\u2019s components to 80th out of 87. In comparison, the yield for the bank ETF is 3.51% and the implied yield for the S&P 500 is 1.79%, according to FactSet. Scharf also warned that while the Fed\u2019s dividend payout limitation applies to the third quarter, the Fed reserves the right to extend the limitations as it learns more about the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on bank balance sheets.The disappointing numbers Before Tuesday\u2019s open, Wells reported that it swung to a second-quarter net loss of $2.69 billion, or 66 cents a share, from net income of $5.85 billion, or $1.30 a share, in the same period a year ago. The FactSet consensus was for a much narrower loss of 16 cents a share. Total revenue fell 17% to $17.84 billion, with net interest income dropping 18% to $9.9 billion to miss the FactSet consensus of $10.3 billion, and non-interest income declining 16% to $8.0 billion to miss expectations of $8.1 billion. Net interest margin fell to 2.25% from 2.82%, below the FactSet consensus of 2.33%. \u201cWe are extremely disappointed in both our second quarter results and our intent to reduce our dividend,\u201d Scharf said in a statement. \u201cOur view of the length and severity of the economic downturn has deteriorated considerably from the assumptions used last quarter, which drove the $8.4 billion addition to our credit loss reserve in the second quarter.\u201d The stock has tumbled 19.7% over the past three months, making it the worst performer among the SPDR bank ETF\u2019s components over that time period. Meanwhile, the bank ETF has gained 2.8% over the past three months and the S&P 500 has climbed 12.4%."}]}
