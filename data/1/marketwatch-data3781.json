Andrew Cuomo said in a news conference Thursday. In the last two weeks, the infection rate has risen 4 points for people between 21 and 30 years old, from 9.9% to 13.2%, he announced. It is the only age group in which infection rates increased in that time period. Calling the uptick a \u201cthreat\u201d to the state, Cuomo pointed to large gatherings at bars and a lack of social distancing as causes, as he has regularly done over the past week. \u201cThis is not the time to fight for your right to party,\u201d Cuomo said, quoting the 1980s Beastie Boys hit. \u201cI respect your right to party...but let\u2019s be smart about it. There\u2019s an attitude that young people are immune. You are not.\u201d Doctors have noticed the shift in the age of COVID-19 patients, according to Dr. Daniel Griffin, a practicing physician and an associate research scientist in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics at Columbia University. \u201cThe dynamic of the younger population has to do with behavior,\u201d he told MarketWatch. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing lots of young people out with large social circles interacting and we\u2019re seeing spread within those communities.\u201d Across the general population, there were 811 new cases of the virus reported Wednesday, with an infection rate of about 1.16%, Cuomo said in the news conference. There were 706 new hospitalizations, the lowest number since March 18, and 13 fatalities. In total, there have been nearly 410,000 reported cases of the virus in New York and 25,081 deaths. Coronavirus update:Global COVID-19 cases top 15 million as U.S. edges closer to 4 million, and California has more cases than New York Cuomo has called on local law enforcement to keep large gatherings at bars at bay, and earlier this week announced liquor licenses have been suspended for a number of establishments who have not complied with state guidelines. On Thursday, he also called on local police to enforce mandates against such gatherings. \u201cNew York City has to enforce the law,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cThe state liquor authority and the state police are going to step up their efforts dramatically, but they can\u2019t do it without the local police.\u201d Mayor Bill de Blasio has also expressed concern about the uptick in cases in this age group. Last week he announced that positive cases of the virus in 20- to 29-year-olds rose from 26.6 for every 100,000 people the first week of June, to 34.6 the week ending June 27. Still, the city is seeing the lowest number of new cases of the virus since the pandemic began. In addition, there hasn\u2019t been an uptick in the infection rate since the city started reopening, the mayor said Thursday during his daily briefing. Read: Next coronavirus aid package may not become reality until second week of August, analysts say De Blasio also announced four new testing sites in the city, and that NYC Health + Hospitals sites can now test up to 50,000 people a day. There have been a total of 219,489 reported cases of the virus in New York City, as well as 18,839 confirmed deaths and 4,624 probable deaths, according to city data."}]}
