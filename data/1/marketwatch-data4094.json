Microsoft said earlier this week that it aimed to conclude the discussions by Sept. 15. - Shares of Tencent 700, +0.84% \u00c2 fell 5% on the Hong Kong stock exchange, amid a general fall of Chinese internet companies. The Trump orders came a few days after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had indicated the U.S. was engaged in a broad campaign against Chinese internet companies. - \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe U.S. is using national security as an excuse and using state power to oppress non-American businesses. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a hegemonic practice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Chinese foreign ministry said on Friday, warning that Washington would \u00e2\u0080\u009cbear the consequences\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the presidential edits. The outlook: Another day, another step in the escalation of tensions between Washington and Beijing, with Trump unlikely to climb down in the final stretch of the U.S. presidential campaign. The two executive orders won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the same impact in China: The Chinese government seems to care little about the fate of TikTok, which boasts of 100 million U.S. users every month. But WeChat, while having a much smaller footprint in the U.S. with about one million users, has a massive presence in China and is the app of choice of the Chinese diaspora."}]}
