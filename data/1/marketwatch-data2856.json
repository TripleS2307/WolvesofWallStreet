The bloc\u2019s 27 leaders had been locked in discussions for four days over the spending package aimed to aid the economic recovery \u2014 twice the scheduled time \u2014 making investors nervous at the beginning of the week. But news of the deal boosted European equities, sending the German DAX DAX, +0.06% into positive territory for the year. The German benchmark index lost some of those gains in the afternoon, slipping back into the red for 2020, trading 1% up for the day in late afternoon trading. The pan-European Stoxx 600 SXXP, +0.55% index provisionally closed 0.3% up, having made 1.2% gains earlier in the day, while the French CAC PX1, +0.71% rose 0.2% and the U.K.\u2019s FTSE 100 UKX, +0.64% nudged 0.1% higher. The euro EURUSD, +0.60%, which had climbed to four-month highs earlier in the week on hopes of a deal, climbed 0.5% after an initial fall. The negotiations had reportedly stalled due to a split between the so-called frugal EU countries \u2014 Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands and Austria \u2014 and those worst affected by the pandemic, such as Italy and Spain. The agreed deal will see \u20ac390 billion offered in grants to individual countries, with the rest coming in the form of loans, lower than the proposed \u20ac500 billion in grants. The leaders also agreed on a multiyear budget of around \u20ac1.1 trillion from 2021-2027. Sam Cooper, vice president of market risk solutions at Silicon Valley Bank, said the conclusion of the marathon summit would be a relief to many and an opportunity when it comes to the euro. \u201cAlthough the euro initially sold off in what appears to be a classic case of buy the rumor, sell the fact, many will welcome the developments and view the intraday weakness as an opportunity to buy a ticket for the long-term euro rally,\u201d he said. GVC Holdings GVC, +3.85% fell 11.7% after the FTSE 100 betting and gambling group said it was being investigated by the U.K. tax authority over \u201cpotential corporate offending\u201d in relation to its former Turkish-facing online gambling business. Norway\u2019s Adevinta ADE, +1.25% surged 26% after the online marketplace said it had agreed to buy eBay\u2019s EBAY, +6.47% classified ads business for $9.2 billion."}]}
