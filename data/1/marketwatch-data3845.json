That is something bond investors want policy makers in Washington to keep in mind as they haggle over another coronavirus aid package, and get down to the wire on the fate of the extra $600 a week CARES Act unemployment benefit that expires Friday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCOVID 19 isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t anybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fault,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Michelle Russell-Dowe, head of securitized credit at global asset manager Schroders, in an interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s created a lot of potholes that need to be filled in by monetary and fiscal stimulus.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Russell-Dowe also said its \u00e2\u0080\u009cpretty critical\u00e2\u0080\u009d for the economy, which shrank a record 32.9% in the second quarter, that \u00e2\u0080\u009cCongress gets something together for consumers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cOtherwise, what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been fending off is having good borrowers, or even good companies, go bad as collateral damage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In June, data on car loans, credit cards and other forms of U.S. consumer debt packaged into bond deals in the $1.5 trillion asset-backed bond market showed 30-day plus delinquencies decline from a year prior, according to Goldman Sachs analysts. Stimulus in action Goldman Sachs Goldman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team points out the declines can be attributed to \u00e2\u0080\u009cstrong fiscal support\u00e2\u0080\u009d from the CARES Act and the willingness of lenders to modify loans to keep borrowers current. But longer loan terms have been a harbinger of higher defaults, and focusing on the recent dip doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show how borrowers with weak finances have struggled to stay current even before the pandemic. \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour most levered borrower has had to borrow to stay afloat, and already has been victimized by income inequality.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Dave Goodson, head of securitized credit at Voya Take subprime auto loan delinquencies, an area flagged as a potential concern even while the economy was roaring. Goldman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team pegged miss payments of at least 30 days at 8.85% in June from 10.86% a year prior. But \u00e2\u0080\u009cpre-pandemic\u00e2\u0080\u009d delinquencies also rivaled those during the aftermath of the 2007-08 global financial crisis, according to BofA data. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn our view, if further support is not provided, credit performance will deteriorate more markedly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d wrote BofA Global\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team of analysts led by Chris Flanagan, in their second half outlook. Ralph Saturne, senior research analyst at Income Research + Management, said he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already seeing a roughly doubling of loan extensions and 60-plus day delinquencies in July, across the major consumer bond issuers he tracks, when comparing the year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first half with the same period of 2019. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitely a concern,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell struck a similar tone Wednesday, when he warned that the economic recovery is showing signs of fading as U.S. Covid-19 infections accelerated since late June. He again vowed to use the Fed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cfull range of tools\u00e2\u0080\u009d until the economy has weathered the storm of the pandemic and urged more spending by Congress. Powell also cautioned against pulling the rug out from under lower-income borrowers who have been the hardest-hit by the pandemic, which this Urban Institute report shows has been impacting Black and Hispanic, or Latino, households the most. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn an environment like this, and even before the economic slowdown, your most levered borrower has had to borrow to stay afloat, and already has been victimized by income inequality,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dave Goodson, head of securitized credit at Voya. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe CARES Act was a godsend for those borrowers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told MarketWatch, adding that it not only propped up struggling households, but also contributed to an eye popping rate of personal savings since February. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we get caught up in a world of uncertainty, because both sides of the political aisle negotiate this aid package into oblivion, how are borrowers supposed to plan what to do next?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat could be a real recipe for disaster.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2 U.S. stocks came under pressure Thursday, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% \u00c2 off 0.9%, but still only about 7.8% away from erasing its losses for the year, while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.39% \u00c2 was 0.4% higher, following the release of data showing the U.S. gross domestic product plunged in the second quarter to a historic low.
