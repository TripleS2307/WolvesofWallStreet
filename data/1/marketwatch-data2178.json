One gauge of the buck, the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, -0.58%, was down 0.6% at 92.30, hanging around the lowest level for the gauge against a half-dozen currencies since around 2018, according to FactSet data. Market Extra:Why the dollar\u2019s fall could turn into a rout if \u2018political disarray\u2019 continues A weaker dollar can boost the appeal of gold because it is priced in the currency while receding yields can lower the opportunity cost of favoring bullion, which doesn\u2019t offer a yield, over Treasurys. \u201cA spike in global bond yields tormented the yen and gold last week but all that is turning around, as yields are back on the decline,\u201d wrote investment analyst Marios Hadjikyriacos at brokerage XM, in a note. The 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.777% was around 0.66%, off 1.5 basis points from its level on Monday. The benchmark bond yield is hanging around its lowest yield since Aug. 11, Dow Jones Market Data said. \u201cDespite last week\u2019s correction, the factors that brought bullion to the dance are still present. Central banks and deficits remain in play, there\u2019s a U.S. election coming up, and tensions with China are getting worse if anything,\u201d Hadjikyriacos wrote. Moves in bullion come as the global death toll for the coronavirus pandemic approached 775,000, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. And signs of Sino-American tensions were evident as the U.S. Commerce Department issued new rules curbing Huawei Technologies\u2019s access to foreign-made chips Monday.
