But New York isn\u2019t New Orleans, and the go-cup is gone. The drinkers up here just couldn\u2019t handle it, turning city sidewalks into raucous block parties, forgetting their masks, forgetting their manners, forgetting the six-feet rule, and most of all, forgetting how hard everyone has worked for the past four months to tame the deadly pandemic and turn this former hot spot into a cool zone. What, and have a bunch of sloppy drunks make the virus explode again? Not as long as Andrew Cuomo is still in the governor\u2019s office. Nobody wants a second wave of COVID-19, least of all the man who navigated the state out of the first one, however imperfectly. \u201cWe are having issues of compliance, especially in New York City, especially around bars and restaurants,\u201d Cuomo said from Albany late Thursday, as he weighed whether to proceed with the Phase 4 reopening currently set for Monday. \u201cI am going to limit it if we do it,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly outdoor activities, which means malls don\u2019t open and cultural institutions can open but only outdoors. No indoor activities.\u201d And then there are the bars and restaurants, fighting desperately to stay alive without infecting the people who patronize them. \u201cWhat you see in New York City is these outdoor block parties selling alcohol. And you have large congregations. That is not what we anticipated. We have to be careful about that. We are going to add additional regulations.\u201d The upshot: No more walk-up beer, wine or cocktails. No booze without food. From now on, if you want to get sloshed in New York City, then plop into a chair at a sidewalk table and order something to eat. And for establishments that flagrantly violate the new regs\u2014oh, the State Liquor Authority has a special deal for you. It goes by the name Three Strikes and You\u2019re Closed. Such are the New York culture wars of today. Also read: You can sip a canned cocktail and save the bees at the same time High, low and in between, almost all the things that make New York exciting are closed, canceled, suspended or being live-streamed from empty venues. The comedy clubs are dark. The live-music joints are quiet. The nightclubs are ancient memories. Thankfully, the entertainment news isn\u2019t entirely bleak. Opening day for the Yankees and Mets is set for next week. Playing in April\u2019s usual position is July. The Brooklyn Nets are sealed in a bubble at Disney World DIS, +1.53% , practicing for nobody-quite-knows-what. That still puts them ahead of their crosstown cousins, the Knicks, who are in the NBA equivalent of the witness protection program. But don\u2019t hold your breath on Broadway. It\u2019s done for the year.

The lights will brighten again, she promised, \u201cas soon as it\u2019s safe to do so,\u201d but under no circumstances before Jan. 3. The Metropolitan Museum of Art announced this week that the doors will reopen to visitors Thursdays through Mondays starting on Aug. 29. \u201cThe safety of our staff and visitors remains our greatest concern,\u201d said Daniel Weiss, the Met\u2019s president and CEO, issuing the caveat that now precedes every such announcement. Then, with appropriate passion, Weiss made the case for why the Met\u2019s reopening is so vital to New York. \u201cThe museum can serve as a reminder of the power of the human spirit and the capacity of art to bring comfort, inspire resilience, and help us better understand each other and the world around us.\u201d Who says we can\u2019t use all of that just about now? Still, Cuomo did not sound overly impressed when he heard about the museum\u2019s big announcement\u2014and not the least bit bound by it. \u201cWhat\u2019s gonna happen Aug. 29?\u201d he asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Nobody knows. I think they can plan to reopen, and then we\u2019ll see what the facts say.\u201d To be fair, the Met has an easier path than Broadway does \u2014 and not just because some of the ceilings are so high the building might as well be considered outdoors. Read: New York City\u2019s 4,000 nail salons face uphill battle after reopening Social distancing is a whole lot easier in a museum than in a theater, and the Met\u2019s economics are far more forgiving. For one thing, there\u2019s the museum\u2019s $3.6 billion endowment. For another, the paintings and sculptures are on duty 24-7 whether the patrons show up or not. Here\u2019s hoping they can all reopen more quickly than New Yorkers expect them to. Just don\u2019t try prowling the galleries with an open container in hand.
