How did equity benchmarks perform? The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% closed 130.40 points, or 0.4%, lower at 27,901.98, after touching a low of 27,647.93.

The Fed\u2019s warning Wednesday about a slow economic recovery that may need additional fiscal help, along with its expectation that near-zero interest rates will remain in force for a minimum of three years, created some uncertainty for investors hoping for further gains. \u201cWe\u2019re at a point where we\u2019re wondering what\u2019s going to drive the next leg up, without an ongoing flow of positive developments,\u201d said Yung-yu Ma, chief investment strategist at BMO Wealth Management, in an interview. A day after the Fed released its most recent policy update, investors said the U.S. central bank Chairman Jerome Powell may have unsettled the stock market by emphasizing the challenges facing the U.S. economy due to the pandemic. The Fed\u2019s \u201cdot plot\u201d showed policymakers expect interest rates to stay near zero until at least 2023, despite the run-up in equity values this year, as the U.S. deals with millions of people who still are unemployed. However, some analysts view the overall tone of the Fed\u2019s Wednesday statement as a positive for the market\u2019s future prospects. \u201cIt is proof the Fed reaction function has changed. And it is bull fuel for the longer run,\u201d wrote Evercore ISI analysts Krishna Guha and Ernie Tedeschi in a note. On U.S. fiscal policy, the prospects for another coronavirus aid package remain confused after news reports said Senate Republicans were unmoved by Trump\u2019s call for more spending. Market participants also watched a reading of the health of the U.S. labor market. Weekly initial jobless benefit claims showed 860,000 Americans filed for unemployment benefits, lower than the estimated 870,000, with continuing claims at 12.63 million, but still reflecting very elevated unemployment levels. Separately, the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index fell to 15 in September from 17.2 in prior month, suggesting a slowing pace of the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. In other U.S. economic reports, U.S. home builders started construction on homes at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.42 million in August, representing a 5% decrease from the previous month, but a 3% uptick from a year ago, the U.S. Census Bureau reported Thursday. There also were conflicting statements on vaccine development from the government. The director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Robert Redfield, said a vaccine would be in \u201cvery limited supply\u201d at the end of the year. President Trump claimed one would be ready for immediate use by the general public soon, potentially causing some downward momentum in equities. Which stocks were in focus?
