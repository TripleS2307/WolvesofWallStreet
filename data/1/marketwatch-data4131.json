The tech duo\u2019s decline accounted for more than half of the Dow\u2019s losses, with investors parsing weak data on employment and growing concerns that another Congressional financial aid package for businesses and pandemic-stricken households may be held up by political wrangling. How did benchmarks perform? The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% closed 353.51 points lower, 1.3%, at 26,652.33, while the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% finished off 40.36 points, or 1.2%, at 3,235.66. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.39% lost 244.71 points, or 2.3%, to reach 10,461.42. The Nasdaq-100 NDX, +1.51%, comprising the largest companies in the Nasdaq, lost 2.7% to reach 10,580.59. The Russell 2000 RUT, +0.55%, which tracks small-cap companies, finished the session virtually unchanged at 1,490.20. What drove the market? Stocks finished sharply lower Thursday, but the overall uptrend in the market appeared to remain intact as investors attempted to shift ownership out of some of the behemoths of tech and e-commerce into areas, thus far, underloved, including small-capitalization stocks. Microsoft wrapped up a record-breaking year Wednesday by announcing record quarterly revenue, but shares fell 4.4% Thursday, while Apple\u2019s stock declined 4.7%. Technology shares represent 27% of the weighting of the broad-market S&P 500, therefore declines in those names can drag the overall market lower. Thursday\u2019s low-key rotation out of popular trades, including Apple, Microsoft, Tesla Inc. TSLA, +1.89%, Amazon.com AMZN, +3.01%, Netflix NFLX, +1.43%, and Google parent Alphabet GOOG, +1.97% GOOGL, +1.82%, came after a weekly report on initial jobless benefits claims showed its first increase in weeks. The Labor Department data showed 1.42 million Americans filed for first-time benefits, a rise of 109,000 and the first rise of those seeking benefits since late March. The weekly employment report has become one of the key measures of the state of the COVID-19 pandemic that has been resurgent in many U.S. states recently, forcing the reimposition of restrictions to curtail the spread of the deadly illness. Investors have been closely following negotiations by lawmakers over further fiscal stimulus. Senate Republicans and the White House struck an agreement on a $1 trillion coronavirus relief package, as a $600 weekly supplement to unemployment benefits is set to expire at the end of this month. The proposal sets the stage for further talks between Senate Republicans and Democrats, who have coalesced around a $3.5 trillion bill that was passed in the House in May, but analysts think negotiations will remain tense. Market participants also parsed a barrage of earnings, including a trio of components of the Dow: Travelers Cos. TRV, +0.18% and Dow Inc. DOW, -0.04%. A report from Intel INTC, -1.03% was expected after Thursday\u2019s close of regular trade. Those quarterly updates come after electric-vehicle maker Tesla produced upbeat results, which featured its fourth consecutive profit thanks to more than $400 million in electric-vehicle tax credits, paving the way for the popular company to join the S&P 500. Meanwhile, investors have been gauging developments between the U.S. and China, with Beijing vowing to close the U.S. consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu, according to the South China Morning Post. The move comes after the U.S. ordered the closure of a Chinese consulate in Houston, citing fraud and espionage, highlighting rising tensions between the global superpowers. In coronavirus news, the U.S. now has 3.9 million cases and 143,000 deaths, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. A \u201ctrifecta\u201d of factors \u2014 fiscal stimulus, encouraging news on the prospect of a vaccine against COVID-19, and better-than-expected economic news \u2014 helped lubricate the markets earlier in the pandemic period, said Michael Stritch, chief investment officer at BMO Wealth Management. But more recently, Stritch said in an interview, \u201cthe virus has reasserted itself. Our view had always been that we\u2019d have a wavy kind of recovery. And yes, we do need more on the fiscal side now. From the market's perspective, it\u2019s a push and pull where bad economic data may light a bit of a fire under Congress to act more quickly.\u201d Like many other observers, Stritch sees markets likely to remain \u201caggressively flat\u201d for the foreseeable future, until there\u2019s more clarity on a treatment. A report on leading U.S. economic indicators rose in June but signalled the economy was likely to remain in recession territory.
