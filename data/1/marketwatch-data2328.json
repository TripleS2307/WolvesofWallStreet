A sharp surge in retail sales helped to underscore the rapid progress made by efforts to reopen the U.S. economy, showing signs that consumers were willing to spend despite a surge in unemployment. Sales at U.S. retailers rose 17.7% in May, compared with a forecast 8.5% increase and a revised 14.7% fall in April. Yet even after the rebound in May, sales were still 6% lower compared to the same month in 2019. In other U.S. data, industrial production rose by a slight 1.4% last month, after slumping 12.5% in April. The NAHB Homebuilders\u2019 index rose 21 points to a reading of 58 in June.

But Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank was switching away from purchases of exchange-traded funds, and this would not necessarily lead to a change in the pace of corporate-bond purchases unless market conditions shifted. This appeared to dampen hopes that the Fed was using Monday\u2019s announcement to allow the central bank to hoover up more corporate debt.

It really shows that the reopening of the U.S. economy is happening, and the numbers support it,\u201d said Kevin Giddis, chief fixed-income strategist at Raymond James, referring to May\u2019s retail sales release."}]}
