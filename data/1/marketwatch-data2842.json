He said that firms were taking on debt to make sure they can \u00e2\u0080\u009csurvive and thrive\u00e2\u0080\u009d in a time of low revenue. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo far so good, but we will certainly watch this closely,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Bullard said the Fed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bond-buying wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t undermining capitalism by protecting zombie firms. Firms that were viable before the coronavirus are figuring out how to run their businesses in ways to keep everyone healthy, he said. The pandemic was throwing a curve ball to a few businesses, but \u00e2\u0080\u009cmost\u00e2\u0080\u009d firms will be up and running after July, he said. There is constant market chatter about bubbles forming as the Fed has cut its benchmark interst rate to near zero and purchased more than $2 trillion in U.S. Treasury debt and agency mortgage backed securities to repair damaged financial markets.

One of the main concerns is that yield curve control \u00e2\u0080\u009cended in tears\u00e2\u0080\u009d after it was used in World War II, he noted. Fed officials wanted to end the controls after the war but the Truman administration, fearing inflation, resisted until 1951. Bullard suggested yield curve control is not a front-burner issue as the market and Fed are on the same page about the outlook for low interest rates. The Fed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dot-plot of projected interest rates released earlier this month showed officials expect rates to stay near zero until 2023. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really think this is a pending thing for the committee,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bullard said. The Fed has credibility because it kept interest rates close to zero from the end of 2008 until 2015. The Fed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2% inflation target is also credible to the markets , Bullard said, and this will keep inflation relatively close to the target in this recession.
