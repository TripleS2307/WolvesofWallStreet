Just eight years later, Biden has vowed to make public college free for some and cancel a portion of borrowers\u2019 student debt if he\u2019s elected \u2014 proposals that are less sweeping than some offered during the Democratic primary campaign that Biden ultimately won. Since 2012, student debt has grown from $970 billion to nearly $1.6 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The Great Recession and its slow recovery pushed more students to school to retrain; squeezed families, hampering their ability to pay for college; pressured state budgets, limiting the amount they sent to public colleges, pushing prices up; and sent graduates into a labor market where wages hadn\u2019t grown much historically, making their higher-than-historical student loan balances difficult to repay. But it\u2019s not just the experience of student debt that\u2019s broadened over the past several years, the rhetoric around it has changed too. Expansive proposals for cancelling student debt have gained traction and prominent battles over the debt held by students who were defrauded by their colleges have shown voters that there are ways to legally discharge borrowers\u2019 federal student loans. In addition, research from a variety of scholars has highlighted the disproportionate impact that America\u2019s debt-financed higher education system has on Black students and families, creating more urgency around changing it. And in the past few months, the coronavirus pandemic has exposed the financial precariousness of so many families and the role that student loans play in the challenges they face keeping up with bills. Now student debt is \u201csquarely on the ballot,\u201d in a way it hasn\u2019t been before, said Natalia Abrams, the executive director of Student Debt Crisis, a borrower advocacy group. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t let that go without being recognized,\u201d Abrams said. Her organization decided to endorse Biden, who has vowed to cancel some student debt if elected. The decision to back a candidate marks the first time Student Debt Crisis has endorsed a presidential candidate. Student Debt Crisis joined with Rise, a nonprofit organizing students around eliminating tuition and fees, ending student hunger and homelessness and other issues, to make the endorsement. \u201cWith the right person in the White House student borrowers have a chance,\u201d Abrams said. The last time Biden\u2019s opponent, President Donald Trump, was on the ticket, he made brief mention of streamlining the student loan repayment system. This summer, Trump extended a pandemic-related pause on federal student loan payments and collections that was set to expire a month before the election. Here\u2019s what each candidate\u2019s election might mean for the future of the higher education and student loan systems: Joe BidenCollege affordability Biden is proposing to make public college tuition-free for families earning $125,000 or less. Momentum for some kind of free college plan was already building in the lead up to the 2016 election, with the Obama administration proposing to make community college free in 2015 and some states and communities already offering free college programs of their own. Free college became a point of contention in the 2016 Democratic primary, with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton touting an initiative that would allow students to go to college debt-free, and Senator Bernie Sanders, a Vermont Independent, advocating for a plan to make public college tuition free. The debate was about more than semantics: Supporters of a debt-free college program like Clinton\u2019s argued that it would better target resources to families who need the most help. Advocates of tuition-free college have said its simple messaging would push more low-income students to respond to the proposal, instead of assuming they\u2019d have to fill out tedious paperwork to get access to an affordable college education. By making free college available to everyone, regardless of income, a tuition-free college proposal would create political buy-in that\u2019s typically absent from means-tested programs, advocates argued. Clinton, who ultimately won the 2016 nomination, adopted some of the planks of Sanders\u2019 plan as she faced Trump. Biden is continuing in that vein. Though he isn\u2019t proposing to make college free for every American, his campaign estimates that his plan would cover roughly 80% of families. \u201cThe Joe Biden plan is really building off of the compromise that Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton struck in 2016,\u201d said Jenna Sablan, an assistant research professor at Georgetown University Center for Education and the Workforce. \u201cThe Sanders side wanted universal free college and other parts of the Democratic Party felt like that would be too much of a giveaway.\u201d But the challenges and opportunities related to implementing a free college plan look different today than in 2016. If the Great Recession is any indication, state budgets will likely suffer from the pandemic-induced downturn and any national free college program would rely on some kind of federal state funding partnership. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to get a national free college policy without doing something big to restore the money that states are hemorrhaging in their budgets,\u201d said Mark Huelsman, associate director of policy and research at Demos, a progressive think tank. Huelsman said he could see college affordability being a piece of a proposal that would restore state budgets. The Biden campaign didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, but a bill introduced by Sanders in 2017 that is similar to Biden\u2019s proposed federal-state partnership would cost an estimated $600 billion. The federal-state partnership is part of what makes Jason Delisle, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, skeptical of Biden\u2019s proposal. The idea that states would have to opt-in, makes it difficult for it to be the foundation of a national free college plan, he said. But perhaps more broadly, Delisle worries that a partnership like this could become the basis for the federal government to exert influence on states\u2019 higher education policies, which Delisle says differ for good reason. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge proposal and an absolute paradigm shift in the way the federal government would help people pay for college,\u201d Delisle said. He prefers an approach to college affordability Biden advocated as vice president: A $4,000 tax credit \u2014 a smaller version of which ultimately became law \u2014 to families and students paying for college as a way to defray the cost. \u201cBiden\u2019s support for free college is a completely different approach than the tax credit, the tax credit is essentially a voucher to families and it\u2019s hands off,\u201d Delisle said. With free college, on the other hand, students have to go to public school to take advantage and some states may place requirements on what types of students can attend, Delisle said. In some states that have already created their own free college programs participants must be attending full-time, for example. Student-loan debt cancellation The 2020 Democratic primary was the first major election contest to feature broad initiatives to cancel student debt. Sanders proposed wiping away all outstanding student loans and Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, touted a plan that would have discharged up to $50,000 in student debt for borrowers earning less than $250,000. Biden has proposed cancelling $10,000 in student debt, an initiative that\u2019s gained traction during the pandemic. The Democratic-led house proposed cancelling that level of student debt for economically distressed borrowers as part of the HEROES Act, their May coronavirus relief proposal. Cancelling $10,000 in student debt would completely wipe away the loan balances of 30% of borrowers, according to a Brookings Institution analysis. Warren and Senator Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, introduced a resolution earlier this month urging the cancellation of up to $50,000 in federal student loans per borrower. The Biden campaign didn\u2019t immediately respond to their proposal, but during a conference call with reporters, Schumer said the former vice president is \u201cvery seriously entertaining\u201d it. What Biden has officially proposed thus far is to cancel federal undergraduate student debt for borrowers earning up to $125,000 as long as it was related to their education at a public college, a Historically Black College or university or Minority Serving Institution. Proposals for broad-based student debt cancellation have been criticized for providing a boon to highly-educated and in some cases, wealthy borrowers. Borrowers who attended graduate school typically have the highest student loan balances and so would receive the largest benefit, at least in dollars, from this type of proposal. It appears that Biden\u2019s proposal is structured in part to address those concerns. But delineating between borrowers could wind up excluding groups that in many ways have been victims of our college finance system, borrower advocates say. For example, the gap in student debt between Black and white borrowers tends to grow after graduation in part because Black borrowers are more likely to attend graduate school at a for-profit college \u2014 schools that have been criticized for saddling borrowers with large debts for poor outcomes. \u201cWhat happens is when you start picking and choosing you start leaving people out,\u201d said Persis Yu, the executive director of the Student Loan Borrower Assistance Project at the National Consumer Law Center. Delisle, of the right-leaning AEI, and critics of Biden\u2019s debt cancellation proposal on the left, have called it \u201carbitrary.\u201d \u201cThe current Biden plan reads like the terms and conditions of a Comcast agreement,\u201d said Astra Taylor, a co-founder of the Debt Collective, a debtor advocacy group. \u201cThey are so determined to distinguish worthy from unworthy debtors that they end up drawing these incredibly arbitrary lines.\u201d In a statement following Schumer and Warren\u2019s announcement, the Debt Collective members said they \u201ccelebrate the momentous nature,\u201d of Senators\u2019 plan. Still, they wrote, \u201cwe do not agree with\u201d the $50,000 limit, they wrote, adding that \u201cit is certainly better than,\u201d Biden\u2019s $10,000 cancellation proposal, \u201cand far beyond any Republican plan. But we want to be clear: we need to cancel ALL student debt.\u201d A broad-based student debt cancellation program makes both electoral sense \u2014 \u201cstudent debt cancellation has the potential to bring in voters who might be on the sidelines\u201d \u2014 and economic sense, Taylor said. Research has indicated that cancelling student debt would boost the economy. Biden is also proposing tweaks to the student loan system that could expand other pathways for debt discharge. Though he was part of a group of lawmakers who backed a 2005 bankruptcy reform law, which makes it very difficult for borrowers with private student loans to discharge them in bankruptcy, Biden has said that as president, he would urge Congress to reverse that law. In addition, Biden has vowed to streamline a troubled existing loan forgiveness program for public servants and provide up to $10,000 of undergraduate student loan relief (up to five years) for every borrower working in public service. Donald Trump The Trump campaign hasn\u2019t said much about the President\u2019s plans for student debt and college affordability, but voters can get a sense of what might be in store based on what he\u2019s already done as president. One thing that is clear: If reelected, the president likely won\u2019t pursue a free college program. \u201cThe reality of Biden\u2019s \u2018free college\u2019 plan is that it\u2019s anything but free, and he and his campaign should explain to the American people what the total cost of their socialist plan is and how they expect to pay for it,\u201d Courtney Parella, deputy national press secretary for the Trump campaign, wrote in an emailed statement. Trump\u2019s Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, has rolled back an Obama-era provision that required for-profit colleges to prove they were preparing students for gainful employment. In May, Trump vetoed a bipartisan bill passed by Congress that would have required the Education Department to implement an Obama-era version of the \u201cborrower defense rule,\u201d a legal process borrowers can use to have their student loans cancelled if they believe they\u2019ve been defrauded by their colleges. The Trump administration has described the 2016 version of the borrower defense rule as an \u201coverreach,\u201d arguing that its version of the rule would save taxpayers $11 billion over the next 10 years. Borrower advocates have said that the DeVos-era Department of Education\u2019s approach to the borrower defense process would make it difficult for borrowers who have been scammed by for-profit colleges to obtain relief. They\u2019ve also sued DeVos and the Department multiple times over their implementation of the rule. Biden has vowed a return to the for-profit college rules honed during the Obama administration, but Taylor of the Debt Collective \u2014 which through its organization of for-profit college borrowers, helped push the Obama administration to streamline the process for discharging debt held by scammed borrowers \u2014 said it\u2019s not enough. The Debt Collective has argued for years that the Obama administration didn\u2019t work fast enough when it was clear that major corporations that would ultimately collapse were defrauding students. \u201cThe for-profit education sector needs to be eliminated,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThere\u2019s so much data, there\u2019s so much research that shows that they are predatory actors that prey on vulnerable communities.\u201d In 2019, Trump signed a memo that would discharge the student debt of permanently disabled veterans. Prominent Democratic lawmakers have said the memo doesn\u2019t go far enough, arguing that the administration should grant an automatic discharge to all permanently and totally disabled borrowers. These borrowers have a legal right to have their debts wiped away, but they have to face an often challenging bureaucratic process to do so. This summer the Trump administration extended the pause on student loan payments and collections that Congress implemented through the CARES Act, the coronavirus stimulus bill, through Dec. 31. The pause was originally set to expire on Sept. 30. \u201cThere was a recognition during this recession that student borrowers were going to have the bottom fall out from under them,\u201d Huelsman said. But it\u2019s unclear what, if any, relief borrowers might receive after the payment pause expires, he said. \u201cFor all intents and purposes, the economy is probably not going to be in much better shape than it is now,\u201d at the start of the new year, he said."}]}
