The SPDR Gold Trust GLD, +1.81% was up 1.4% in the early afternoon and the iShares Gold Trust IAU, +1.82% rose 1.3%. Both funds looked set for their strongest weekly performance since the market gyrations of the last week of March sent investors into safe havens. A smaller spin-off of the SPDR fund, which was the first and largest ETF to track gold, SPDR Minishares Trust GLDM, +1.80%, rose 1.3% Thursday but was up a few basis points more than the other two for the week. After roaring higher over the past few weeks, silver ETFs took a breather: the iShares Silver Trust was down 1% Thursday, but up nearly 27% over the past month."}]}
