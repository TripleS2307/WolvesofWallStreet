And that \u00e2\u0080\u009cbifurcation\u00e2\u0080\u009d raises a very important question for investors, argued Dan Suzuki, deputy chief investment officer at Richard Bernstein Advisors, in a Thursday note. He observed that since the market\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pre-pandemic peak in February, the price-to-earnings multiples of what he dubbed the \u00e2\u0080\u009cFANMAG\u00e2\u0080\u009d stocks \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Facebook Inc. FB, +0.26%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +3.01%, Netflix Inc. NFLX, +1.43%, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +2.48%, Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.74% and Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOG, +1.97% GOOGL, +1.82% have expanded by roughly 20%. Over the same period, the valuations of the rest of the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% have expanded by a still respectable 15%-plus. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut these two groups of stocks have gotten more expensive for completely different reasons,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he noted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFANMAG\u00e2\u0080\u0099s P/E has risen because their \u00e2\u0080\u0098P\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (prices) has gone up faster than their \u00e2\u0080\u0098E\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (earnings), while the P/E for the rest of the S&P 500 has expanded because \u00e2\u0080\u0098E\u00e2\u0080\u0099 has gone down much more than \u00e2\u0080\u0098P.'\u00e2\u0080\u009d (see table below). Suzuki emphasized that valuation metrics are terrible market-timing indicators, but noted that client questions have been on the rise as some valuation measures approach double their historic average. Suzuki said there was \u00e2\u0080\u009cno doubt\u00e2\u0080\u009d that high-growth tech stocks had justified their outperformance over the past decade and this year based on their superior profit growth. But investors should now be asking themselves one important question, he said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre the earnings of FANMAG so much more likely to beat the raised expectations (up 10% since February) than the slashed earnings expectations of the rest of the index (down 16%), such that their 100% valuation premium is warranted?\u00e2\u0080\u009d If the recovery is sustainable, that would require FANMAG\u00e2\u0080\u0099s improving secular growth to outweigh the rest of the market\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operating leverage, he said, which \u00e2\u0080\u009cseems like a very pessimistic bet against the recovery. \u00e2\u0080\u009d Meanwhile, those highflying shares were giving back a chunk of their recent gains in a sharp selloff on Thursday, a day after the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39% and the S&P 500 logged another round of record finishes. The Nasdaq was down over 500 points, or 4%, while the S&P 500 dropped nearly 3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% was also dragged down, off around 640 points, or 2.2%."}]}
