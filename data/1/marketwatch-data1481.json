From Monday, the public will face arrest if they gather outside or inside in groups of more than six, Johnson said in his first public coronavirus briefing in six weeks. Rules were relaxed in July to allow friends and family to congregate in groups of up to 30. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will boost the enforcement capacity of local authorities by introducing COVID-secure marshals to help ensure social distancing in town and city centers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Johnson said making it law that bars and restaurants record the contact details of customers. \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098Premises where people meet socially will be legally required to request the contact details of a member of every party, and record and retain these details for 21 days.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Boris Johnson \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn future, premises where people meet socially will be legally required to request the contact details of a member of every party, and record and retain these details for 21 days.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Read: AstraZeneca vaccine \u00e2\u0080\u0098most likely\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to roll out in the U.K. early next year The government has been forced to act because of a sudden increase in new coronavirus cases in recent days. In April 6,000 new cases were recorded a day, but this dropped to well below 1,000 in June. Newly diagnosed cases have risen beyond 2,000 for the past three days, according to data from the Department of Health and Social Care. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe reason that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing\u00c2 this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the prime minister said, speaking of the new measures, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis to\u00c2 prevent another wholesale national lockdown of the kind\u00c2 that\u00c2 we had in March.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Spain, France and Germany have been battling to avoid a second wave, and the U.K. is hoping these swift and strict new rules will stop the spread of the virus. Experts in the U.S. have been following developments in Europe closely.

Johnson now wants to make it easier and faster for people to get a test, and focus on identifying those without the virus to allow as many people \u00e2\u0080\u009cto lead more normal lives\u00e2\u0080\u009d as possible.\u00c2 Testing will expand to include those who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have symptoms, \u00e2\u0080\u009cso we can allow them to behave in a more normal way in the knowledge that they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t infect anyone else with the virus,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Johnson said. This is a departure from the current testing regime, which is limited to identifying those with the virus.

Johnson said the plan \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill require a giant collaborative effort from the government, from\u00c2 business, from public health professionals, scientists, logistics experts, and many, many more.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A pilot project will be rolled out in Salford, near Manchester in northern England, next month to explore the practicality of testing people before attending venues for mass events, like theaters and sports grounds, at indoor and outdoor venues. Drastically ramping up testing capacity and allowing people without symptoms to get a test will also bring implications for those traveling to the U.K. from abroad. Currently, travelers from much of the world are required to self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival to England. If travelers from abroad test negative, they could be released from quarantine. The prime minister outlined plans for a \"moonshot\" new testing regime, including ambitions to return test results in 20 to 90 minutes.

The science adviser reiterated the sentiment from major drug manufacturers this week that trials should proceed with caution and that pauses like the one seen in the AstraZeneca trial are an integral part of the approval process. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrong to just jump over those stages and approve a vaccine on hope.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Prime Minister Boris Johnson is flanked by Chief Medical Officer for England Chris Whitty, left, and Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance at the press conference, convened virtually from Downing Street.
