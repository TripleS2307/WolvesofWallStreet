Investors continued to keep an eye on the moves in the dollar, as well as prospects for additional stimulus from Washington. \u201cGold price consolidation continues,\u201d said Will Cai, partner at Wilshire Phoenix. Prices have been \u201cresilient with fundamental supporting factors still in place,\u201d he said in emailed commentary. \u201cSome of the underlying drivers are themselves in retracement/consolidation after overextension,\u201d including real interest rates\u2013thus affecting gold price. \u201cGeneral bullish macro conditions\u201d are still in play for gold in medium to long term, such as economic uncertainty and inflation expectations, he said. Gold for December delivery GCZ20, +2.17% fell $11.30, or 0.6%, to settle at $1,908.80 an ounce on Comex. Prices had tacked on 0.7% Monday to settle at $1,920.10\u2013the highest for a most-active contract since Sept. 18, according to FactSet data. December silver fell 64 cents, or 2.6%, to $23.921 an ounce, giving up more than the 2.2% climb from a day earlier. The dollar, as measured by the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, -0.58%, fell Monday and was little changed in Tuesday dealings. A weaker dollar is seen as a positive for gold and other commodities priced in dollars, making them less expensive to users of other currencies. A rise in Treasury yields though on Tuesday was seen as a negative for gold. Falling yields have contributed to the metal\u2019s gains this year, reducing the opportunity cost of holding nonyielding assets like commodities. It would likely take a big rebound for the dollar and a slide in government bond prices, or a sustained rise in yields, to spark a sharp gold selloff, said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at ThinkMarkets, in a note \u2014 a scenario he sees as unlikely. \u201cWell, for yields to rise sharply, the Fed and other major central banks will have to drop their dovish views and start tightening their belts. So, it all boils down to the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut right now, or in the foreseeable future, the global economy is not in a state that requires tighter monetary \u2013 and indeed fiscal \u2013 conditions.\u201d On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated his belief that the U.S. economy needs more fiscal support, even as the recovery from pandemic has been strong thus far. \u201cThe recovery will be stronger and move faster if monetary policy and fiscal policy continue to work side by side to provide support to the economy until it is clearly out of the woods,\u201d he said in a speech to the National Association for Business Economics. In other Comex metals trading, December copper HGZ20, +1.38% barely budged, up 0.02% to $2.9635 a pound. January platinum PLF21, +3.84% shed 3.8% to $870.30 an ounce, but December palladium PAZ20, +2.31% settled at $2,391.20 an ounce, up 0.5%."}]}
