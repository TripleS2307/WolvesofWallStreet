We all want to get on with our lives. But the hard reality is that this is not even close to being over.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u201d That was the grim message from Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organization, on Monday during a briefing about the state of the coronavirus pandemic. Tuesday marks the six-month anniversary of the outbreak\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first reported cases in China. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlthough many countries have made some progress globally, the pandemic is actually speeding up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tedros said at the briefing in Geneva, Switzerland. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe worst is yet to come. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry to say that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d His remarks came a day after COVID-19 reached two dire milestones: 10 million confirmed infections worldwide, and 500,000 deaths.

At the briefing, Tedros reiterated that people, even those not feeling symptoms, need to continue to physically distance, wash their hands and wear masks when appropriate. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou may be in a low-risk category, but the choices you make could be the difference between life and death for someone else,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.

If any country is saying contact tracing is difficult, it is a lame excuse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Contact tracing has been notably poor in the U.S., with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top infectious disease expert, saying Friday that the process of tracking down people who may have been exposed to those infected was \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot going well.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}]}
