'The worst is yet to come'", "body": "\u201c \"We all want this to be over. We all want to get on with our lives. But the hard reality is that this is not even close to being over.\" \u201d That was the grim message from Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organization, on Monday during a briefing about the state of the coronavirus pandemic. Tuesday marks the six-month anniversary of the outbreak's first reported cases in China. \"Although many countries have made some progress globally, the pandemic is actually speeding up,\" Tedros said at the briefing in Geneva, Switzerland. \"The worst is yet to come. I'm sorry to say that.\" His remarks came a day after COVID-19 reached two dire milestones: 10 million confirmed infections worldwide, and 500,000 deaths.

At the briefing, Tedros reiterated that people, even those not feeling symptoms, need to continue to physically distance, wash their hands and wear masks when appropriate. \"You may be in a low-risk category, but the choices you make could be the difference between life and death for someone else,\" he said.

If any country is saying contact tracing is difficult, it is a lame excuse,\" he said. Contact tracing has been notably poor in the U.S., with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, saying Friday that the process of tracking down people who may have been exposed to those infected was \"not going well.\""}]}
