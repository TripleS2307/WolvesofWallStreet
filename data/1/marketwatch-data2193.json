(AP) \u2014 Protesters who have clashed with authorities in the Pacific Northwest are not just confronting local police. Some are also facing off against federal officers whose presence reflects President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to make cracking down on \u201cviolent mayhem\u201d a federal priority. The Department of Homeland Security has deployed officers in tactical gear from around the country, and from more than a half-dozen federal law-enforcement agencies and departments, to Portland, Ore., as part of a surge aimed at what a senior official said were people taking advantage of demonstrations over the police killing of George Floyd to engage in violence and vandalism. \u201cOnce we surged federal law-enforcement officers to Portland, the agitators quickly got the message,\u201d said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing operation. The deployment represents somewhat of a departure for DHS, which was created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and is primarily focused on threats from abroad and border security. During the Trump presidency, its focus has been largely on carrying out the president\u2019s tough immigration agenda. Now it is in the role of supporting Trump\u2019s law-and-order campaign, raising questions about whether it is overstepping the duties of local law enforcement. Portland Deputy Police Chief Chris Davis said his department did not request the assistance and did not coordinate efforts with the federal government during often clashes that have ranged across several downtown blocks after midnight for weeks. \u201cI don\u2019t have authority to order federal officers to do things,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIt does complicate things for us.\u201d The DHS officers\u2019 presence comes at a tense moment for Portland. After Floyd\u2019s death, the city for days saw marches and rallies that attracted more than 10,000 generally peaceful Black Lives Matter protesters to the downtown area. The police took a \u201cmostly hands-off approach\u201d to those events because they were orderly, Davis said. Agents from different components of the Department of Homeland Security are deployed at a federal courthouse in Portland, Ore., on Sunday as protesters faced off with city police and a contingent of federal agents reflecting a new priority for the Department of Homeland Security: preventing what President Donald Trump has called \"violent mayhem.\" Associated Press Trump, speaking at a military base near Miami on Friday, said Portland officials failed to adequately respond to the protests. \u201cIt was out of control,\u201d he said to acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf. \u201cThe locals couldn\u2019t handle it and you people are handling it very nicely.\u201d Key Words (December 2019):Replacement border wall should be considered new wall, insists Chad Wolf, Trump\u2019s acting secretary of homeland security Civil-liberties advocates and activists have accused federal authorities of overstepping their jurisdiction and excessive use of crowd-control measures, including using tear gas and patrolling beyond the boundaries of federal property. Portland police are prohibited from using tear gas under a recent temporary court order unless they declare a riot. \u201cDHS should go back to investigating the rise of white supremacist activity and actors who are seeking to cause violence against these peaceful protests, that is under the purview of the agency\u2019s mission,\u201d said Andrea Flores, the deputy director of immigration policy at the American Civil Liberties Union, who was a DHS official during the Obama administration. Trump issued an executive order on June 26 to protect monuments after protesters tried to remove or destroy statues of people considered racist, including a failed attempt to pull down one of Andrew Jackson near the White House. The president has denounced the Black Lives Matter movement and protests calling for the removal of statues honoring racist figures, associating peaceful protests with the sporadic outbursts of vandalism and looting at some demonstrations. He referred to \u201cthe violent mayhem we have seen in the streets of cities that are run by liberal Democrats,\u201d as well as the \u201cmerciless campaign to wipe out our history,\u201d in his July 3 Mount Rushmore speech. The Margin:A message hard to ignore: New Yorkers paint \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 in front of Trump Tower Following the executive order, DHS created the Protecting American Communities Task Force and sent officers from Customs and Border Protection and other agencies to Washington, D.C.; Seattle; and Portland. Others were ready to deploy elsewhere if needed. Improving coordination among law enforcement agencies is part of DHS\u2019s mission. It also oversees the Federal Protective Service, which guards federal government buildings around the nation. But the FPS doesn\u2019t have the resources to respond to the sustained attacks that have taken place in Portland and elsewhere on the margins of protests over the May 25 killing of Floyd in Minneapolis. FPS Officer David Underwood was shot and killed outside a federal building in Oakland during a May protest. Authorities charged an Air Force staff sergeant affiliated with the far-right, anti-government \u201cboogaloo\u201d movement with his murder. As local governments in Washington, D.C., and Portland have stepped back to allow space for peaceful demonstrations, the Trump administration has stepped up its effort against what the senior official called \u201copportunistic criminals.\u201d Attorney General William Barr says there have been more than 150 arrests on federal charges, including destruction of property and assault, around the country, with about 500 investigations pending related to recent protests. There were about a dozen in Portland in recent days. Portland police officials say the cycle of nightly attacks, which have shut down much of the downtown, has been unprecedented. Early Thursday, a man in a SUV fired several times into the air as he drove away from protesters who had surrounded his car. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen this intensity of violence and focused criminal activity over this long period of time,\u201d Davis said. Among the federal forces deployed in Portland are members of an elite Border Patrol tactical team, a special operations unit that is based on the U.S.-Mexico border and has been deployed overseas, including to Iraq and Afghanistan. BORTAC members, identifiable by patches on their camouflage sleeves, are mixed in with Federal Protective Service officers outside the courthouse. Others in the unit, which includes snipers, have been stationed in \u201coverlook\u201d positions on the courthouse\u2019s ninth floor, where a protester in a black hoodie shined a green laser into the eyes of one of the officers on Monday, according to court documents. The night before, a BORTAC agent tackled and arrested a demonstrator suspected of pointing a laser at him and others from a park across the street from the courthouse. A former DHS official said BORTAC agents were viewed as \u201chighly trained, valuable, scarce resources\u201d and would typically be used for domestic law enforcement in extraordinary circumstances. \u201cThese units don\u2019t normally sit around idle,\u201d said the official, who spoke on condition anonymity because he no longer works at the agency, after serving under Trump and President Barack Obama, and is not authorized to discuss operations. \u201cWhat did they get pulled off of in order to watch over statues?\u201d"}]}
