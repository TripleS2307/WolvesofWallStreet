Here are some ideas to save money", "body": "I\u2019m always talking about Social Security and how it\u2019s a life vest for tens of millions of Americans. But the average monthly benefit this year is just $1,503. And yet, notes the Washington Post, \u201cforty percent of Americans over age 60 who are no longer working full time rely solely on Social Security for their income.\u201d If you\u2019re that average retiree, I don\u2019t have to tell you how difficult it is to live on $1,503 a month, or $18,036 a year. Every dollar counts. Every single one. Divorce inspired this woman to learn about money and she retired early You\u2019ve probably cut your expenses to the bone. Or have you? I\u2019ve been gathering some ideas, that perhaps you haven\u2019t thought of that could save a few bucks. In this column, I\u2019ll focus on two areas: Your electric bill and your water bill. Slash your electric bill The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) says the average monthly electric bill in the United States in 2018 was $117.65. That\u2019s 8% of the average Social Security benefit! You\u2019ve got all sorts of things plugged in right now. You might think that because the TV or coffee maker are turned off, they\u2019re not using any electricity. Actually they are. These devices are called \u201cenergy vampires\u201d because they drain electricity around the clock, whether they\u2019re being used or not. \u201cThese phantom energy suckers can account for as much as 20% of your monthly electricity bill,\u201d North Carolina-based Duke Energy, says. One-fifth of that average $117.65 electric bill is an extra $23.53 a month. Not huge, but again, if you\u2019re on a fixed income, every dollar counts. What can you do? Some tips: Unplug things. I know you won\u2019t do this for the clock radio you might have on your nightstand, but if you have devices that are used infrequently\u2014maybe a TV in your bedroom that you watch only a little bit at night\u2014yank the cord. Use \u201csmart power\u201d strips. These automatically cut off power when devices aren\u2019t in use. Some devices, like computers, have built-in \u201csleep modes\u201d that save energy when they\u2019re idle. Fluorescent lightbulbs cost more up front, but can save energy and money over the long run.Cut your water bill The average monthly water bill in the U.S. is $70.39 a month, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). It says the typical family uses 300 gallons of water a day. That 70 bucks is nearly 5% of your monthly Social Security check. The Volusia County, Fla., water conservation department offers some money-saving tips: A typical shower uses up to 10 gallons of water a minute. Consider limiting your showers to the time it takes to soap up, wash down and rise off. Your toilet could be wasting thousands of gallons of water a month. Find out by putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank. If, without flushing, the coloring begins to appear in the bowl, you have a leak\u2014and are literally flushing money away (though you\u2019d have to balance fixing this against the cost of a plumber). Don\u2019t run the water while shaving and brushing your teeth. Before brushing, fill a water glass to rinse. Before shaving, fill the sink with an inch or two of warm water in which to rinse your razor. Use your dishwasher and washing machines only when there\u2019s a full load. And setting your washing machine to cold wash and rinse saves energy and gets your clothes just as clean. Plant trees and plants that thrive without water. And surround them with mulch, which slows evaporation. There are many more good ideas here. Exercise But you know the single biggest thing\u2014by far\u2014you can do to save money? Stay healthy. Keeping fit\u2014both mentally and physically\u2014for as long as you can will not only add more enjoyment to your life, but save incalculable amounts of money. Fidelity Investments estimated last year that a couple retiring at age 65 would have to spend\u2014get this\u2014$285,000 on health care over the rest of their lives. A single man can expect to spend $135,000, but a single woman, because of longer life expectancies\u2014could spend $150,000. Fidelity has yet to offer a 2020 estimate, but you can be sure it\u2019ll be higher. Coming back to what I said up top\u2014that the average Social Security recipient currently gets $18,036 a year\u2014it\u2019s easy to see how big of a burden this will be. You don\u2019t me to tell you that exercise is good for you. But I am here to tell you the cost of NOT exercising could be significant. Also: people think that doing the crossword puzzle is the way to keep your brain sharp. It helps, but you know what really helps? Exercise, because it increases the flow of oxygenated blood to your head. As usual, talk to a doctor about what\u2019s best for you given your age and circumstances. I\u2019m obviously just scratching the surface on money-saving ideas. In future columns, I\u2019ll offer more. Meantime, tell me how YOU save money during these tough times; I may share your tips with fellow readers. Please write me at: RetireBetterMarketWatch@gmail.com."}]}
