Spaced-out tables in restaurants. Hand sanitizer everywhere. But as American businesses sketch out a post-COVID future, dozens of other changes are almost certainly on the way. And many of them are being quietly imagined now in New York City. Why wouldn\u2019t they be? New York doesn\u2019t only have America\u2019s largest urban economy. With 209,000 confirmed coronavirus infections and more than 17,100 deaths, no city has a deeper hole to climb out of. Yes, the lingering threat of a deadly pandemic really does change everything, morning, noon and night. When it comes to New York night life, size suddenly matters in ways it never has before. \u201cThe big nightclubs will have the toughest road back,\u201d said David Rabin, the New York night-life pioneer behind such era-defining venues as the Meatpacking District\u2019s Lotus and Double Seven. \u201cThe whole point of a big club is a large number of people packed together. That\u2019s a very hard sell right now.\u201d The post-COVID future belongs to smaller, neighborhood venues, especially restaurants, bars and lounges with a rooftop or an outdoor garden, in locations people can get to without a taxi or subway ride, Rabin said. City Hall is already promising looser permitting for sidewalk cafes. But no one knows yet how the neighbors will respond. See:Yes, America needs to brace itself for a second wave of coronavirus \u201cIn recent years, New Yorkers have gotten used to a much quieter city,\u201d said Rabin, whose current portfolio of Manhattan establishments include the Lambs Club, Cafe Clover, American Bar, The Skylark and Jimmy\u2019s on the roof of SoHo\u2019s James Hotel, all of which are currently closed. \u201cWhat happens when, suddenly, the sidewalks are crowded with outdoor cafes and people are below my window, chatting into the night?\u201d But New York isn\u2019t San Diego. By late October, outdoor dining revenues will fall as sharply as the temperatures. The survive-or-not issue, according to Rabin, is how flexible commercial landlords are prepared to be. \u201cLandlords keep telling bar and restaurant owners, \u2018My mortgage documents say I need to get X-dollars a square foot.\u2019 Some landlords are hiding behind that, but it\u2019s a conversation that has to go all the way up the line. I don\u2019t believe the bank really wants to inherit a portfolio of office buildings with four or five retail spaces empty.\u201d The only workable answer may be setting rents as a percentage of revenues, at least temporarily. Eight percent is a figure being thrown around. \u201cOtherwise,\u201d Rabin said, \u201cthe city stays boarded up the way it\u2019s boarded up now. Nobody wants that.\u201d Check out the Coronavirus Economic Recovery Tracker At the same time the threat of infection is defining New York after dark, the coronavirus has also delivered wrenching new challenges into the realm of family care, as people struggle to look after their elderly, sick and disabled loved ones. \u201cCaregiving was in crisis before COVID,\u201d said Lindsay Jurist-Rosner, CEO of Wellthy, a workplace-benefits company in the Flatiron District that contracts with employers and advises employees on family-care issues. \u201cBut people are really struggling now.\u201d Said Jurist-Rosner: \u201cWhat we are hearing is, \u2018I am fine, but this is impacting my parents, my grandparents, my uncle with dementia, my sister with cancer or my kid who can\u2019t go to camp this summer. I need help managing that. And once I return to the office, what\u2019s the risk to my loved ones with chronic conditions? If they get exposed, what\u2019s next?\u2019\u201d These situations aren\u2019t close to rare in a nation where half the people have one or more chronic conditions such as diabetes, cancer or heart disease and where more people than ever live into their 80s, 90s and beyond. With nearly 40% of COVID-19 deaths traced to nursing homes, assisted-living centers and long-term care facilities, many families are trying to juggle these issues at home. But that raises a whole new set of questions: How do you keep mom safe and socially engaged? Who can you hire to look after dad? What safety measures are required at home? How will the aides, sitters and nurses commute back and forth? Oh, and who will pay for all this care? Are health insurance companies providing the benefits they should? Yikes! \u201cIt\u2019s a lot,\u201d Jurist-Rosner said. See: The coronavirus is devastating U.S. hospitals, which will lose $200 billion in revenue by the end of June Under Wellthy\u2019s model, each client is assigned a \u201ccare consultant,\u201d a social worker or nurse who helps manage these details. The cost is covered by employers, a workplace benefit that joins health insurance, family-leave time and 401(k)s in helping to retain valuable workers. But these are early days in the care-benefits world, and no one can say how these models might change. This much is certain as long as a global pandemic continues to ravage American life: Whatever the issues were before, they are a whole lot tougher now.
