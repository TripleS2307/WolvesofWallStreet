I loved it immediately. So\u2026I decided to write about it. I was tired. It had been a brutal mountain bike ride in the heavy heat of a Georgia summer; 2 1/2 hours of pounding the hills, burning 1,791 calories in the process (if my FitBit is to be believed). I had a nasty tumble on a steep descent down from the mountain top. My leg was bleeding, but my mind was clear. Crystal clear. I was tired, but content. There\u2019s nothing better than linking up with a reader and doing something I love, and I enjoyed meeting up with David for our mountain bike climb up to Boyd Gap Overlook, where we celebrated by having a passerby take our picture. Just another day in the life of retirement. Never bored. Outside, active, social. And sweaty. I seem to be sweaty a lot these days. It goes with an active life during a Southern summer, and I\u2019m good with that. It\u2019s the path I\u2019ve charted for my retirement. It\u2019s the life I\u2019ve chosen. As I was returning to our cabin from the trail, I slowed for the (one) stop sign in our small mountain community. It was then that I noticed the Jeep in front of me and smiled\u2026 Fritz Gilbert NVRBORD I sounded it out in my mind \u2026 Never Bored. I loved it immediately. Thoughts of my book came to mind, where I encouraged the reader to rephrase \u201cretire\u201d into \u201cRe-Tire\u201d, or the act of putting new tires on whatever type of vehicle you choose to become in retirement. For the first time in our lives, we\u2019re free to decide what type of vehicle we\u2019d like to become. I even mention that I\u2019d become a Jeep with big \u201cmudder\u201d tires, the better to explore our mountain surroundings. I meant what I wrote, and I followed it up by buying myself an old Jeep as a celebration when my book hit No. 1 on Amazon. But I left something out. Seeing the Jeep in front of me led to a realization. How could I have missed it? Not only should we choose the vehicle and the tires we\u2019d like to become in retirement, but we need to symbolically \u201cpersonalize our plates\u201d. The owner of that Jeep was genius, and his \u201cNVRBORD\u201d plate was a perfect symbol of an intentional life. Never bored. 7 short letters, but they told me all I needed to know. That person, whoever they were, lived life. I\u2019ve never been a big fan of personalized plates, but they make perfect sense in Re-Tirement. I would argue that \u201cpersonalizing our plates\u201d is an essential act in planning our retirement. Redefining who we are is critical as we move away from what we \u201cwere\u201d, and move toward what we are \u201cbecoming\u201d. I\u2019ve always encouraged Re-tirees to have a quick \u201celevator speech\u201d prepared on who they are in Re-Tirement. Me? I\u2019m an author. I\u2019m a traveler. I\u2019m an outdoorsman. But could I condense an elevator speech down to 7 letters? Challenge Accepted.What\u2019s Your Re-Tirement Plate? Since NVRBORD is taken, I\u2019ll have to find something else. The challenge has become personal for me, as I hope it will become for you. I had fun brainstorming ideas for this post. Here\u2019s what I came up with, along with my \u201cwinning\u201d entry. In reverse order, here are the 10 best ideas I could come up with for my personalized Re-Tirement plates: 10. RETIRED \u2014 Seems a bit predictable, and doesn\u2019t say enough about LIFE in retirement. 9. EMTNEST \u2013\u2013 Better, but still only one facet of the reality of our life. 8. NOOFICE \u2014 I don\u2019t miss going to the office, and I suspect I never will. 7. CYAWORK \u2014 See ya later, working days. Hello, Freedom! 6. 1FUNDAY \u2014 A weekly habit my wife and I recently started, a potential future post\u2026 5. HAVNFUN \u2014 Because, well, I can. 4. WONNDUN \u2014 We won the game, we\u2019ve crossed The Starting Line. But\u2026I\u2019m far from done. 3. LUVDOGZ \u2014 With 4 dogs in our life, this one fits pretty well. 2. OLDNFIT \u2014 I\u2019m more fit at 57 than I was at 50, hoping to stay that way til I\u2019m old. And the winner is\u2026 IN2LIFE \u2013 I\u2019ve decided that Re-Tirement is all about living life, and living it fully. Only seven characters, but they say a lot about how I\u2019ve chosen to live my life in retirement. I\u2019m 100% into life, and I\u2019m living it abundantly. I savor every moment, and I cherish each and every day I\u2019m given. Isn\u2019t that what all of us should be pursuing in Re-Tirement? With every sunset, there\u2019s one less day to enjoy and soon they will be no more. With no more work contaminating my freedom, I\u2019m finally able to be into life every day, in whatever way works for me. What better way to summarize it than those short 7 characters, IN2LIFE? They say, in a statement short enough to fit on a license plate, what my life is about now that I\u2019m Re-Tired. I\u2019m Into Life. Re-Tirement is a time to decide who you want to be. Not only the vehicle you\u2019d like to become, and not only the type of tires you\u2019d like to roll on. Your chosen Re-Tirement vehicle deserves your own set of personalized plates. Take the challenge. How would you summarize what you want your retirement to be, in 7 short characters? Mine? IN2LIFE What\u2019s yours?
