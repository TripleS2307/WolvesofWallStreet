Monday trading showed signs of a rotation away from high-growth stocks in the tech sector to more economically sensitive cyclical companies, a trend that has been subject to fits and starts over recent weeks. \u201cAs the summer COVID-19 spike wanes, investors are more inclined to view the economic recovery as real. That could mean the recent move toward cyclical stocks is real and sustainable for the first time since the pandemic began,\u201d said James Meyer, chief investment officer at Tower Bridge Advisors. Still, investors say it is unclear how far any nascent rally in cyclical companies might run, with the coronavirus still an obstacle that is weighing on the U.S. economic recovery and the feasibility of new fiscal stimulus measures announced by the Trump administration in question. Read: A \u2018sharper cyclical rally\u2019 could be in the cards, this analyst says The U.S. reached another dire milestone on Monday as new COVID-19 cases topped 5 million, more than one-quarter of the global total of nearly 20 million cases. Uneven efforts within the U.S. to contain the coronavirus come as the White House and Democratic lawmakers failed last week to come to an agreement on a new round of pandemic aid. In response, Trump on Saturday signed executive orders that aim to pause the collection of payroll taxes, provide help on rent, assist with student-loan payments and extend a portion of additional unemployment benefits that had lapsed at the end of last month. The measures are almost certain to face legal challenges and logistical hurdles. Specifically, one order authorizes states to pay $400 a week in additional unemployment benefits, with 75% of the funding coming from the federal government, versus the $600 in additional benefits that had expired at the end of July, which has been credited with helping borrowers and lenders, thus far, avoid a wave of consumer defaults. See:States would be on the hook for billions under Trump\u2019s jobless-benefits plan \u201cExecutive orders that spend money, or presumably cut taxes are fraught with peril,\u201d said Steven Skancke, chief economic adviser at Keel Point, and a former White House National Security Council and U.S. Treasury Department staffer. \u201cTo be sure, there have been efforts to try to do that,\u201d Skancke said, pointing to efforts by the Nixon administration to use line-item vetoes over spending he disagreed with from a policy standpoint. \u201cAll of that was overturned in the courts,\u201d he said, adding that the precedent doesn\u2019t bode well for Trump\u2019s efforts to override powers of Congress to tax and spend. \u201cThey certainly will be challenged, and as a result they don\u2019t provide certainty in terms of their impact,\u201d he told MarketWatch. Meanwhile, U.S.-China tensions intensified, with Beijing on Monday announcing unspecified sanctions against 11 U.S. politicians and heads of organizations promoting democratic causes, including additional measures targeting Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, who already were subject to a travel ban. Also, Chinese jet fighters briefly crossed the midline of the Taiwan Strait on Monday, news reports said, as U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar visited the island. Azar is the most senior U.S. official to visit Taiwan in around four decades. Earnings season also further winds down this week.
