The letter, sent from Mark F. Cannizzaro, president of the Council of School Supervisors and Administrators, urged the mayor and schools Chancellor Richard Carranza to begin the school year fully remote and delay in-person instruction until the end of September to allow for more time to train teachers on new safety measures, hire more school nurses and procure enough personal protection equipment (PPE). \u201cThe slow rollout of guidance has forced us to once again address an unfortunate truth: Schools will not be ready to open for in-person instruction,\u201d Cannizzaro said in his letter. He said that despite messaging from the mayor that reopening school was a collaborative effort, City Hall and the city\u2019s Department of Education have failed to address many of their concerns and \u201cignored repeated appeals from school leaders to allow enough time to implement highly complicated protocols.\u201d Coronavirus update: Global cases top 20.3 million, U.S. tally tops 5.15 million as Florida and Georgia see record one-day deaths While the city and state have mandated certain safety measures, it will be up to principals to implement them on a practical level in their individual schools. And yet, many still do not know when they\u2019ll receive necessary equipment, including thermometers, signage, hand sanitizer and other cleaning materials. They don\u2019t know the status of ventilation system updates, when nurses will be hired and if there will even be enough teachers to accommodate the proposed hybrid model, in which students learn a few days a week in class and the other days remotely, Cannizzaro said. He emphasized that the union fully supports bringing children back to the classroom this fall. \u201cSchool leaders speak with these families every day and will continue to stand with those parents asking for schools to return to in-person learning as soon as possible,\u201d he said, but the plan allows \u201cfrighteningly little time for the preparation and training necessary for these unprecedented times.\u201d The letter stopped short of saying principals or their staff would refuse to return unless certain concerns were met.

The city expects about 85% of its 66,000 educators to return to the classroom this year. \u201cI can say in New York City, we have teachers coming back and we\u2019re going to have the resources to serve our kids,\u201d de Blasio said. He also expressed confidence on Monday that four weeks was enough time to prepare the city\u2019s roughly 1,700 schools, and that nothing would open that wasn\u2019t safe. \u201cThere may be some classrooms or some specific parts within a building that still needs some work, but overall, I think we\u2019re going to be ready,\u201d he said. The city is preparing for about 700,000 public school students, or about three-fourths of the student body, to attend in-person classes in September. Parents of more than a quarter of a million students have enrolled in remote-only instruction. Growing concern that New York City is rushing into reopening schools comes amid similar criticism in New Jersey, which on Wednesday backed off plans for all districts to offer some form of in-person learning in the fall. In a reversal, Gov. Phil Murphy said that districts would be allowed to go all-remote in September if they chose, so long as they provide a plan and target date for returning to classrooms.
