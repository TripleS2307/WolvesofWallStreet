Additionally, remote learning, also originally slated to start on Sept. 10, will now commence on Sept. 16. The delay is part of an agreement reached between the city and the United Federation of Teachers, which was threatening a potential strike over safety concerns regarding in-person learning. The union\u2019s demands included mandatory testing in schools, which before today\u2019s agreement, was not a component of the city Department of Education\u2019s reopening plans. Details of the new reopening plan include: A mandatory monthly testing program in schools with in-person classes. \u201cEvery single school will have testing, it will be done every month, it will be rigorous,\u201d de Blasio said. \u201cAnyone who tests positive will, of course, be isolated, and that will trigger the Test and Trace apparatus.\u201d Regular deliveries of personal protective equipment to ensure that schools have a running 30-day supply at all times. This will include masks for both teachers and students. \u201cWe will replenish it every day so there\u2019s constantly a 30-day supply,\u201d said schools Chancellor Richard Carranza. \u201cNo question, that will happen.\u201d Schools will be allowed to purchase additional supplies at their own discretion. A week-long preparation period for teachers and other school staff from Sept. 10-14. A three-day \u201ctransitional period\u201d with remote-only classes will begin on Sept. 16, and blended learning with in person classes will start on Sept. 21. De Blasio described the delay as \u201ca revision that still allows us to keep things moving forward on a tight timeline but with additional preparation time.\u201d There are significant logistical concerns outstanding at individual schools, but the now-agreed-upon list of requirements and procedures should keep reopening plans moving forward, said UFT President Michael Mulgrew. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear to every school now. These are the supplies and equipment every school has to have, here are all of the procedures on how [reopening] works inside schools,\u201d Mulgrew said during the news conference with the mayor. \u201cWe could say that you need to use social distancing, but how many entrances are you using, which way are you moving people in and out, when is bathroom time? Those have to be figured out on an individual level, but we have a definitive list of what those are.\u201d Also see: This university created its own COVID-19 test and is testing students twice a week The UFT did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the city\u2019s latest steps, but released a fact sheet stating that school buildings that fail to meet safety requirements will remain closed. Mulgrew also lashed out at federal officials\u2019 overall response to the pandemic, saying, \u201cThe federal government completely failed to act yet had no qualms about standing up at press conferences saying how important it was for the schools to open. Shame on all of them.\u201d Currently, more than one-third of the city\u2019s 1.1 million public school students have chosen remote learning, with the option to enroll in blended classes in November. For the students planning to return to school, the mayor urged parents to \u201chave their children tested in advance of the start of classes.\u201dOther New York City news: 0.98% of COVID-19 tests in the state were positive on Monday, the 25th consecutive day that the statewide infection rate has remained below 1%. In New York City, 0.9% of tests on Monday came back positive. Gov.
