Curbside dining, delightful though it\u2019s been, won\u2019t be nearly as pleasant in January as it was all summer, even if City Hall is on the verge of making the outdoor eating permanent. Double hot chocolates! And hold the COVID-19, please! Starting Wednesday, the eating moves indoors. Some of it. Sort of. If the restaurants can figure out the details and the customers feel comfortable coming back in. Oh, and if Mayor Bill de Blasio doesn\u2019t blink. The resumption of public school classroom learning was delayed a couple of times. But so far everyone\u2019s sticking with the first wave of indoor dining next week, maximum occupancy 25% \u2014 and perhaps more to come. If the infection rate doesn\u2019t rise, Gov. Andrew Cuomo promises, restaurants may go to 50% after Nov. 1. And on Friday, de Blasio announced that the outdoor tables won\u2019t disappear at the end of October, as was previously planned. Now, they can remain in place permanently \u2014 or as permanently as anything can ever be in New York \u2014 in this case, through the winter and beyond. Going forward, propane heat lamps will also be allowed, so the entrees and the diners don\u2019t freeze. Coronavirus update: U.S. cases rise toward 7 million, after jumping by more than 45,000 in a single day But none of this is going to be easy for the city\u2019s 25,000 restaurants and bars, where employment is still less than half the 319,000 it was a year ago. \u201cIt\u2019s a dire time filled with tons of uncertainty,\u201d said Andrew Rigie, executive director of the New York City Hospitality Alliance, who has as clear an overview as anyone. \u201cThe 25% with a road map to 50%, hopefully by November, is a step in the right direction. But to be clear, 25% or 50% is not going to save the industry. It was difficult enough to survive pre-pandemic at 100%.\u201d How bad are things, even with the boost of outdoor dining and the coming of indoor? A Hospitality Alliance survey of 450 city restaurants found that 87% were unable to pay their full rent in August. Thirty-four percent paid no rent at all. That\u2019s a winning formula only for restaurants whose landlords are infinitely patient \u2014 and how common is that in New York commercial real estate? Each new step is hugely complicated. Even beyond the strict crowd limits, the restaurants must institute a menu of additional safety protocols that make a TSA strip search sound like a howdy-do. Temperature checks. Contact information for tracing. Face coverings when not seated. No bar service, and restaurants will have to close by midnight under the theory that the coronavirus gets extra frisky after 12:01 \u2014 or maybe it\u2019s that the post-midnight flow of alcohol can lead some diners to be incautious. Also on MarketWatch: Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade to go virtual this year No, going out to dinner has never been like this before. And no one knows if diners will still consider it fun. Four-hundred city inspectors will join a special state police unit to enforce the new rules, with shutdown orders in their pockets for restaurants that don\u2019t comply. It\u2019s a learn-as-they-go situation for every restaurateur, from the owner of the tiniest diner to the city\u2019s five-star chefs. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna do some little bungalows so people can feel protected from the wind, the snow,\u201d the legendary Daniel Boulud, who presides at Restaurant Daniel on East 65th Street, told WPIX-TV. \u201cThat should create a little bit of a transition and bring a little bit of excitement. We hope that 25% will keep us very safe. We are taking the great measure for that.\u201d Also see: Pandemic startups: These N.Y. entrepreneurs did the unthinkable during COVID-19 But will it be enough to save the industry and its jobs, not to mention a treasured part of New York City life? \u201cWe need ongoing support from all levels of government to give these small businesses a chance of survival,\u201d Rigie cautioned. \u201cEveryone has to power through it. People are doing the absolute best they can.\u201d Those establishments that have had outdoor tables have an advantage over those that haven\u2019t, according to the Hospitality Alliance director. \u201cPeople who have been closed for the past six months and will open for the first time will have a bigger learning curve,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be tough for everyone. But restaurants that have been outside already know how to serve people safely. They understand QR code menus. Mobile payments. These things are all going to help with the transition to indoor.\u201d Ellis Henican is an author based in New York and a former newspaper columnist."}]}
