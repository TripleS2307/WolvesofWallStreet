That\u2019s the conclusion of a stock market forecasting model that its author, with much justification, calls \u201cThe Single Greatest Predictor of Future Stock Market Returns.\u201d Based on the latest data from the Federal Reserve, released in late September, my updated version of this model forecasts that the dividend-adjusted S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% will beat inflation over the next decade by an annualized margin of just 0.59 percentage points. Add in expected inflation over the next decade of 1.35%, according to a model maintained by the Cleveland Federal Reserve, and you arrive at a nominal total return projection of 1.94% annualized. \u201c If the forecast is accurate, then the S&P 500 will produce a price-only annualized 10-year return of just 0.27%. \u201d To put that in perspective, consider that this projected return is less than one-fifth of the stock market\u2019s long-term average return of about 10% annualized. To put this forecast in another context, consider that the S&P 500\u2019s dividend yield currently is 1.67%, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. If the forecast is accurate, then the S&P 500 will produce a price-only annualized 10-year return of just 0.27%. Given where the S&P 500 was trading last June 30, this projection translates into the index trading at 3,185 on June 30, 2030. That\u2019s 2% below where it was trading in late September 2020. What is this model with such an impressive record? It is based on the average investor\u2019s equity allocation. The most recent Federal Reserve data we have is for the period ending June 30; of the total amount that investors owned in stocks, bonds or cash as of then, 43.2% was invested in stocks. That\u2019s markedly higher than the seven-decade average of 35% \u2014 as you can see from the chart below. The chart also shows the remarkable correlation between this average investor equity allocation and the S&P 500\u2019s inflation-adjusted total return over the subsequent decade. Note that the chart\u2019s right axis is inverted, with higher returns at the bottom and lower returns at the top. That\u2019s because higher average investor equity allocations are correlated with lower subsequent stock market returns. Credit for creating this indicator goes to the anonymous author of the Philosophical Economics blog. He justified his claim that it was the \u201cSingle Greatest Predictor of Future Stock Market Returns\u201d by calculating a statistic known as the r-squared. This statistic measures the extent to which one data series (in this case the average investor equity allocation) explains or predicts another (in this case the S&P 500\u2019s subsequent 10-year return). The r-squared was significantly higher than for any of the other well-known valuation indicators, such as the ratios of price to earnings, book value, sales, cash flow, dividends and so forth. I conducted similar statistical tests for a Wall Street Journal column I wrote two years ago. Average investor equity allocation indeed came out ahead of the seven other valuation indicators I analyzed. Upon updating those tests to include date through Jun. 30, the r-squared I calculate for the average investor equity allocation is an impressively high 71%. That means quarterly changes in that allocation predict 71% of quarterly changes in the S&P 500\u2019s subsequent 10-year return. No other indicator that I know of does a better job. (In fact, most of the indicators that capture Wall Street\u2019s attention have an r-squared that is statistically indistinguishable from 0.) Notice, however, that the indicator\u2019s 71% r-squared this means that 29% of quarterly changes in the stock market\u2019s 10-year return are uncorrelated with the average investor equity allocation. That gives the bulls a tiny bit of wriggle room to get out from the underneath the full weight of model\u2019s dismal projection. But only a tiny bit. The model\u2019s overall projection is clear: The stock market over the next decade will be a below-average performer. Mark Hulbert is a regular contributor to MarketWatch.
