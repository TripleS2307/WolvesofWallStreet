Prices for the metal rose \"on hopes of a partial U.S. coronavirus stimulus deal to support the virus-stricken economy,\" analysts at ICICI Bank said in a note. \"However, prevalent risk-on mood had undermined the prospect of further gains\" for the metal, they said. December gold GCZ20, +2.17% rose $4.30, or 0.2%, to settle at $1,895.10 an ounce. Prices settled at $1,890.80 on Wednesday, the lowest most-active contract settlement since Sept. 28, according to FactSet data."}]}
