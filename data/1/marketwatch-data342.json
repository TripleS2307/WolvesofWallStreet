AFP via Getty Images Stocks finished higher Wednesday after President Donald Trump signaled late Tuesday that he was open to a number of separate fiscal stimulus measures, only hours after calling off talks with congressional Democrats on a relief package until after the November election. At the same time, investors said they were looking past the current legislative wrangling in Washington, eyeing the year ahead when the passage of a stimulus package to support the economic recovery and a working vaccine was more likely.

Stocks found some buying momentum on Wednesday, during a chaotic week punctuated by mixed messages out of Washington on the status of fiscal stimulus talks. A little more than an hour before Tuesday\u2019s market close, Trump in a tweet accused congressional Democrats of negotiating in bad faith and announced that he had pulled the plug on stimulus talks until after the election. Hours later, however, in another flurry of tweets, Trump said that he would immediately sign individual stimulus measures, if sent to him, including a round of $1,200 individual stimulus checks and a package of $25 billion in airline payroll support and $135 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses which he said could be paid for out of unused funds from the Cares Act. See: Mnuchin and Pelosi resume discussions after Trump changes course on fiscal stimulus Trump\u2019s two-hour late evening tweet spree lifted equities, but analysts said a path to a another round of fiscal stimulus still appeared unclear. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi talked on Wednesday morning, with Pelosi saying she was open to relief for airlines but not the stimulus checks proposal. \u201cMarkets had become resigned to the fact that we weren\u2019t getting anything,\u201d said Will Geisdorf, senior research analyst with Sarasota, Florida-based Allegiant Private Advisors. He attributed the positive tone for stocks over roughly the past week to hopes that talks between the White House and congressional Democrats had became more serious. \u201cWall Street is not Main Street,\u201d Geisdorf said in an interview. \u201cMain Street is in a much worse position if we see the next stimulus pushed off, because a lot of companies will need to make another round of job cuts.\u201d But even as the prospects of a stimulus package this year look increasingly rocky, the expectation is that either Trump or Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden would unroll aggressive stimulus measures in 2021.

Minutes of the Federal Reserve\u2019s September policy meeting showed senior Fed officials thought the U.S. economy was recovering faster than expected, but many had penciled in another stimulus package before the end of this year. Without additional spending, Fed officials expected the recovery to slow more than anticipated.
