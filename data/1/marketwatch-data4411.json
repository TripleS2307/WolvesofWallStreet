If you get COVID-19 and struggle to breathe, would you want to be put on a ventilator? Whatever your answer, ask yourself another question: Who would make your wishes clear if you couldn\u2019t speak for yourself? Advance directives \u2014 an umbrella term that includes living wills and health care proxies or powers of attorney \u2014 are legal documents that all of us need but that many of us don\u2019t have. A living will allows you to tell your loved ones and medical providers what kinds of medical care you want at the end of your life. Health care proxies or powers of attorney allow you to designate someone to make medical decisions for you if you can\u2019t communicate. You need both, since not all medical situations will trigger a living will, says Carolyn McClanahan, a physician and certified financial planner in Jacksonville, Florida. \u201cA living will only really kicks in if you have an end stage process, a persistent vegetative state or a terminal illness,\u201d McClanahan says. \u201cOftentimes people run into a situation where they have a health event, but it\u2019s not something that\u2019s going to kill them.\u201d When her father suffered a massive stroke at age 78, Desiree Fisher of New York used the health care power of attorney he\u2019d created two years earlier to push for interventions and therapy to help him recover. Seven years later, he\u2019s doing well, she says.

Many sites, including AARP and Everplans, offer links to free forms for each state. Five Wishes offers an interactive version for $5. McClanahan likes the free advance directive forms at Prepare for Your Care, a site founded by Rebecca Sudore, a geriatrician and professor at the University of California, San Francisco. The Prepare for Your Care site focuses on the quality of life you want \u2014 what you value about your life and what would make you want to go on living, or not. \u201cThe problem that too many advance directives get into is they\u2019re asking people about medical procedures that they don\u2019t quite understand,\u201d McClanahan says. People also worry that their choices are set in stone, which isn\u2019t true, says CFP Linda Rogers of San Diego. \u201cIf you want to change something tomorrow, you can change it. But put something down on paper, otherwise the courts or the hospital could decide for you,\u201d Rogers says.Pick your advocate and a backup When choosing the person who will make decisions for you, consider who would be most capable of advocating for what you want, rather than what they, other family members or a medical provider might want.

Because they love you so much, they may not follow your wishes,\u201d McClanahan says. Choose at least one backup person in case your first choice can\u2019t serve and make sure these advocates understand your wishes, says Susan M. Mitcheltree, a CFP in Timonium, Maryland. Give copies of the documents to them and talk about what you want. \u201cYou will never cover every situation,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, the more information you can give your health care agent, the better they will be able to best honor your wishes.\u201dShare your plans Follow your state\u2019s rules, included with the forms, about how to make these documents valid, such as having witnesses sign or getting the paperwork notarized. Once you\u2019ve done that, store the originals in a secure place at home, along with your will, and tell your family where to find them. Your doctor and attorney should have copies as well. Ask your doctor to include the forms in your electronic health record, so other medical providers can access it in an emergency. Also carry a card in your wallet that has your health care agent\u2019s name and contact information, along with where you keep the originals and copies. If your choices could cause discord in your family, consider including a note explaining your thinking, Mitcheltree says. \u201cEven if they disagree with your decisions, it is more comforting to hear it directly from you as opposed to the person you have appointed on your behalf,\u201d she says.More from NerdWallet: SmartMoney Podcast: \u2018Is Identity Theft Protection Worth It?\u2019 Money Mistakes Happen.
