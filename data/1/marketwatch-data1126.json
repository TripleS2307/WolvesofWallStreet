Last year, sales totaled $1.132 trillion for the same three-month period. Deloitte LLP forecasts a 1% to 1.5% rise for the period between November 2020 and January 2021. \u201cThe traditional November-December holiday-season definition is meaningless this year\u2014and, I would argue, for the future as well. For years now, holiday sales have been pulled forward earlier and earlier, thanks mostly to the explosion in online shopping,\u201d said Joel Bines, global co-leader of the retail practice at AlixPartners. \u201cThe pandemic has accelerated what was well on its way to happening anyway.\u201d Berkeley Research Group forecasts that October 10, or 10/10/2020, will be the official start of the holiday shopping season this year, thanks to the marketing possibilities as well as the possibility that Amazon.com Inc.
