In its quarterly Sakura Report, Japan's equivalent of the Federal Reserve's Beige Book, the BOJ said only the island of Shikoku has yet to begin a recovery from the sharp slowdown earlier this year. It said the economy in the Tokyo area \"has started to pick up\" but remains \"in a severe situation.\" It used similar language for most of Japan's other regions.
