Japan\u2019s benchmark Nikkei 225 NIK, -0.11% added 0.9% to 23,636.35. South Korea\u2019s 180721, +0.21% ained 0.2% to 2,391.63. Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 XJO, +0.00% jumped 1.4% to 6,119.20. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng HSI, -0.30% fell 0.8% to 24,048.48. Trading was closed in Shanghai for a holiday. Riki Ogawa of Mizuho Bank in Singapore noted that considerable uncertainty remains, given the \u201crollercoaster\u201d swings in investor mood in response to signs from Trump about the stimulus. \u201cThe on-and-off nature of the fiscal stimulus discussion in the U.S. hardly inspires lasting confidence,\u201d Ogawa said, noting such uncertainty will continue through the presidential election campaign, and perhaps even after the vote. The S&P 500 climbed 1.7% to 3,419.45 after Trump sent a series of tweets late Tuesday saying he\u2019s open to sending out $1,200 payments to Americans, and to limited programs to prop up the airline industry and small businesses. The tweets came just hours after Trump sent the market into a tailspin with his declaration that his representatives should halt talks with Democrats on a broad stimulus effort for the economy until after the election, claiming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had been negotiating in bad faith.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% gained 1.9%, to 28,303.46. The Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39% climbed 1.9%, to 11,364.60, despite a call by Democratic lawmakers for Congress to rein in Big Tech companies that dominate it and other indexes. The proposal, which follows a 15-month investigation by a House Judiciary Committee panel, could make it harder for Amazon AMZN, +3.01%, Apple AAPL, +1.74%, Facebook FB, +0.26% and Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet GOOGL, +1.82% GOOG, +1.97% to acquire other companies and impose new rules to safeguard competition. Still, much of the market\u2019s attention remains fixed on the prospects for more stimulus for the economy from Washington. Airlines jumped to some of the day\u2019s bigger gains after Trump singled out the industry, asking Congress to \u201cIMMEDIATELY\u201d approve $25 billion for them. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% rose broadly, with technology stocks making the biggest gains. Other areas that would benefit most from a strengthening economy were also climbing, including retailers and travel-related companies.

The Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks RUT, +0.55% climbed 33.75 points, or 2.1%, to 1,611.04. The 360-degree spin for Wall Street in less than 24 hours is just the latest bump in its shaky run since early last month.
