The EUA option was put into place during the pandemic to speed up the arrival of new tests, treatments, and vaccines; however, once the U.S. ends the public health emergency, the EUA is no longer valid. Four COVID-19 vaccine candidates are currently in Phase 3 clinical trials, including candidates developed by AstraZeneca's AZN, +1.16% AZN, +0.63% and the University of Oxford, BioNTech BNTX, +1.23% and Pfizer Inc. PFE, -0.27%, Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +1.39%, and Moderna Inc. MRNA, +0.09%."}]}
