On Tuesday, the stock tumbled 10.8% in premarket trading, after investors were surprised by S&P Dow Jones Indices announcement late Friday its new S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% components didn't include Tesla, as was widely expected. \"Unclear why [Tesla] was not included in the recent rebalancing cycle, though we do think the stock will be eventually added to the S&P 500, having fulfilled all inclusion criteria,\" Baird analyst Ben Kallo wrote in a note to clients. The stock has still soared 400% year to date through Friday, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% has tacked on 6.1%."}]}
