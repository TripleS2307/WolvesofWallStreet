In an interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Kudlow suggested that the rise in cases stemmed from increased testing and that increased hospitalization numbers were from a resumption of elective surgeries. \u201cAlthough the case rate has increased a bit, we\u2019re not talking about a second round here,\u201d Kudlow said. \u201cFatality rates continue to be very low,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is probably the ultra-key metric.\u201d \u201cThe country has got to open,\u201d he said, returning to a theme the White House and allies have voiced in past months: \u201cThe costs of not opening may exceed the costs of closing down. I think we\u2019re on the right track here.\u201d Kudlow painted an upbeat forecast for the economy. \u201cWe are on our way \u2014 we are reopening,\u201d Kudlow said. He said the economy was at a \u201cturning point.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of positive, green-shoot indicators,\u201d he said. Kudlow predicted \u201ca big, big\u201d increase in retail sales in May. The government will release those data on Tuesday. Economists surveyed by Econoday expect a rebound of 7.5% after a 16.4% decline in the prior month. In addition, the Apple mobility index, which tracks the movement of consumers, is \u201cpractically prepandemic,\u201d Kudlow said. \u201cThis economy is now in the recovery stage \u2014 that\u2019s the key point I want to make this morning,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there is a very good chance you are going to get the V-shaped recovery, and I think the second half of the year ... will be a good 20% economic growth and the unemployment rate will fall,\u201d he added. A V-shaped recovery refers to a quick snap-back in economic growth rather than a slower sustained rebound. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has been more cautious, telling reporters this week that there would be a \u201clong road\u201d before the economy is fully recovered. Kudlow said the White House was against extending the extra $600 a week in unemployment benefits that people out of work have been able to collect on top of what they get from their state. This benefit expires at the end of July. And he defended Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin\u2019s decision not to release the names of the recipients of the $660 billion in small-business loans under the government\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program.
