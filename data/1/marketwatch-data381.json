Samuel Corum/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images Calls from clients usually start pouring in whenever stocks take a surprise tumble. But lately, financial advisers have been getting more calls from worried clients about devastating West Coast wildfires, which this year come amid the worst public-health crisis in a century. \u201cWe always get a lot of calls after a bear market hits,\u201d said Deron McCoy, chief investment officer at Signature Estate & Investment Advisors, in Los Angeles. \u201cClients always ask what they should do.\u201d His advice? Plan ahead before calamity strikes, particularly if you live in spots vulnerable to climate change, which now threatens to make California\u2019s wildfires even worse. \u201cYou need to fix your roof when it\u2019s sunny,\u201d he said. Well over 4 million acres have burned in California since the beginning of the year, more than double the land burned in any prior year, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. For McCoy, that means urging clients not to get caught in a position where they become forced sellers when anything bad happens \u2014 a tall order this year. \u201cDon\u2019t have your living expenses in stocks,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t have December\u2019s rent in Tesla TSLA, +1.89%. \u201d More broadly, Silicon Valley workers should probably diversify from a portfolio construction standpoint. \u201cThey love their tech, but their homes also are tied to tech bonuses,\u201d McCoy said. Some aspects of preparing for a disaster can be counter intuitive. For example, booming stay-at-home technology stocks, including Apple, Inc. AAPL, +1.74%, Google parent Alphabet GOOG, +1.97% and Facebook, Inc. FB, +0.26%, have been clear benefactors during the pandemic. But this year also saw idyllic Bay Area tech campuses shrouded in thick smoke and ash from Northern California\u2019s raging wildfires. Smoke from wild Bay Area hit by near Justin Sullivan/Getty Images \u201cIf you live in harm\u2019s way, you might not want to have all your investments there,\u201d McCoy said. Bay Area homes fetched record prices in August even with the coronavirus and wildfires, with existing single-family homes selling for a median price of nearly $1.07 million, almost a 19% annual price increase, according to a report from the California Association of Realtors. That compares with a gain for Facebook shares of 26% year to date Tuesday, while Alphabet\u2019s were 8.7% higher and Apple\u2019s surged 54.1% over the same stretch, according to FactSet data.

Absolutely not,\u201d said Luis Strohmeier, a partner and wealth adviser at Octavia Wealth Management. \u201cIt isn\u2019t like Japan where they do drills monthly.\u201d To better prepare, Strohmeier recommends that his client call their home\u2019s original builder or architect to pinpoint the strongest part of a house. \u201cEvery house has an area that likely would withstand the worst of an earthquake,\u201d he said. \u201cUnderstanding that is important.\u201d But in terms of risk coverage, he also said earthquake insurance policies can help, but they often are expensive and come with high deductibles, meaning that only a fraction of homes currently are covered. There\u2019s also the risk of earthquake-related fires. To that end, Strohmeier also likes to see his clients upload all of their deeds, legal documents and estate planning materials in an electronic vault and their valuables, including cash and jewelry, to be stored in a fireproof safe.Role of companies While the pandemic has required many companies to keep their employees working remote, that doesn\u2019t mean businesses have any less responsibility to their employees, or investors, during a disaster. \u201cThe biggest thing is to protect vital assets and to have a business continuity plan in place,\u201d said Dr. Louis Gritzo, manager of research at FM Global, a business property insurance company. He said the warming trend of the climate also means many corporations will need to beef up their existing disaster plans and communicate them better to employees. FM Global survey in 2012 found that 75% of U.S. workers felt their employer was not well prepared for a natural disaster. \u201cGenerally, people don\u2019t have a a lot of confidence that they\u2019re going to have a job after a crisis occurs, whether that\u2019s an earthquake, wildfire or flood,\u201d Gritzo said. \u201cThey\u2019re not quite sure their company\u2019s going to be there. And that plan needs to be communicated.\u201d Related: Evacuating due to hurricanes or wildfires? Put these items in your \u2018financial go-bag"}]}
