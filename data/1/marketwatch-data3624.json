The decision from U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth is a victory for Bolton in a court case that involved core First Amendment and national security concerns. But the judge also made clear his concerns that Bolton had \u201cgambled with the national security of the United States\u201d by taking it upon himself to publish his memoir without formal clearance from a White House that says it was still reviewing it for classified information. \u201cDefendant Bolton has gambled with the national security of the United States. He has exposed his country to harm and himself to civil (and potentially criminal) liability,\u201d Lamberth wrote. \u201cBut these facts do not control the motion before the Court. The government has failed to establish that an injunction will prevent irreparable harm.\u201d From a practical perspective, the ruling clears the path for a broader election-year readership and distribution of a memoir, due out Tuesday, that paints an unflattering portrait of President Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policy decision-making during the turbulent year-and-a-half that Bolton spent in the White House. Soon after the ruling was released, Trump tweeted that Bolton \u201cbroke the law by releasing Classified Information (in massive amounts). He must pay a very big price for this, as others have before him. This should never to happen again!!!\u201d Bolton\u2019s lawyers insisted that Bolton had spent months addressing White House concerns about classified information and that Bolton had been assured in late April by the official he was working with that the manuscript no longer contained any such material. Bolton\u2019s team said the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to block the book were a pretext to censor him for an account that the White House found unfavorable. The Justice Department sued this past week to block the book\u2019s release and to demand that copies be retrieved. Officials said the book contained classified information and that Bolton had failed to complete a prepublication review process meant to ensure former government officials do not improperly disclose national security secrets in books they write. The administration submitted written statements from multiple officials attesting to the national security concerns of releasing the book. The judge did not take issue with those concerns in his 10-page order. But with 200,000 copies of the book already distributed to booksellers across the country, attempting to block its release would be futile, the Lamberth wrote. Major media organizations also obtained the book and published comprehensive accounts about it. \u201cIn taking it upon himself to publish his book without securing final approval from national intelligence authorities, Bolton may indeed have caused the country irreparable harm. But in the Internet age, even a handful of copies in circulation could irrevocably destroy confidentiality,\u201d Lamberth wrote. Just one individual with a book in hand could publish its contents from a local coffee shop, he said. \u201cWith hundreds of thousands of copies around the globe \u2014 many in newsrooms \u2014 the damage is done. There is no restoring the status quo,\u201d the judge wrote. Lamberth appeared divided during arguments on Friday. He observed that Bolton had not waited for official assurance from the White House that the book was free of classified information. But Lamberth also suggested that he was powerless to halt the book\u2019s release given that hundreds of thousands of copies had already been shipped. \u201cThe Room Where it Happened: A White House Memoir\u201d depicts a president whose foreign policy objectives were inexorably linked to his own political gain. Bolton says Trump \u201cpleaded\u201d with China\u2019s Xi Jinping during a 2019 summit to help Trump\u2019s reelection prospects. Bolton writes that Trump linked the supply of military assistance to Ukraine to that country\u2019s willingness to conduct politically charged investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter \u2014 allegations that were at the heart of an impeachment trial that ended with Trump\u2019s acquittal by the Senate in February. Bolton\u2019s lawyers argued that he had labored painstakingly for months with the White House to address concerns over classified information. In late April, the career official he worked most closely with and who had done a line-by-line edit notified him that she had completed her revisions and that the revised manuscript did not contain classified information. But another White House official soon after embarked on an additional review and identified material that he said was classified. Bolton\u2019s lawyers say the White House assertions of classified material were an attempt to censor him over a book the administration simply finds unflattering. \u201cIf the First Amendment stands for anything, it is that the Government does not have the power to clasp its hand over the mouth of a citizen attempting to speak on a matter of great public import,\u201d Bolton\u2019s attorneys wrote in a court filing. Trump on Thursday called the book a \u201ccompilation of lies and made up stories\u201d intended to make him look bad. He tweeted that Bolton was just trying to get even for being fired \u201clike the sick puppy he is!\u201d Other administration officials who figure prominently in the book, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, denied comments or actions that were attributed to them and joined the president in condemning the book. Even Democrats who pounced on some of Bolton\u2019s anecdotes to condemn the president nonetheless expressed frustration that he had saved them for his book instead of participating in the impeachment case. Bolton refused to voluntarily testify in the impeachment inquiry, and the House ultimately moved forward with its case without subpoenaing him."}]}
