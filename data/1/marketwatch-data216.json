In one case, a Florida man allegedly used a $4 million loan in part to purchase a $318,000 Lamborghini Hurac\u00e1n EVO. In another case, former professional football player Joshua Bellamy allegedly received a $1.2 million loan, part of which he spent at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Florida and on high-end jewelry. A large share of fraudulent loans were approved by lenders with close ties to financial technology companies, including Cross River Bank and Celtic Bank Corp., the analysis showed. Cross River Bank declined to comment and Celtic Bank did not immediately responded to a request for comment. A Tuesday report from Bloomberg Businessweek said that fintech companies \u201chandled 75% of the approved PPP loans that have been connected to fraud by the U.S. Department of Justice,\u201d despite the fact that those companies arranged only 15% of PPP loans overall. A September report by the Miami Herald pointed to online lender Kabbage as the source of more than 15 fraudulent loans. \u201cPrograms of such scale as the PPP will see challenges,\u201d Kabbage spokesperson Paul Bernardini told the paper. \u201cThe SBA\u2019s guidance had lenders rely on PPP applicants to provide data they attested to be true and accurate, including their date of incorporation.\u201d The Paycheck Protection Program does rely on \u201cself-certifications\u201d whereby originating banks are allowed to rely on borrowers\u2019 own attestations that economic uncertainty related to COVID-19 made the loans necessary to maintain payroll and make mortgage, lease and utilities payments. According to a July report from the Government Accountability Office, \u201cTo streamline the process, SBA required minimal loan underwriting from lenders\u2014limited to actions such as confirming receipt of borrower certifications and supporting payroll documentation\u2014leaving the program more susceptible to fraudulent applications.\u201d These lax underwriting standards were thought to be necessary to encourage banks to participate in the program. If banks were held responsible for preventing fraud on the front end of the program, the fear was that they would be wary of participating the program at all, or would at least be dangerously slow in disbursing much needed relief. Meanwhile, placing these allegations of fraud in the context of the overall size of the program is revealing. The POGO analysis shows that just $113 million were successfully obtained by those accused of fraud, a small fraction of the roughly $500 billion disbursed by the SBA. POGO identified that Cross River Bank processed 15 allegedly fraudulent loans, also a small fraction of the roughly 200,000 PPP loans the bank issued, according to SBA data. For comparison\u2019s sake, the Special Investigator General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, set up to stabilize the financial system in the wake of the 2008-2009 crisis, recovered $11 billion in ill-gotten gains out of a roughly $700 billion program."}]}
