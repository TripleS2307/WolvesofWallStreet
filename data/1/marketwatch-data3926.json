Democratic front-runner Joe Biden released his \u00e2\u0080\u009cBuy American\u00e2\u0080\u009d economic plan to challenge President Trump. Still, investors need to ask how Biden would pay for the plan. He could take away Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tax cuts for corporations and the rich. But Biden and Trump might also share a strategy: Borrow more and influence the Federal Reserve to print more money. Readers know that I am politically agnostic. My sole job is to help investors. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s explore the issue by reviewing the Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF DIA, +0.57%, which tracks the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56%. Note the following: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Based on Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tax policies, the stock market in theory could drop, and it could find support at a buy zone. That would be 20% lower than where it is today. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Prudent investors should protect themselves. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 From 2012 to today, the majority of the rise in the stock market is attributable to the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enlarged balance sheet and lower interest rates. Please see \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the case for Dow 30,000 in Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first term.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 The big money is hiding in the five large-cap tech stocks of Apple AAPL, +1.74%, Amazon AMZN, +3.01%, Microsoft MSFT, +2.48%, Alphabet GOOG, +1.97% \u00c2 GOOGL, +1.82% \u00c2 and Facebook FB, +0.26%. Those five stocks are experiencing a significant \u00e2\u0080\u009cpile-on\u00e2\u0080\u009d effect \u00e2\u0080\u0094 buying for reasons that have nothing to do with fundamentals. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Keep an eye on stocks that would benefit from the Biden plan. Examples include Tesla TSLA, +1.89%, Canopy Growth CGC, +2.49% \u00c2 and Centene CNC, -0.74%. Five contributors to a stock market drop Here is a simple calculus of what, in theory, should happen with Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tax policy. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Biden would be likely to increase the capital gains tax, perhaps as high as 39% for upper-income individuals. That could lead to selling before such a law were passed. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Due to higher corporate tax rates, S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% \u00c2 earnings would take about a 7% hit. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Due to more regulation, S&P 500 earnings would take a 2%-3% hit. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Potential restrictions on buybacks and also less free cash flow due to higher corporate taxes would be a negative for the stock market. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 With wealthy individuals paying more taxes, they would have less money to buy stocks. All in all, the foregoing calculates to about 20% hit to the stock market.New stock market highs None of it may matter, and the stock market may hit new highs, if the following two factors take hold: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 If Biden starts surging in the polls along with the possibility of a \u00e2\u0080\u009cblue sweep,\u00e2\u0080\u009d expect market professionals and hedge funds to build up short positions. Short positions act as fuel for a rally if subsequently a short squeeze takes hold. Some 65% of the first leg of the rally from the March 23 coronavirus low was short-squeeze-related. The second leg of the rally was 35% short-squeeze-related. If a short squeeze takes hold again, it could easily take the stock market to new highs. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 An up move due to a short squeeze these days goes a lot farther due to the momentum crowd jumping on. The momentum crowd has already formed a habit of buying stocks aggressively on the news of more government borrowing and more money printing. With more borrowing under the Biden administration, the prevailing wisdom among the momentum crowd that more borrowing and more money printing is good may lead to new stock market highs. What does it all mean? Prudent investors need to stay extra alert and nimble as well as have protective measures in place while positioned to take advantage of potential new stock market highs. Protective measures should be dynamically adjusted. Of course, if you are part of the momentum crowd, it is real easy \u00e2\u0080\u0094 celebrate borrowing and money printing with more buying in the stock market.
