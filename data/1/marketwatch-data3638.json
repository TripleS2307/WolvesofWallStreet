We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll grow faster if we do those things well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kaplan said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd right now, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relatively uneven.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Fed officials say they are doing all they can to help the economy recover. There is an undercurrent of concern in their comments over how efforts to stem the pandemic, normally outside the purview of central banking, are going.

Texas is one state seeing rising coronavirus cases, especially in Austin and Houston. Kaplan said that officials assumed there would be more coronavirus cases as part of the reopening. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe thing we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re watching is \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are there so many cases it is overwhelming the health-care system \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not seeing that at all here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. The Dallas Fed president said the unemployment rate was on its way down. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to get positive job growth in June, July from here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. However, even with the job growth, the jobless rate will finish the year at 8% or higher, he said.
