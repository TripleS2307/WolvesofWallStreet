On Monday, IBM IBM, -2.81% beat analysts\u2019 expectations, which were revised with the knowledge that the COVID-19 pandemic had taken a toll on some of its customers\u2019 purchasing power, but still showed large declines in earnings and revenue. Big Blue\u2019s new chief executive, Arvind Krishna, said it was tough to give guidance in the current backdrop, but failed to lay out much of a pandemic plan that goes beyond his predecessor\u2019s path, at least for now. IBM stock was up more than 5% in after-hours trading Monday when the results were announced, but those gains eventually dissipated in Tuesday trading. That is because there was little to suggest an improvement from the company\u2019s prospects three months ago, when IBM closed at a lower price than the going rate and sank after the report. In fact, IBM\u2019s outlook has probably worsened in the past three months. \u201cIt\u2019s likely that we see that the economic recovery is looking to be longer and more protracted than we might have hoped for back in March,\u201d Krishna said in Monday\u2019s earnings call, in which he did not provide a financial forecast. Krishna needed to voice how IBM is reacting to that dynamic, but largely failed to do so. The CEO took over for Ginni Rometty earlier this year, and has largely kept to the mantra of hybrid cloud \u2014 backed by the acquisition of Red Hat Inc. \u2014 and artificial intelligence that defined the end of her reign. Despite the pandemic\u2019s arrival not long after Krishna took over, little has changed, despite COVID-19 likely making pure cloud a better play than hybrid cloud and IBM\u2019s legacy tech. See also: Tech has been a pandemic savior and been richly rewarded. So what happens now? \u201cWe see opportunity in hybrid cloud, we see opportunity in digital transformation. We see opportunity in people as they\u2019re doing a return to the workplace and projects that all advance those things,\u201d Krishna said. \u201cSome of those give long-term benefit, some give them short-term benefit.\u201d While IBM keeps talking about the cloud, right now its cloud business is focused on hybrid cloud, with its large base of entrenched customers using legacy systems and software. Hybrid cloud is where companies with their own massive systems keep part of their data on premise and move part of their data to be managed by another company. Krishna said the pandemic is accelerating the shift to hybrid cloud systems by many customers. But pure cloud-service providers are faring far better in the pandemic, as more companies look to move their entire computing operations to Amazon\u2019s AMZN, +3.01% AWS, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +2.48% Azure and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOG, +1.97% GOOGL, +1.82% Google Cloud. Many companies are not doing a full return to the workplace and won\u2019t anytime soon, and some are letting their employees work from home until at least the end of the year. That trend appears to suit Amazon and Azure, and it\u2019s clear now that every company needs some kind of cloud strategy. IBM is hoping its hybrid stance will keep its legacy customers happy, but it may have a hard time attracting new ones in the current environment. Additionally, Krishna and his team are continuing down IBM\u2019s well-worn path of major cost-cutting to help lower expenses. IBM has quietly been cutting jobs, which it refers to as \u201cworkforce rebalancing\u201d in its regulatory filings and the charts that accompany earnings press releases. On the conference call, Chief Financial Officer Jim Kavanaugh referred to \u201cstructural actions\u201d that will help earnings going forward, especially in its services business. Read: S&P 500 earnings set to plunge as the coronavirus batters all sectors \u201cSavings from our structural actions will start to yield in the second half, providing better cost competitiveness and margin performance, especially in GTS [global technology services],\u201d he said. Since Krishna became CEO in late January, IBM has cut an unspecified yet seemingly large number of jobs. In the first quarter, IBM took a $728 million charge for workforce rebalancing, according to its most recent 10Q from late April. In the second quarter, IBM took another $140 million charge for workforce rebalancing, but did not specify how many jobs were cut or moved to other businesses as a result. An IBM spokesman said it announced structural actions during its earnings call in January, to reposition its global services business, and that the charges in the first and second quarter are part of that same announcement. IBM ended 2019 with about 352,000 people, and yesterday said it would hire 1,000 paid interns from inner-city schools, as part of a program to diversify its tech talent. But the spokesman declined to say how many jobs IBM has cut, adding that IBM only reports its employee population at the end of the year. One Wall Street analyst wrote Tuesday that she believes the pandemic may be delaying even more aggressive moves by Krishna, which she believes are necessary for a complete turnaround. More from Therese: This Wall Street analyst turned his Twitter feed into \u2018Sell-Side Stories with Stacy\u2019 \u201cAlthough IBM should fare relatively well through a recession, the pandemic will delay new-CEO Krishna\u2019s ability to take more aggressive strategic actions to turn around IBM\u2019s business (e.g., divestitures, acquisitions, radical restructuring) \u2014 in our view, essential to the success of the turnaround \u2014 and in the meantime, the company will continue its slow, difficult decline,\u201d wrote MoffettNathanson Research analyst Lisa Ellis, in a note. In an email, Ellis estimates IBM\u2019s job cuts in a range of 5,000 to 10,000, and said that she believes the new CEO needs to do more, such as potentially splitting up services and/or legacy products, to focus on its higher growth opportunities. \u201cWe believe that IBM should consider \u2014 not saying it is the right answer, but should be seriously evaluated \u2014 breaking up the company, splitting the services businesses apart from products; potentially separating the growth products (like Red Hat) away from the legacy platforms that are stable, but declining and can be run for cash,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cAs a new CEO in a turnaround situation, we believe Arvind should \u2014 and arguably has a fiduciary duty to \u2014 evaluate some more drastic options.\u201d While the pandemic does make it harder to make big moves, it does not preclude an executive from confidently laying out the path forward he expects to take. At Big Blue, though, that path seems to be \u201cWhatever we already had planned, and layoffs that we won\u2019t talk much about,\u201d which simply isn\u2019t good enough for investors to have confidence in the future."}]}
