Wednesday's action was marked by a return to the trades that have worked throughout the pandemic, large-capitalization tech stocks and stay-at-home companies, which have lead the rally back from the coronavirus lows in March. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% closed about 6 points shy from a record close, ending at around 3,380, based on preliminary levels. That narrowly misses the Feb. 19 closing high at 3,386.15. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% finished up 1.1% at 27,977, also on a preliminary basis. Meanwhile, the technology-laden Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.39% resumed its dominance, which had seemed to fade in recent days, finishing up 2.1% at 11,012. Recently, investors had appeared to shift away from tech names and into beaten-down sectors like financial and energy but that action subsided on Wednesday."}]}
