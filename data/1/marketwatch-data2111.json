Some of the legislative candidates have repeatedly shared QAnon memes and interacted extensively with social-media accounts promoting the conspiracy \u2014 which is centered on the baseless belief that President Donald Trump is waging a secret campaign against enemies in the \u201cdeep state\u201d and a child sex trafficking ring. Others have acted in ways that leave it unclear whether they believe in the theory or may be merely flirting with the ideas to garner attention. They make up a tiny share of the thousands of state legislative candidates on the ballot in November and many are longshots, but several, including in Arizona, Minnesota and Wisconsin, are running in competitive districts. Among those who have engaged with QAnon postings on social media is Dave Armstrong, a Republican candidate for the Wisconsin Assembly. He was asked to run for the seat by the incumbent, a fellow Republican. As the overlap between support for President Donald Trump and adherence to the \u201cQAnon\u201d conspiracy theory has increased, Trump has been called upon to disavow it, as Vice President Mike Pence and Trump\u2019s presidential rival Joe Biden have done. He has pointedly refused. The FBI has flagged QAnon as a domestic-terrorism threat. Associated Press While he does not describe himself as a QAnon adherent, he has liked and forwarded videos made by QAnon backers. Armstrong told the Associated Press that he finds core aspects of the conspiracy credible, but not all of it. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll ever know the answer to that, nor can we prove it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest thing with QAnon is you can\u2019t prove any of it.\u201d John Ellenson, Armstrong\u2019s Democratic opponent for the seat, said it would be \u201cdangerous\u201d to elect Armstrong because he \u201cplays in conspiracies and not the truth.\u201d The conspiracy theory has been creeping into the mainstream political arena. It gained wider attention after Marjorie Taylor Greene won the Republican primary for a U.S. House seat in a heavily GOP Georgia district last month. Greene was invited to the White House for Trump\u2019s acceptance speech during the Republican National Convention. Trump has said he knows little about the movement but has spoken favorably of its followers. Vice President Mike Pence has dismissed it. Former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump\u2019s Nov. 3 rival, last week called it mortifying and dangerous. While races for congressional seats often generate more publicity, state legislative positions serve as springboards to higher office, and their holders wield significant power to affect everyday life \u2014 determining state policies on education, policing, health care, criminal justice and other issues. As with many conspiracy theories, it\u2019s not always clear how much of it the candidates believe. Through the AP\u2019s statehouse reporters, the nonprofit research group Media Matters for America and Democratic groups involved in state legislative races, the news cooperative identified about two dozen candidates in more than a dozen states who have expressed some level of support or interest in QAnon. That number is only the roughest of estimates. Some who had shared messages referencing the conspiracy sought to put distance between themselves and the movement when contacted by the AP. Many simply did not return requests for comment \u2014 perhaps not surprising given that the movement proclaims the mainstream media is in on the conspiracy. Among those was Suzanne Sharer, a Republican legislative candidate in the Phoenix area who has posted QAnon videos and messages more than a dozen times in recent months. She is running in a suburban district that once was solidly Republican but has been trending Democratic. In April, she wrote: \u201cQ has been quiet. Is this 10 days of darkness?\u201d Julie Buria, a Republican running in a northern Minnesota legislative district that Trump carried by nearly 3 percentage points in 2016, retweeted at least four posts in April and May that seemed to support QAnon. In one she wrote: \u201cLink to new Q drop\u201d with a link to a QAnon site. The tweet also used several hashtags common to the conspiracy\u2019s followers. But in an interview, Buria insisted she was not very familiar with QAnon. \u201cHave I looked at it? Yes. Do I believe all of it? No. I\u2019m not really sure what to think about all that,\u201d she said. Whether or not candidates believe in QAnon, they are lending the ideas legitimacy by sharing them, said Jenny Guzman, legislative communications coordinator for Progress Arizona, a liberal group that has worked to draw attention to candidates sharing conspiracy theories. \u201cI think that Republicans very clearly know what they\u2019re doing when they\u2019re engaging and spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories,\u201d Guzman said. \u201cBut when they get caught, they\u2019re trying to play ignorant because they just don\u2019t want to face accountability for their actions.\u201d Most of the legislative candidates identified by the AP as having some history of posting about QAnon are Republicans, though some are independent or third-party candidates. Some are not shy about their interest in the movement. On her Twitter account, Melissa Moore has included a picture of Earth inside the letter Q with the slogan, \u201cThe World is About to Change,\u201d that is common among the movement\u2019s followers. She has also used several Q-associated hashtags in her tweets. A delegate to the Republican National Convention, she is running in a Democratic-leaning district in suburban Minneapolis. \u201cI like following it,\u201d Moore said. \u201cIt\u2019s an exciting movement that opens up our minds to different possibilities of what\u2019s going on, of what\u2019s really happening in our world today.\u201d In Nevada, independent state Assembly candidate John Cardiff Gerhardt also openly embraces the movement. He said he suspected government officials, the mainstream media and the criminal justice system were conspiring to cover up human trafficking even before he became familiar with QAnon. \u201cHiding behind the curtain where everything seems to be fine and dandy, there\u2019s actually executives, CEOs, pop stars and the top politicians, including the past few presidents before Donald Trump,\u201d said Gerhardt, who is running in a heavily Democratic district of eastern Las Vegas. Gerhardt said his main focus is to replace the state constitution. A draft proposal integrates elements of the conspiracy, including an official recognition that a \u201cCabal\u201d is attempting to \u201ccontrol & corrupt the State of Nevada.\u201d"}]}
