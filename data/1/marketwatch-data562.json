(AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump will begin his Independence Day weekend on Friday with a display of fireworks at Mount Rushmore, an event expected to draw thousands where masks and social distancing aren\u2019t required as coronavirus cases spike across the country. Trump is expected to speak at the event, which has issued 7,500 tickets to watch fireworks that he says will be a \u201cdisplay like few people have seen.\u201d The president will likely enjoy a show of support, with the state Republican Party selling T-shirts that feature Trump on the memorial alongside George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt. But concern about the coronavirus risk and wildfire danger from the fireworks, along with protests from Native American groups, will also greet the president. Republican Gov. Kristi Noem, a Trump ally, has said social distancing won\u2019t be required during the event and masks will be optional. Event organizers will provide masks to anyone who wants them and plan to screen attendees for symptoms of COVID-19. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain suggested in a tweet that people were fed up with face-mask guidance and that facial coverings would not be mandatory at the Mount Rushmore event \u2014 and ended up hospitalized for the coronavirus disease himself a day later. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } The Republican mayor of the largest city near the monument, Rapid City, said he is watching for a spike in cases after the event, the Rapid City Journal reported. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have thousands of people, shoulder to shoulder at these events \u2014 someone in line to see a president and being able to see fireworks at Mount Rushmore \u2014 they are probably not likely to disqualify themself because they developed a cough the day of or the day before,\u201d the Rapid City mayor, Steve Allender, said. Cable-news reports on Friday showed a spectator-seating scheme with no nod to social distancing.

Some Native American groups are using Trump\u2019s visit to protest the Mount Rushmore memorial itself, pointing out that the Black Hills were taken from the Lakota people against treaty agreements. Protests are expected in Keystone, the small town near the monument. Chase Iron Eyes, a spokesman for the Oglala Sioux president, said protesters would like to make their voice heard at the memorial itself, but it\u2019s not clear they\u2019ll be able to get close. \u201c \u2018What can burn? It\u2019s stone.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 President Trump, when asked about the risk that fireworks could ignite wildfires Security is expected to be tight, with the road leading up to Mount Rushmore shut down. The governor\u2019s spokesperson, Maggie Seidel, would not say whether the South Dakota National Guard was being deployed, but said organizers are making sure it is a safe event. But several people who once oversaw fire danger at the national memorial have said setting off fireworks over the forest is a bad idea that could lead to a large wildfire. Fireworks were called off after 2009 because a mountain pine beetle infestation increased the fire risks. Noem pushed to get the fireworks resumed soon after she was elected, and enlisted Trump\u2019s help. The president brushed aside fire concerns earlier this year, saying, \u201cWhat can burn? It\u2019s stone.\u201d The National Park Service studied the potential effect of the fireworks for this year and found they would be safe, though it noted that in a dry year, a large fire was a risk. Organizers are monitoring the fire conditions and were to decide Friday if the fireworks are safe. Trump made no mention of the fire danger in fresh comments Thursday. \u201cThey used to do it many years ago, and for some reason they were unable or unallowed to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just weren\u2019t allowed to do it, and I opened it up and we\u2019re going to have a tremendous July 3 and then we\u2019re coming back here, celebrating the Fourth of July in Washington, D.C.\u201d Trump has presided over a several large-crowd events \u2014 in Tulsa, Okla., where attendance was dramatically lower than the Trump re-election campaign expected, and at an Arizona megachurch \u2014 even as health officials warn against large gatherings and recommend face masks and social distancing.
