Goldman Sachs analysts have mapped out the expected responses of key assets to various trade war scenarios, including more tariffs. The estimates are based on analysis of seven tariff announcements aimed at China in 2019, three of them intensifying and four reducing the tariff risk. They said an unexpected $10 billion increase in U.S. tariffs on China would lead to an estimated 1.2% decline in the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% \u00c2 and a 2.2% fall in Chinese equities, while USD/CNH USDCNH, -0.71% \u00c2 would rise 0.7%. The 1.2% decline in the S&P 500 was large in comparison to the tariff threat itself, they said, as a $10 billion increase in U.S. tariffs would only account for 0.5% of corporate profits. The disproportionate response was down to the perceived threat of Chinese retaliation and broader risks to trade policy. Conversely, a $30 billion reduction in tariff revenue would lead to an estimated 4% rise in the S&P 500. Analysts Dominic Wilson and Vickie Chang said the estimates could be used to benchmark the potential impact of a Joe Biden presidency versus a Trump second term. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA second Trump term would likely see some prospect of continued, and perhaps increased, fear of ongoing tariff increases, particularly given the deterioration in U.S.-China relations over the course of the last few months,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile a Biden presidency is unlikely to improve the outlook for the broader U.S.-China relationship, it is less likely a new administration would regard tariffs threats as the \u00e2\u0080\u009cweapon of choice\u00e2\u0080\u009d and might instead favor a more multilateral approach,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they added. Goldman said the impacts estimated were only those due to trade policy alone, but also said trade policy shifts under Biden could mitigate pressure on U.S. stocks from potential corporate tax changes.
