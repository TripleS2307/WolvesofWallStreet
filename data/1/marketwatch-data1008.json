The Republican incumbent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign and its affiliates have brought in more money from donors than Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side has in the 2020 cycle so far, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also spent more, so the Democratic and GOP sides now are close in their cash on hand. The MarketWatch chart below shows how much has been raised and shelled out by Biden and Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s principal campaign committees, as well as by the two politicians\u00e2\u0080\u0099 joint fundraising committees with their respective parties. The joint committees \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the Biden Victory Fund, Biden Action Fund, Trump Victory Committee and Trump Make America Great Again Committee (also known as T-Magic) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 can accept six-figure donations, while the most that you can give to a candidate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main campaign committee is $2,800, though it can total $5,600 if you contribute for both the primary and general elections.

But he also noted that pro-Biden outside groups, such as super PACs like Priorities USA Action and the Lincoln Project, have combined to pay out about $2.50 for every $1 pro-Trump groups have spent. The additional chart below shows the reported cash on hand as July started for Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign ($238 million) vs. the cash remaining for the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s effort ($295 million). The totals are based on figures as of June 30 from the two politician\u00e2\u0080\u0099s principal campaign committees, their joint fundraising committees, and they also include the Democratic National Committee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cash on hand and the Republican National Committee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cash remaining. The party committees are spending in support of not only their presidential candidates, but their Congressional candidates as well. If the DNC and RNC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resources aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t included, the Biden team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reported cash on hand is $201 million vs. $195 million for Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s effort. A campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial reports are a closely watched measure of viability, along with polling data. Trump also often touts the performance of the stock market SPX, +0.87% \u00c2 DJIA, +0.56%, which hit all-time highs in February but since then has traded below its peaks amid worries over the coronavirus pandemic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic effects. In a RealClearPolitics moving average of national polls as of Tuesday, Biden drew support of 49.3% of voters, ahead of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 40.7%. During the contest to become the Democratic Party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidential nominee, Biden lagged behind rivals such as Bernie Sanders in his fundraising. But after that contest ended in early April, the former vice president managed to outpace Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fundraising for the second quarter, even as the president still has raised more overall in the 2020 cycle.
