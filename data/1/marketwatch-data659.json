The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee detailed his plans in a speech in Wilmington, Del. It was the latest in a series of policy proposals to be rolled out by the former vice president, as the U.S. continues to battle the coronavirus pandemic. Investments in clean energy are a \u201cwin, win, win for this country,\u201d Biden said, \u201ccreating jobs, cutting energy costs, protecting our climate.\u201d The plan represents a more aggressive proposal from Biden, and comes after a task force that includes former primary rival Sen. Bernie Sanders recommended the 2035 target date. \u201cWe\u2019re not just going to tinker around the edges,\u201d Biden said Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make historic investments and seize the opportunity and meet this moment in history.\u201d From the MarketWatch archives (January 2020):Microsoft aims to be \u2018carbon negative\u2019 by 2030 See also:The Biden-Sanders climate-change policy pact: 8 key features During the Democratic primary, Biden offered a $1.7 trillion plan with the goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. With the pandemic expected to have a long-lasting effect on the U.S. economy, Biden says his plan is aimed at \u201ccreating the jobs we need to build a modern, sustainable infrastructure now and deliver an equitable clean energy future.\u201d Biden, as he had earlier in his campaign, pitched in his Tuesday speech the need for a \u201csecond great railroad revolution\u201d for both passenger and freight transport, including halving the duration of an Amtrak trip from New York to Washington and initiating or reinvigorating high-speed-rail projects in California, the South, the Midwest and elsewhere. The longtime daily Amtrak rider\u2019s campaign site notes that the U.S. has fallen well behind such countries as France, Spain and China, among others, in high-speed passenger rail. Biden has pledged to reverse the 2017 Republican tax-code overhaul to pay for his policy proposals. Hogan Gidley, the Donald Trump re-election campaign\u2019s national press secretary, likened the Biden plan to \u201ca socialist manifesto,\u201d telling the Washington Post that it \u201cpromises to massively raise taxes, eliminate jobs in the coal, oil or natural gas industries, and crush the middle class. He\u2019s pushing extreme policies that would smother the economy just when it\u2019s showing signs of roaring back.\u201d Read on:Fact checking the Republican claim that Biden plans to defund the police, and Biden\u2019s claim that Trump put brake on coronavirus tests"}]}
