TSLA, +1.89% shot up 9.8% in afternoon trading, to propel them above the $1,800 mark for the first time, after an upbeat call from Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. The stock has now rocketed 31.9% over the past four days, after the electric vehicle maker announced a 5-for-1 split of its common stock. While that sounds like a big gain over such a short time, this would mark the eighth time the stock has produced a 30+% rally in four days this year, the biggest being a 52.7% rocket ride in the four days ended Feb. 4, in the wake of a better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings report. Telsa's market capitalization has reached $337.8 billion after the current 4-day surge, which is more than triple the combined market caps of General Motors Co. GM, -0.15%, Ford Motor Co. F, -1.36% and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. FCAU, -0.95%, which is about $93.68 billion. Tesla's stock has run up more than fourfold (up 333.4%) year to date, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% has tacked on 4.7%."}]}
