FEW Spirits The bottle: FEW Spirits Cold Cut Bourbon, $44.99 The back story: It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no secret that we love our bourbon \u00e2\u0080\u0094 sales of the classic American-made whiskey hit an all-time high of $1.78 billion in 2019. And we also love our coffee, with the cold-brew style gaining in popularity of late. So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perhaps inevitable that some enterprising spirits company would finally combine the two sips into one. That company is FEW, an Illinois-based distillery that started almost a decade ago, making just a few cases (hence, the name, though the company also notes, with tongue-in-cheek, that F.E.W. are the initials of Frances Elizabeth Willard, a pioneer of the temperance movement). FEW founder Paul Hletko points out that coffee-flavored spirits are hardly anything new, but he says that Cold Cut Bourbon represents a different idea. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really about the bourbon, which, like much whiskey, is produced at a potent level \u00e2\u0080\u0094 aka cask strength \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and then cut with liquid to bring it down to something easier to drink. Typically, that liquid is water, but FEW decided to experiment with using cold-brew coffee. The result is Cold Cut Bourbon, a sip that Hlekto says has \u00e2\u0080\u009clayers upon layers of flavor and nuance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Since the bottle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s release almost a year ago, it has become a strong seller for FEW, especially of late. Monthly sales have averaged 30% growth since April, the company says. What we think about it: This is a one-of-a-kind bourbon \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and a tasty one to boot. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a smooth sip \u00e2\u0080\u0094 you get a mouthful of what FEW rightly describes as \u00e2\u0080\u009ccorn sweetness and oak,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but the coffee is decidedly there in the background, adding richness and spice. The bottle is so unique that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d hesitate to call it your everyday go-to bourbon, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitely one worth trying. How to enjoy it: The FEW team suggests this is a perfect after-dinner drink \u00e2\u0080\u0094 when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too late for a cup of coffee and you \u00e2\u0080\u009cdon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessary want dessert.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perhaps too boozy (93 proof) as an alternative to your morning cup. Then again, if you want a strong drink in the morning, FEW also makes a Breakfast Gin."}]}
