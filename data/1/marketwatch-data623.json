That list of warning signs has gotten longer. Three more potential symptoms of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 have been added to the CDC\u2019s list. They include: Congestion or runny nose Nausea or vomiting Diarrhea In April, the CDC flagged several other warning signs, ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness, which can develop two to 14 days after exposure to the virus. They include: Chills and repeated shaking with chills Fatigue Muscle or body aches Headache Sore throat New loss of taste or smell Those are in addition to the original three symptoms: Fever Cough Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing This expanded list of warning signs is significant because some testing sites may require a patient to show symptoms before they can be tested.
