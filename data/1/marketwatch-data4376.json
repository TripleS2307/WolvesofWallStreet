The French energy-management group's net profit in the period ended June 30 came in at 775 million euros ($908 million), down from EUR993 million in the previous-year period. Revenues decreased 10.5% organically on year to EUR11.58 billion. Schneider Electric said it reinstated guidance for the full year and now expects revenue to fall between 7% to 10% organically, and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and amortization margin to fall by between 50 basis points and 90bps organically. Goals for the medium term were reiterated, with organic revenue growth of between 3% to 6% on average, adjusted Ebita margin at around 17% by 2022, and free cash flow around EUR3 billion on average. It also re-established its share buyback program but said it will continue to act consciously as it expects uncertainties to continue in the second half of the year. The company said it remains committed to its portfolio optimization for disposals of revenue of between EUR1.5 billion to EUR2 billion. The timeline, however, will likely be delayed by one year due to the current crisis. Write to Giulia Petroni at giulia.petroni@wsj.com"}]}
