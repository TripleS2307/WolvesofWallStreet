Whether you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for a small family vehicle or just a nice commuter, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sure to find the right SUV for you on this list. Here are the best compact SUVs of 2020, ranked.1. Toyota RAV4 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 $25,950 The\u00c2 Toyota RAV4\u00c2 has always been a class leader in compact SUVs, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just as true in 2020 as ever. The RAV4 does just about everything well, with a ton of standard safety and infotainment technology, a fuel-efficient engine and a comfortable, well-designed interior. We love the variety in the RAV4 model range with the exciting TRD Off-Road trim and various hybrid trims available like the XSE, which is both efficient and sporty. Our only complaint is that the starting MSRP is a little high for this class, but the base trim is well-equipped. The current RAV4 is fresh off a redesign, and this version is the best RAV4\u00c2 Toyota TM, -0.65% \u00c2 \u00c2 has ever made.\u00c2 Check out: A first look at Toyota\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new RAV4 plug-in hybrid2. Honda CR-V \u00e2\u0080\u0094 $24,450 The Honda CRV Honda The\u00c2 Honda CR-V\u00c2 comes in a very close second to its longtime Toyota rival, mainly because the RAV4 has a more efficient hybrid model and more sophisticated standard safety technology. Still, you can see our ratings show them to be very evenly matched. The CR-V has many strengths that make the\u00c2 Honda HMC, -1.21% \u00c2 \u00c2 a better crossover for some drivers, like a lower starting price, a super spacious interior and a more refined base engine. The CR-V got some nice updates for 2020, including standard Honda Sensing safety tech on every trim, revised styling and an efficient new hybrid model.\u00c2 See: Comparing the 2020 Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V: Which is better?3. Mazda CX-5 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 $25,190 Mazda CX-5 Mazda The athletic\u00c2 Mazda CX-5\u00c2 offers something a little different in the compact crossover segment while still having mainstream appeal. It has a decidedly premium look and feel inside and out that makes it more upscale than its modest price tag suggests. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a blast to drive at any speed, with terrific handling and plenty of muscle from its optional turbocharged engine or its base engine, which is both lively and efficient. Some driver-assist technologies become newly standard for 2020, which helps keep this\u00c2 Mazda MZDAY, -1.05% \u00c2 \u00c2 competitive.\u00c2 4. Subaru Forester \u00e2\u0080\u0094 $24,495 The Subaru Forester Subaru The\u00c2 Subaru FUJHY, -1.41% \u00c2 Forester\u00c2 is on the rugged side of the compact SUV segment while still being a perfectly pleasant crossover to drive on the street. Some off-roaders compromise road manners for capability, but you get a generous helping of both off-road performance and on-road smoothness with the Forester. The interior is roomy, the safety ratings are strong, and the fuel economy is excellent, especially considering the standard all-wheel drive on every trim. For a practical, small SUV that can get a little adventurous, the Forester is a tough value to beat.\u00c2 5. Kia Sportage\u00e2\u0080\u0094 $23,990 Kia Sportage Kia Value is the name of the game with the affordable\u00c2 Kia Sportage. No matter which trim you go with, from the base LX up to the SX Turbo, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting a tremendous bang for your buck with this\u00c2 Kia\u00c2 crossover. The ride is smooth and comfortable, and the interior space is pretty generous for passengers. Newly standard for 2020 is an 8-in infotainment system with Android Auto and Apple AAPL, +1.74% \u00c2 CarPlay and more driver-assist features like forward-collision warning with pedestrian detection and a driver condition monitor.\u00c2 6. Chevrolet Equinox\u00e2\u0080\u0094 $23,800 The Chevy Equinox Chevrolet The\u00c2 Chevrolet Equinox\u00c2 is another value choice in compact crossovers. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little tight on space compared with rivals, meaning it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the best for families, but if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just looking for a small, affordable crossover for commuting and running errands, the Equinox is worth a look. Fuel economy is great from the base engine, but you have the option of upgrading to a bigger, more powerful turbocharged engine that is still pretty good on gas while turning up the fun factor. The Equinox has a generous host of standard driver-assist tech, including automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping assist and more.\u00c2 7. GMC Terrain\u00e2\u0080\u0094 $25,000 The\u00c2 GMC Terrain\u00c2 is mechanically identical to the Equinox and has a bit more of a premium vibe, especially in the upper trims like the Denali model. Being so similar to the Equinox, it shares many of the same pros and cons, like an efficient base engine, a strong optional engine, generous standard safety tech and being a little on the smaller side for cargo space. The range-topping Denali trim is very nice but gets into the same pricing territory as crossovers from more prestigious luxury brands. If you like the idea of the Equinox but want something a little different, the Terrain is a handsome alternative.\u00c2 Be sure to read: How to choose trim levels and options when buying a new car8. Jeep Wrangler\u00e2\u0080\u0094 $28,295* The Jeep Wrangler. Jeep The\u00c2 Jeep Wrangler\u00c2 retains its status as an off-road icon in 2020. The current JL generation of the Wrangler is the most practical and road-friendly Wrangler ever, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still compromising some on-road manners to pay for off-road performance. The trade-off is worth it if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re planning on doing some serious off-roading. If your hobby is getting as far off the grid as possible, get a Wrangler no matter what. You get your choice of a naturally aspirated V6, a turbocharged inline four or a torquey turbo-diesel V6, all of which come standard with 4-wheel drive. Take off the doors, take off the top, fold down the windshield, and have some fun.\u00c2 9. Volkswagen Tiguan\u00e2\u0080\u0094 $24,945 The VW Tiguan Volkswagen The\u00c2 Volkswagen Tiguan\u00c2 brings quirky\u00c2 VW VWAGY, +0.14% \u00c2 \u00c2 character to a practical compact crossover. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the few compact SUVs available with three rows of seats, but that third row is tight on legroom and takes up quite a bit of cargo space. The third row is standard on the FWD Tiguan and optional on AWD models. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only one engine option, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bit underwhelming in terms of both performance and fuel economy. This VW gets more standard and available technology for 2020, including available wireless charging and Wi-Fi hot spot capability. An overall premium experience combined with excellent road manners is why we put it just above the\u00c2 Rogue\u00c2 and\u00c2 Escape.\u00c2 Also see: 8 affordable new cars priced well below $20k10. Ford Escape\u00e2\u0080\u0094 $24,885 The 2020 Ford Escape SE Sport Hybrid Ford The Ford Escape is all new for 2020 and finishes in the middle of our compact SUV rankings. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re impressed with the cavernous interior space (although some interior materials feel a bit cheap) and the super-efficient new hybrid model. The optional turbocharged 4-cylinder EcoBoost engine is awesome, but we wish\u00c2 Ford F, -1.36% \u00c2 \u00c2 would give us an ST performance trim of the Escape like the bigger Ford crossovers. The 8-speed automatic transmission can sometimes hunt for gears, but it yields good fuel economy.\u00c2 11. Nissan Rogue\u00e2\u0080\u0094 $25,300 The Nissan Rogue Nissan The Nissan Rogue sits toward the bottom of our compact SUV rankings not because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bad crossover, but because it uses an aging design and just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t very competitive with the best compact SUVs. The Rogue is on the bigger side of this segment, which means you get a lot of cargo space for a compact SUV. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty generous with standard features, which help to make it a strong value. One of our biggest complaints is the Rogue\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weak sole engine option, which feels underpowered at high speeds. If you like\u00c2 Nissan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s NSANY, -1.50% \u00c2 \u00c2 vibe but want a little less car and a lower price, look into the Rogue Sport.\u00c2 12. Hyundai Tucson \u00e2\u0080\u0094 $23,550 The\u00c2 Hyundai HYMTF, -0.02% \u00c2 Tucson\u00c2 is a good compact crossover, but it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a whole lot to make it stand out. The driving experience is a bit dull \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even if you opt for the more powerful optional engine \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the fuel economy is subpar. The Tucson does offer a pretty good value with its list of standard technology, which includes a 7-in infotainment system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay plus some modern driver assistance technology like automatic emergency braking and lane-keeping assist.\u00c2 Also see: 8 new luxury SUVs for under $50,00013. Jeep Compass\u00e2\u0080\u0094 $22,280 The\u00c2 Jeep Compass\u00c2 straddles the line between compact and subcompact SUV, which is part of the reason why it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the most affordable SUV on this list. The Compass has a rugged, outdoorsy attitude, especially in the capable Trailhawk trim, but it has its share of drawbacks. Its sole engine option is sluggish, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inefficient for its size, and it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come with much standard safety technology like many of its rivals. If you want to live the\u00c2 Jeep\u00c2 life, the Compass is a good first step into the iconic brand, but most drivers will be more satisfied with one of its rivals or a used Wrangler.\u00c2 14. Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross\u00e2\u0080\u0094 $22,995 The Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross Mitsubishi The\u00c2 Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross\u00c2 is a bold attempt at bringing the name of an iconic sports car to a practical SUV, but it barely misses the mark. This\u00c2 Mitsubishi MSBHF, -0.44% \u00c2 \u00c2 has a cool design inside and out, an affordable price tag, great packaging and pretty good fuel economy, but there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t much more praise we can give it than that. The Eclipse Cross is a decent value, but the overall execution just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as elegant as some rivals that charge just a little more. If you want an affordable new crossover that turns heads, the Eclipse Cross will get attention, but almost all of its rivals are better SUVs.\u00c2 Also see: The 10 best new car models of 202015. Jeep Cherokee\u00e2\u0080\u0094 $25,840 Jeep Grand Cherokee Altitude Jeep The\u00c2 Jeep Cherokee\u00c2 was pretty cool when it was reintroduced in 2014, but it has lost most of its luster since then and is due for a full redesign. As you would expect from a Jeep, it delivers excellent off-road capability when equipped with AWD, especially in the rugged Trailhawk trim. However, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not planning on doing a lot of off-roading, you should look elsewhere. The base engine is weak, cargo space is tight, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just not as upscale or as agile as more modern competitors in this segment, many of which are more affordable. On the other hand, the Cherokee is good-looking.\u00c2 Also see: These 3 EVs are the lowest cost to own over 5 years This story originally ran on Autotrader.com."}]}
