In a lower-for-longer world, investors are looking for any edge they can find, and some ETFs may offer a bit more yield. But in addition to that fundamental backdrop, there may be a more straightforward explanation for investor interest in shares of bond funds: the Federal Reserve. In March, amid the coronavirus selloff, the central bank said it would buy ETFs in order to stabilize the financial system \u2013 namely, the bond market. Dave Nadig, an ETF industry veteran now at ETF Trends, set out to analyze the Fed\u2019s footprint in the market. Read: The Fed is going to buy ETFs. What does it mean? The Fed may well have achieved its goal better than anyone could have expected, Nadig concluded. That\u2019s because actual Fed purchases of ETFs has been a lot smaller than the overall inflows. \u201cThe Fed did exactly what it wanted to do here \u2014 buying just enough on the open market to convince the Street that they would be the buyer of first and last resort, and bringing investors along for the ride,\u201d Nadig wrote. Here\u2019s how the big numbers break down. There have been flows of $150.1 billion into bond ETFs through August 31 (about $132 billion of that is U.S. funds). As of the end of August, however, the Fed had only bought $8.7 billion worth of such funds.

But overall inflows were strong in April, since the Fed had announced its intentions in the prior month. Flows did abate a bit in August, though. Now that some of the dust has settled since March, the bigger question remains: is it healthy for the central bank to have such an outsize impact on financial markets? That \u201cwill have to be settled over the long game,\u201d Nadig wrote. \u201cBut short term? You\u2019d have to say mission accomplished.\u201d Read next: ETFs, born from 1987 market crash, are so far making 2020 less awful"}]}
