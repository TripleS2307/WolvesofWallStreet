It must seem even scarier to everyday Americans who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think they can\u00c2 count\u00c2 on Social Security. A recent Tweet caught my eye. It linked to an\u00c2 article\u00c2 about the problems with the so-called\u00c2 4% rule. As you might recall, the 4% rule states that, if you withdraw 4% of your portfolio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s value in the first year of retirement and thereafter step up the dollar amount withdrawn with inflation, you have a good shot at making your money last 30 years. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the problem with the 4% rule? The article mentioned that people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t spend the same amount each year, past investment results may not predict future returns and people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s finances could be upended by major life changes. Meanwhile, others have argued that the rule is\u00c2 outdated. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the problem? Interest rates aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t what they used to be, plus individuals may not feel comfortable with the assumed investment mix. Getting worried? Yet other\u00c2 critics\u00c2 say the 4% rule results in retirees not spending enough, thereby leaving an unnecessarily large estate. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m guessing that isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a problem for most. Still, it seems we have critics saying that the 4% rule leads to both too little spending and too much. Neat trick, wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you say? I was particularly puzzled by the criticism that people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t spend the same amount each year. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re living on a pension or Social Security, your spending will also vary from year to year. So why is this criticism directed at the 4% withdrawal rate? If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re managing your own income flow, at least you have flexibility not found with a fixed monthly pension. For many people, the key retirement planning question is, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow much income can I count on for the rest of my life?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assume you were earning $50,000 a year before you quit the workforce and you want that same income in retirement. First, subtract your Social Security benefit from the $50,000. That might leave you needing to generate $32,000 a year from savings. To that end, you could buy an immediate fixed\u00c2 annuity\u00c2 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll pay $32,000 a year for life. Today, that annuity would\u00c2 cost\u00c2 a 65-year-old man around $550,000. Alternatively, you could manage the money yourself. Based on the 4% rule, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d need to retire with $800,000 to generate $32,000. The good news: Unlike the annuity, the 4% rule should result in a growing income stream. For instance, after withdrawing $32,000 in the first year of retirement, you might pull out $32,960 in year two, assuming 3% inflation. Still, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a tradeoff. With the annuity, you have guaranteed income for life\u00e2\u0080\u0094but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve turned over $550,000 to an insurance company and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve left yourself vulnerable to inflation. Meanwhile, with the 4% rule, there are no guarantees. Maybe your annual income will rise with inflation and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll leave excess funds to your heirs\u00e2\u0080\u0094or maybe you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll run out of money and die broke. Keep in mind that nothing says you have to withdraw the exact sum specified by the 4% rule. If you need less, take less. Alternatively, take the amount based on the formula from your long-term investment portfolio, but add some of the money to your emergency fund. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give you a financial buffer if, say, we have a year with a significant market downturn and withdrawing the full amount specified by the 4% rule doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem prudent. Here are five additional pointers: In addition to the nest egg you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll use to generate income, aim to start your retirement with a reserve fund. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re using the 4% rule, modify it annually based on your spending needs. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need the full inflation increase? Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take it. Make sure your living expenses are less than your expected income, so you have some wiggle room. Budget for health care. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a big item, but not as big as some suggest. You see projections that retirees will spend hundreds of thousands on\u00c2 health care. Maybe, maybe not. The predictable annual cost is what matters. For most, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be\u00c2 Medicare\u00c2 Part B and D premiums, plus\u00c2 Medigap\u00c2 premiums. Yes, Medicare does involve some modest out-of-pocket costs. But the real wildcard is\u00c2 long-term\u00c2 care. It won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t affect many, but those affected could face huge costs: About 2.4% of the population over age 65 is in a nursing home, though many of those are there on a temporary basis. Read: 5 things to know about medical care in retirement Consider combining an\u00c2 immediate\u00c2 annuity with retirement assets where you use the 4% rule. That way, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have steady income from Social Security and the annuity\u00e2\u0080\u0094but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll still retain control of part of your nest egg. As you navigate all of this, you will have the added complication of taking required minimum distributions (RMDs) from your retirement accounts. Interestingly, the RMD\u00c2 schedule\u00c2 starts close to 4%. At age 72, the required withdrawal rate is 3.9%, rising to 4.37% at age 75, 5.35% at age 80 and 6.76% at age 85. The upshot: There may be those who say that withdrawing 4% plus an inflation increase is too much, and yet the IRS effectively insists that retirement account investors withdraw that sort of amount\u00e2\u0080\u0094though just because the IRS insists doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean you have to spend the entire sum. Is any retirement income guidance totally reliable? I doubt it. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll inevitably need to make adjustments along the way. Still, I think the 4% rule is helpful. My advice: Be more conservative than the rule suggests\u00e2\u0080\u0094and, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re married, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doubly true, because you need to make your money last for two lifetimes.
