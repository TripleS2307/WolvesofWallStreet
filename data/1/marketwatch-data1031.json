Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s re-election campaign has characterized Minnesota as a battleground state that it hopes to win, after the president lost there four years ago by just 1.5 percentage points. But Biden has a 10.2-point advantage in a RealClearPolitics moving average of polls focused on the North Star State, and the last Republican presidential candidate to carry it was Richard Nixon in 1972. The former vice president on Friday continued his attacks on Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s handling of the coronavirus crisis, saying that on one day in September there were a thousand deaths from the virus in the U.S., but zero \u00e2\u0080\u009cjust across the border\u00e2\u0080\u009d in Canada. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo many lives lost unnecessarily because the president is only worried about the stock market and his re-election,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Biden said in a speech at the training center in the Duluth area following a tour of the facility. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe refused to do what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing right here in this program \u00e2\u0080\u0094 social distance, wear masks, sanitize. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re protecting your apprentices. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not protecting America.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Biden said the people that he grew up with \u00e2\u0080\u009cdon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have money in stocks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and he said he measures the health of the U.S. economy by how places like Duluth and Scranton, Pa., are faring. He added that his \u00e2\u0080\u009cBuild Back Better plan \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in fact, my entire campaign \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is built upon a simple concept. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to reward hard work in America, not wealth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Related:Kamala Harris blasts Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coronavirus response, say he's \u00e2\u0080\u0098fixated on the stock market\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Meanwhile, Trump is due to make remarks at 7 p.m. Eastern Time at a \u00e2\u0080\u009cGreat American Comeback\u00e2\u0080\u009d event in Bemidji, a small city known in part for its statues of Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox.
