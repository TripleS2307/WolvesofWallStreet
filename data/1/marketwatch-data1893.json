Ayanna Pressley, ripping U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Sunday over the Trump administration's aggressive push to restart in-person schooling this fall. DeVos appeared on CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday morning calling for schools to reopen, despite surging coronavirus cases around the nation. \"There's going to be the exception to the rule, but the rule should be that kids go back to school this fall,\" DeVos told CNN. \"And where there are little flare-ups or hot spots, that can be dealt with on a school-by-school or a case-by-case basis.\" CNN host Dana Bash pressed DeVos to clarify the federal government's plan to reopen schools safely, and what it plans to do if there are outbreaks at schools. DeVos dodged the question, saying \"every school should have plans for that situation,\" while avoiding saying what, if anything, the government recommends those plans to be. To another Bash question - \"Can you assure students, teachers, parents that they will not get coronavirus because they're going back to school?\" - DeVos replied, \"Well, the key is that kids need to be back to school.\" Bash observed that it sounded as if the Trump Education Department were compelling schools to reopen and students to attend regardless of the public health situation in August and September. DeVos's response: \"No, what we're saying is that kids need to be back in school.\" In a tweet shortly after the interview aired, Pressley, a Massachusetts Democrat, tore into DeVos. \"[Y]ou have no plan,\" Pressley said, referring to DeVos. \"Teachers, kids and parents are fearing for their lives. You point to a private sector that has put profits over people and claimed the lives of thousands of essential workers. I wouldn't trust you to care for a house plant let alone my child.\" Last week, Sen. Kamala Harris and Rep. Katie Porter, both California Democrats, sent a letter to DeVos and the heads of the CDC and Health and Human Services Department saying they were \"deeply disappointed\" by the lack of federal reopening guidelines for school districts. \"You have wasted months, without apparently joining forces to conduct science-based research on the best ways to re-open schools or continue educating students,\" they said, calling for specific plans for the upcoming school year. On Sunday, a number of public health officials urged a cautious approach to reopening schools, saying decisions to open should be based on health data, not politics. While some argue that children appear to be less at risk of catching and spreading COVID-19, Israel recently saw a nationwide spike in cases after reopening its schools."}]}
