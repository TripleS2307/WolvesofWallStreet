Col. Alexander Vindman, a national-security aide who played a central role in President Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment case, announced his retirement from the Army on Wednesday with a scathing statement that accused the president of running a \u201ccampaign of bullying, intimidation, and retaliation.\u201d The statement from attorney David Pressman said Vindman was leaving the Army after more than 21 years after it had been made clear \u201cthat his future within the institution he has dutifully served will forever be limited.\u201d \u201cThrough a campaign of bullying, intimidation, and retaliation, the President of the United States attempted to force LTC Vindman to choose: Between adhering to the law or pleasing a President. Between honoring his oath or protecting his career. Between protecting his promotion or the promotion of his fellow soldiers,\u201d read the statement, first obtained by CNN. Vindman\u2019s name was on a promotion list sent to Defense Secretary Mark Esper earlier this year, according to one U.S. official familiar with the matter. But that list was delayed for weeks because the White House asked for an investigation of Vindman. The Pentagon did a review and found that any suggestion of misconduct was unfounded. The Margin:Vindman lawyer accuses Trump of \u2018bullying, intimidation, and retaliation\u2019 as lieutenant colonel announces Army retirement The official said the list was resent to Esper about a month ago, but again was delayed. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Another official said Esper signed the promotion list this week, with Vindman\u2019s name included. That list was expected to be sent to the White House by the end of the week, according to the defense official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an internal personnel matter. It\u2019s not clear whether Esper already knew of Vindman\u2019s plan to retire before he signed the list. The U.S. official said there was talk more than a week ago that he was planning to put in his retirement papers. Pressman said Vindman \u201cdid what the law compelled him to do; and for that he was bullied by the President and his proxies.\u201d \u201cLTC Vindman\u2019s patriotism,\u201d he said, \u201chas cost him his career. Today our country loses a devoted soldier, but it is incumbent upon all of us to ensure it does not lose the values he represents.\u201d The White House and the Pentagon did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Trump in February ousted Vindman from his job on the National Security Council, where he served as an expert on Ukraine, just two days after the president\u2019s acquittal by the Senate. Vindman\u2019s lawyer said then that his client had been told to leave in retaliation for \u201ctelling the truth.\u201d Vindman\u2019s twin brother, Lt. Col. Yevgeny Vindman, was also asked to leave his job as a White House lawyer. Both men were reassigned to the Army. Vindman had testified that he didn\u2019t think it was \u201cproper\u201d for Trump to \u201cdemand that a foreign government investigate\u201d former Vice President Joe Biden and his son\u2019s work for the energy company Burisma in Ukraine. And he told impeachment investigators that he twice raised concerns over the administration\u2019s push to have Ukraine investigate the Bidens. In the aftermath, senior Pentagon leaders insisted that Vindman would not see any retaliation as a result of the testimony. Talking to reporters in November, Esper said the department has protections for whistleblowers. Vindman \u201cshouldn\u2019t have any fear of retaliation. That\u2019s DOD\u2019s position,\u201d Esper said, adding that he flatly rejected suggestions that the soldier\u2019s career was over. He said he had spoken with Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy about the matter. McCarthy said in February that Vindman was not under investigation, and that he was serving in a Army headquarters job and would go on to senior service college in the summer. In gripping testimony, Vindman also spoke of his family\u2019s story and his father bringing them to the U.S. from the Soviet Union when he was a young child. \u201cDad, my sitting here today in the U.S. Capitol, talking to our elected officials, is proof that you made the right decision 40 years ago to leave the Soviet Union and come here to United States of America in search of a better life for our family,\u201d he testified. \u201cDo not worry, I will be fine for telling the truth.\u201d The lieutenant colonel, who served in Iraq and later as a diplomat, wore his uniform full of medals, including a Purple Heart. When a soldier requests retirement, it must be approved by the Army\u2019s Human Resources Command, and normally can take months to process before the person actually leaves the military.
