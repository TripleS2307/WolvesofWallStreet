Speaking at the Gerald Ford Presidential Museum in Grand Rapids, Mich., Barr said that \u00e2\u0080\u009cover the years, corporations such as Google GOOG, +1.97% GOOGL, +1.82%, Microsoft MSFT, +2.48%, Yahoo and Apple AAPL, +1.74% \u00c2 have shown themselves all too willing to collaborate with the CCP.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He listed as an example Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s removal of the Quartz news app from its app store in China, following a Chinese government complaint. The criticism of U.S. companies came amid a broad speech on China, in which Barr said the Chinese Communist Party was seeking to \u00e2\u0080\u009cmake the world safe for dictatorship\u00e2\u0080\u009d and accused China of waging an \u00e2\u0080\u009ceconomic blitzkrieg\u00e2\u0080\u009d against the U.S. in a bid for global dominance. As the U.S. presidential election nears, China appears to be increasingly in U.S. crosshairs. Last week, FBI Director Chris Wray said China was trying to \u00e2\u0080\u009ccompromise\u00e2\u0080\u009d American companies and institutions doing COVID-19 research. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has said he has no plans to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping, whom he had previously described as a friend."}]}
