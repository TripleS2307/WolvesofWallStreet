The government agency said U.S. soybean production is forecast at 4.3 billion bushels, down 45 million from the previous forecast due to lower harvested area. Soybean supplies are forecast at 4.8 billion bushels, down 96 million. November soybeans SX20, +1.47% traded at $10.71 3/4 a bushel, up 21 3/4, or 2.1%. A settlement around that level would be the highest for a most-active contract since March 2018, according to FactSet data."}]}
