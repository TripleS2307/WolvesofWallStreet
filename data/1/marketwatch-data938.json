We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working hard to get me back. I have to get all the way back because we still have to make America great again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said on the video released via Twitter TWTR, -0.23%. Trump, 74, was moved from the White House to Walter Reed medical center late Friday, the same day that he and first lady Melania Trump had tested positive for coronavirus. His medical regimen highlighted how the president is in a high-risk group for more serious illness from COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, observers say. He was given a dose of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s REGN, +0.36% \u00c2 experimental neutralizing antibody cocktail, in addition to Gilead Sciences Inc.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s GILD, +0.82% \u00c2 remdesivir. The president also received supplemental oxygen at least once, and dexamethasone, Dr. Sean Conley, Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s physician, said Sunday. Six months into the pandemic, there are precious few treatments available for patients with COVID-19, and if a vaccine becomes available, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unlikely to be readily ready until 2021. During a news conference on Sunday, Conley confirmed for the first time that the president had received oxygen support, at least once. There have been conflicting reports about the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health. White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told reporters outside Walter Reed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still not on a clear path yet to a full recovery,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and said the president went through a \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery concerning\u00e2\u0080\u009d period on Friday evening prior to his removal to Walter Reed. On Saturday, the Navy Commander Dr. Sean Conley, the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doctor, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt this time, the team and I are extremely happy with the progress the president has made.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Also Saturday, Dr. Sean Dooley, another doctor at Walter Reed, said Trump was no longer on oxygen, and said his cardiac function, liver function and kidney function were all normal. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in exceptionally good spirits.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dooley said the president told him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI feel like I could walk out of here today.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s address: iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } The number of confirmed U.S. coronavirus infections also include first lady Melania, and at least nine others in their circle, including close aide Hope Hicks, with more people expected to test positive from a White House Rose Garden event last weekend announcing the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett as a Supreme Court Justice. That ceremony was attended by more than 200 people with people sitting outside less than six feet apart, and many without masks. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe positive diagnosis puts the President and many of the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leaders at risk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009c Already, additional White House staffers and visitors to the White House, have tested positive. What action is taken now and over the next week will determine whether more cases can be avoided or if this will lead to a broader outbreak.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Sean Conley, physician to President Donald Trump, briefs reporters at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., Oct. 3.

Here is a full transcript of the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s address from Walter Reed: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want to begin by thanking all of the incredible medical professionals, the doctors, the nurses, everybody at Walter Reed Medical Center \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the finest in the world \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for the incredible job they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been doing. I came here. I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feeling so well. I feel much better now. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working hard to get me back. I have to get all the way back because we still have to make America great again. \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working hard to get me back. I have to get all the way back because we still have to make America great again.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done an awfully good job of that but we still have steps to go and I have to finish that job. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be back, I think, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be back soon and I look forward to finishing up the campaign the way it was started, the way we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been doing and the kind of numbers we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been doing. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been so proud of it. But this was something that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happened and it was something that happened to millions of people all over the world and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been fighting for them, not just in the U.S., I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m fighting for them all over the world. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to beat the coronavirus, or whatever you want to call it, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to beat it soundly. So many things are happening, if you look at the therapeutics, which I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m taking right now some of them, and others that are coming out soon that are looking like, frankly they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re miracles, if you want to know the truth. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re miracles. Related: Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s positive coronavirus test has shaken up the campaign \u00e2\u0080\u0094 plus what could happen next People criticize me when I say that but we have things happening that look like they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re miracles coming down from God, so I just want to tell you that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m starting to feel good. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know the next period of a few days. I guess that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the real test so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be seeing what happened over those next couple of days. I just want to be thankful for all the support I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on television, or reading about it. I most of all I appreciate what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been said by the American people, almost by a bipartisan consensus, by the American people. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a beautiful thing to see, and I very much appreciate it, and I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t forget it. I promise you that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0098I just didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to stay in the White House\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u009cI also want to thank the leaders of the world for their condolences, and they know what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going through. They know as your leader what I have to go through. But I had no choice because I just didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to stay in the White House. I was given that alternative: Stay in the White House, lock yourself in, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ever leave, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even go to the Oval Office, just stay upstairs and enjoy it. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see people, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talk to people, and just be done with it, and I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do that. \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be locked up in a room upstairs, totally safe and just say \u00e2\u0080\u0098Hey, whatever happens, happens\u00e2\u0080\u0099. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do that. We have to confront problems.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d I had to be out front and this is America, this is the United States. The greatest country in the world. This is the most powerful country in the world. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be locked up in a room upstairs, totally safe and just say \u00e2\u0080\u0098Hey, whatever happens, happens\u00e2\u0080\u0099. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do that. We have to confront problems. As a leader, you have to confront problems. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never been a great leader that would have done that. So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where it is. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m doing well. I want to thank everybody. Our first lady is doing very well. Melania asked me to say something as to the respect that she has for our country, the love that she has for our country, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re both doing well. Melania is really handling it very nicely. As you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve probably read, she is slightly younger than me, just a little tiny bit. And therefore, we know the disease, we know the situation with age versus younger people and Melania is handling it statistically like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supposed to be handled, and that makes me very happy and it makes the country very happy. But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m also doing well, and I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to have a very good result. Again, over the next few days we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to probably know for sure, so I just want to thank everybody out there, everybody, all over the world, specifically the United States. The outpouring of love has been incredible. I will never forget. Thank you very much.\u00e2\u0080\u009dCOVID-19 has now killed over 1 million people worldwide The Dow Jones Industrial Index DJIA, +0.56%, the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% \u00c2 and the Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39% all closed lower Friday in the wake of the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s diagnosis; the Nasdaq was down 2.2% at day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s end. Doubts about traction for further fiscal stimulus from Washington may be another factor discouraging investors who have been betting on Republicans and Democrats striking a deal to offer additional relief. As of Sunday, COVID-19 has now killed at least 1,034,865 people worldwide, and 209,749 in the U.S., according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. still has the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s highest number of COVID-19 cases (7,412,911), just ahead of India (6,549,373) and Brazil (4,906,833). Worldwide, there has been at least 35,011,322 confirmed cases, which mostly does not account for asymptomatic cases. Several companies in the U.S. and overseas are working on a vaccine. AstraZeneca AZN, +1.16% \u00c2 , in combination with Oxford University; BioNTech SE BNTX, +1.23% \u00c2 and partner Pfizer PFE, -0.27% ; GlaxoSmithKline GSK, +1.10% ; Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +1.39% ; Merck & Co. MERK, +1.59% ; Moderna MRNA, +0.09% ; and Sanofi SAN, -1.48% \u00c2 are among those working to get a vaccine through trials, in the hope one will be read in and/or by 2021."}]}
