Following the release of the results, the stock jumped 22% in after-hours trading, at times topping $400 a share. While Zoom has become popular for all types of videoconferences, it makes most of its money from large deals with corporate clients, as most individual users stick with the free option. The company revealed Monday that the number of corporate clients with more than 10 employees had grown by more than 400% in the past year, to more than 370,000, and that Zoom added more than 200 clients who spent more than $100,000 in the past year signed on in the second quarter, for a total of 988 \u201cupmarket\u201d customers. In a conference call Monday afternoon, Yuan revealed that Zoom signed two large corporate customers in recent months, Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, -1.47% and Activision Blizzard Inc. ATVI, +0.52% , and expanded within cloud-software giant ServiceNow Inc. NOW, +2.43% , which is now using Zoom\u2019s cloud-phone offering as well. \u201cFor the quarter, the year-over-year growth in revenue was primarily due to subscriptions provided to new customers, which accounted for approximately 81% of the increase, while subscriptions provided to existing customers accounted for approximately 19% of the increase,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Kelly Steckelberg said on the conference call. \u201cThis demand was broad-based across industry verticals, geographies and customer cohorts.\u201d Landing those large customers gives Zoom and its investors confidence that the end of the COVID-19 pandemic would not be the end of the boom times for Zoom. The company said Monday that it had $1.42 billion in future revenue under contract, a total that has more than tripled since the same time last year."}]}
