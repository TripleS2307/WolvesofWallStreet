How to buy a salvage-title vehicle", "body": "This article is reprinted by permission from NerdWallet. The deals you might encounter on salvage-title vehicles these days are enticing \u2014 late-model SUVs and luxury sedans, often with low miles, advertised for thousands less than comparable clean-history vehicles. The vehicles are clearly marked as having a \u201cbranded\u201d title, a designation that has traditionally frightened off most shoppers, perhaps spooked by past ventures into the depths of Craigslist, where sellers spin tales of tiny little fender-benders that, somehow, led insurance companies to write off a late-model car. They often turn up when you search online car-shopping sites and sort prices from low to high. That\u2019s because companies such as AutoSource, which has grown to 10 car lots in six states, Autolocity and dozens of local operators aggressively market branded-title cars as less expensive alternatives, complete with no-haggle pricing, financing and a limited warranty. Some will even arrange shipping across the country. But is a salvage-title car any better a choice under the bright lights of a dealer lot?What\u2019s a salvage title? The decision to \u201ctotal\u201d the vehicle (declare it a total loss) is made by the insurance company when it determines it isn\u2019t worth fixing. State laws vary but, in general, vehicles that have been damaged by an accident, flood, hailstorm or fire, are \u201cbranded\u201d with a salvage title to warn future buyers that there was a significant problem.

Jeff Huang, sales supervisor at Westlake Financial Services, a national auto financing company based in Los Angeles, agrees. \u201cThe question is, what kind of components did the shop repair the car with?\u201d he asks. Still, he adds, \u201cif you know the history of the car, there can be value there.\u201d There are a lot of reasons to proceed with caution: It\u2019s difficult to verify that the vehicle has been properly fixed. Other problems may slowly appear, such as fading paint, rust, uneven tire wear, or poor driving dynamics, Holthoff says. Pricing guides don\u2019t provide prices for vehicles with salvage titles, so it\u2019s hard to know what you should pay. When it\u2019s time to sell, most buyers will avoid branded titles. Salvage-title cars typically don\u2019t keep their factory warranty if any remains. You may be able to buy a warranty of some kind, but it will be limited. Not all insurance companies cover salvage-title cars. Many lenders won\u2019t finance branded-title vehicles (Westlake Financial is one of the few that does). Should you consider a branded-title vehicle? A salvage-title car might be a good fit for someone who understands the risks. Resale value is uncertain at best, but that\u2019s not an issue if you plan to drive the car for years. Financing won\u2019t be a problem if you can pay cash or your credit is good enough to make a personal loan viable. The quality of repairs won\u2019t always be obvious, but you\u2019re willing to have the car inspected and research the car\u2019s damage history. In return, you can expect potential savings between 20% and 40% under market value, according to Kelley Blue Book.

For example, if a car was stolen and had only a few parts stripped, it might get a salvage title, even though it could be restored to perfect running order. Hail damage can often be severe enough to total a car. \u201cMaybe some kid who wants a BMW BMW, -1.55% , but can\u2019t afford it,\u201d Huang says. \u201cBut he could buy one with a salvage title.\u201d For example, a salvage-titled 2019 Subaru Impreza Limited, with only 1,593 miles, was offered at $16,999. Without a salvage title, Kelley Blue Book estimates the car would cost $25,073 on a dealer\u2019s lot. Assuming this Subaru FUJHY, -1.41% was correctly repaired \u2014 a vehicle history report described the damage as \u201cmoderate to severe\u201d \u2014 a buyer would enjoy a nearly new car at a saving of $8,074.

You could wind up with an unreliable or even unsafe car that is hard to sell or trade.Homework is critical These rebuilt-title sellers make a living finding the right wrecked vehicles, repairing them and inspecting the result. But due diligence on your part is still essential: Get a vehicle history report from Carfax or AutoCheck. Avoid cars where the report shows it was towed from the scene or where the airbag was activated. These both indicate a more serious accident. Take any branded-title car you\u2019re considering to a reputable body shop or mechanic for an inspection. First, Google the car\u2019s vehicle identification number, or VIN, to bring up pictures of the car showing the damage before it was repaired. That will help an inspection focus on the right areas. Be sure to ask the shop to look for frame damage that could alter the alignment of the car. The test drive is crucial: Push every button and turn every knob. Take the car on the freeway to make sure it tracks straight. Find an empty road and hit the brakes hard. Get a quote for insurance coverage before you agree to buy the car. Read Yelp YELP, -1.66% or other reviews for the dealer. More from NerdWallet: If Your College Closes for Good, What Happens to Your Debt?
