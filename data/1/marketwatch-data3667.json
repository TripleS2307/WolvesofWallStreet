Dr. Deborah Birx, lead coordinator of the White House task force set up to oversee the pandemic response, said Kentucky and some other states should reimpose shutdowns of bars and limit indoor gatherings. \u201cWe do believe that there are states that do need to close their bars, to decrease indoor gatherings to less than 10 and to decrease social gatherings to less than 10 to really make it possible to control the pandemic before it gets worse,\u201d she told reporters at a news conference with Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear. Birx named Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee and Virginia as states that should reintroduce restrictions on movement and said health officials are worried about the total number of new cases and the percentage testing positive.
