The European Union's statistics agency said Friday that consumer prices in the currency area were 0.3% lower than in September 2019, a larger decline than the 0.2% fall recorded in August. Some of that drop is due to energy prices, which were 8.2% lower than a year earlier. But ECB policy makers are likely to be more concerned by the low level of core inflation, which excludes volatile items such as energy and food. The core inflation rate stood at just 0.2% in September, down from 0.4% in August. The central bank's aim is to keep inflation at around 2%. The ECB has responded to the coronavirus pandemic by greatly increasing its purchases of government bonds and offering cheap loans to banks. If sustained, the decline in consumer prices would make a further round of stimulus measures more likely."}]}
