The quarter\u2019s online sales rose 75% with \u201cstrong double-digit increases\u201d across geographies and made up about a third of total revenue for the quarter, Nike NKE, +0.97% said. Nike lost $790 million, or 51 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, contrasting with earnings of $989 million, or 62 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Sales fell to $6.3 billion from $10.1 billion a year ago. Nike pinned the 38% drop on store closures due to the coronavirus pandemic and fewer shipments to its wholesalers, which increased inventory.
