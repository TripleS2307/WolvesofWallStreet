The eurozone's fourth-biggest economy contracted 18.5% during the second quarter, after a 5.2% decline in the first quarter, the Spanish statistics agency INE said Friday in a first estimate for the period. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had forecast a 15.0% contraction. The Spanish economy contracted 22.1% on year in the second quarter, INE said. This is worse than the 18.5% contraction forecast by economists polled by the Journal. The Spanish release follows the publication of the first estimate of gross domestic product in France, which posted a historic contraction of 13.8% during the second quarter. Italy will also publish its GDP figures Friday and they are estimated to have suffered a similar decline, as Spain and Italy are the two worst-hit countries by the pandemic. The eurozone as a whole will also release the first estimate of its GDP in 2Q and a sharp contraction is expected. Write to Maria Martinez at maria.martinez@wsj.com"}]}
