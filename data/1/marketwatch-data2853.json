Berman stepped down as the top Manhattan prosecutor over the weekend following an assurance that his investigations into allies of President Donald Trump wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be disturbed. Clayton has emerged as the White House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pick for the post, though one roadblock is that New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s two U.S. senators have called for him to withdraw from consideration. Clayton has told the SEC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s staff that he plans to remain at the agency until he is confirmed as the U.S. attorney by the Senate. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot only is Clayton a short-timer, but he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a short-timer in the middle of a controversy. That can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be comforting to the staff, which is already suffering from two recent body-blow court defeats at the hands of the exchanges,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Katz said. A ruling last week struck down a planned transaction fee pilot, and a June 5 decision overruled the SEC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s challenge of data fee increases by Nasdaq Inc. NDAQ, +0.36% \u00c2 and the New York Stock Exchange, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc. ICE, -0.04% \u00c2 The analyst also noted that the SEC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leadership already had started to look like a lame duck earlier this month, with Clayton not expected to stay at the agency even if Trump is re-elected in November."}]}
