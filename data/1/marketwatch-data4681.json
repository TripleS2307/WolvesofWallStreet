These are the growing tensions between China and the U.S. and the risk of the U.K. not securing a trade deal with the EU,\u201d AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said. \u201cFor the time being, investors seem to move in whenever there is a drop-off in stock markets,\u201d he added.

German consumer confidence rose sharply heading into August, according to data from market research group GfK, which said it was driven by a temporary cut to value-added tax and a government stimulus package.

The Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream and Dove soap maker made a net profit of \u20ac3.28 billion, up from \u20ac3.01 billion the previous year, despite the challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic.

Daimler DAI, -1.31% stock climbed 4.3% despite widening losses, as the Mercedes-Benz owner reported seeing the \u201cfirst signs of a sales recovery\u201d from the pandemic.
