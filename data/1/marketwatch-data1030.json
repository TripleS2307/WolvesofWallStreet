Amid a surge in new cases globally, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced new restrictions aimed at curbing the virus\u2019s spread, after the U.K.\u2019s chief medical officers raised the nation\u2019s COVID-19 alert level to four from three, as the Associated Press reported. The restrictions include closing pubs, bars and other venues by 10 p.m., and imposing stiff fines to those who disobey quarantine rules. The U.K. isn\u2019t the only European country seeing a spike in cases, as official figures from Russia on Tuesday showed new cases increase by 6,215 in 24 hours, a 20% increase since the start of the month, according to the New York Times. Meanwhile, daily cases in Spain and France rose to more than 13,000. That pales in comparison with the U.S., however, which saw 54,874 new cases on Monday, and at least 428 deaths. The new case tally is 31% above the average of 41,812 cases a day over the past week, which was a 7% increase from the average two weeks earlier, New York Times data show.

Globally, cases grew to 31,424,898 and deaths rose to 966,776. New York Times President Trump contradicted facts and himself, by saying in a rally in Ohio that the coronavirus affects \u201cvirtually nobody,\u201d and really only affects elderly people, and elderly people with other health problems. He said in some states, where there have been thousands affected by the coronavirus, it affected \u201cnobody young.\u201d According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, 587,948 total children have tested positive for COVID-19 as of Sept. 17, representing 10.3% of total cases at the time. In the two weeks to Sept. 17, there were 74,553 new child cases reported, a 15% increase over the previous two-week period. And in states reporting, children represented 0.5% to 3.7% of total reported hospitalizations, and children represented 0.0% to 0.33% of all COVID-19 deaths. And in an interview with journalist Bob Woodward released earlier this month, Trump acknowledged that the virus didn\u2019t just affect old people, that there were \u201cplenty of young people\u201d affected. He responded to a backlash over his playing down of the virus by saying he didn\u2019t want to create a panic. Don\u2019t miss: Trump knew the coronavirus was \u2018deadly stuff\u2019 but wanted to \u2018play it down,\u2019 according to Woodward book. Trump had also reportedly said in March that if his administration can keep the COVID-19 death toll to 100,000, it will have done a \u201cvery good job.\u201d The stock market was headed for a higher close, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% rising 87 points, or 0.3%, in afternoon trading, to put it on course for the first gain in four session, while the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% gained 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39% climbed 1.2% and were set to snap four-day losing streaks.

DGX, +0.33% . Quest has received authorization from the Food and Drug Administration during the pandemic for five COVID-19 diagnostic tests. The project will test delivering COVID-19 test collection kits to single-family homes in North Las Vegas and Cheektowaga, New York, located within a mile of a Walmart supercenter next month, according to Tom Ward, Walmart\u2019s SVP of customer product, who wrote a blog post on Tuesday. The people who receive a test kit by drone delivery perform the nasal swab at home and mail it back to Quest. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot we can learn from our drone delivery pilots to help determine what roles drones can play in pandemic response, health care delivery, and retail,\u201d he wrote. \u2022 Sanofi SNY, +0.89% SAN, +1.20% and GlaxoSmithKline GSK, +1.10% GSK, +1.52% announced Tuesday that the companies have signed agreements with Canada to supply up to 72 million doses of their COVID-19 vaccine, starting in 2021. The companies had initiated a Phase 1/2 study on their vaccine candidate on Sept. 3, and expect first results in early December to support the initiation of a Phase 3 study before the end of the year. The companies said if the data is sufficient, they plan to request regulatory approval in the first half of 2021. \u201cTo address a global health crisis of this magnitude, it takes partnerships and we are grateful to Canada for its collaboration, and to [GlaxoSmithKline] for partnering with us to develop a safe and effective vaccine,\u201d said Thomas Triomphe, global head of Sanofi Pasteur.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices was originally expected to vote on Tuesday, the WSJ report said. Prior discussions at ACIP meetings indicated that a prioritization plan is likely to reserve initial doses for front-line health-care workers, as well as place a high priority on workers in essential industries and people at greatest risk for death. \u2022 Olivia Troye, an advisor to Vice President Mike Pence who spent eight months on the Trumps administration\u2019s coronavirus task force, said on \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d that President Trump was really focused on public image and his personal agenda, rather than the task force\u2019s agenda. Troye said Trump suggested that COVID could be a good thing, because it means he wouldn\u2019t have to shake hands, which he said was gross. Troye left the White House in July, she said so she could tell the truth about what was happening. Trump responded by saying Troye was a disgruntled employee, but he had no idea who she was. \u2022 In a virtual speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, President Trump blamed China for the coronavirus pandemic and said the U.N. must hold that country accountable.
