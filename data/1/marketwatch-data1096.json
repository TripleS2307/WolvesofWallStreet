The comments from the president come after presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden on Thursday called for a national mask mandate to limit the spread of COVID-19, stepping up his rhetoric on the issue after criticizing Trump's own stance earlier this summer and having called on the president as early as January, in a USA Today op-ed, to take the coronavirus more seriously than he was doing. Biden, speaking during a brief appearance before reporters in Wilmington, Del., said that \"every single American should be wearing a mask when they're outside for the next three months at a minimum.\" Trump blasted Biden for what he described as politicizing the viral outbreak to score \"political points,\" though he used much of the coronavirus press briefing in an attempt to highlight differences between the former vice president and himself as the race for the White House heats up with Biden's selection this week of Sen. Kamala Harris of California as his running mate. \"Stop playing politics with the virus,\" Trump said at one point. The president also emphasized his optimism about the prospects for a vaccine and remedies for the deadly illness. Opinion:Here's a pandemic stock tip: Buy on the rumor of a COVID-19 vaccine, sell on the news The global tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 climbed to 20.6 million on Thursday, with the death toll rising to 749,656, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. At least 12.8 million people are confirmed to have recovered. The U.S. has had 5.19 million cases, and COVID-19-related deaths stand at 166,027. Meanwhile, Trump attempted to tamp down a public outcry to comments he'd made about not funding the U.S. Postal Service and criticism of mail-in voting during a Fox Business Network interview, when he was asked about issues preventing a deal with Democratic lawmakers on another coronavirus relief package, Read:Trump explicitly links mail-in voting and his opposition to post-office financial relief The president said he would rather not provide funding to the USPS and encouraged voters to physically travel to voting stations even if the virus was still not under control on Election Day on Nov. 3. From the archives (December 2019):Trump campaign adviser tells Wisconsin Republicans in secret recording that voting-place tactics will be stepped up \"We want to have an accurate vote,\" he said, suggesting that voting by mail is vulnerable to fraud. \"I am not saying anything wrong with voting, I want them to vote, but that would mean they would have to go to a voting booth like they used to and vote,\" he said. \"We want people to vote so when they vote it means one vote. It doesn't mean ballots all over the place,\" Trump continued. Trump currently trails in national opinion polls and has repeatedly attacked mail-in voting, claiming that expanding such voting would lead to large-scale fraud in the election. Independent researchers have found no widespread cases of such voter fraud in past races. A number of states have conducted elections primarily by mail, and others are rolling out mail-in balloting. He and the first lady have requested ballots to vote in Florida while in Washington, but he opts to characterize such votes as absentee rather than mail-in, though it's a distinction without difference. Key Words (April 2020):White House officials may or may not have explicitly threatened a veto but made clear Trump's opposition to post-office rescue funds in the CARES Act He also claimed that countries like China, Iran and Russia could create counterfeit ballots.

She is the first Black woman and the first person of Indian ancestry on a major national ticket. \"I just heard today that she doesn't meet the requirements, and by the way, the lawyer who wrote that pieces is a very highly qualified, very talented lawyer. I have no idea if that's right,\" he said. \"I would have assumed the Democrats would have checked that out before she gets chosen to run for vice president,\" he said in a response to reporter's question. The questions abut Harris follow an op-ed in Newsweek by John C. Eastman, a law professor at Chapman University, who argued that because neither of Harris's parents were naturalized U.S. citizens at the time of Harris's birth in 1964, she is not a \"natural born citizen\" and therefore \"ineligible for the office of the president and, hence, ineligible for the office of the vice president.\" A claim that has been refuted by experts, including in the pages of Newsweek.
