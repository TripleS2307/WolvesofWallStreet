DGX, +0.33% were down 0.4% in premarket trading on Thursday after the company said it will sell a COVID-19 diagnostic test directly to consumers to use at home. The test, which requires nasal swab collection, previously received an emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration. When a consumer orders the test online, a physician reviews the order before agreeing to send it out. Consumers can either perform the test at home and mail it back to Quest, or take the kit to a Walmart Inc. WMT, +1.00% drive-through pharmacy, perform the test, and then drop it off there. Quest's stock is up 7.2% so far this year, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% has gained 4.8%."}]}
