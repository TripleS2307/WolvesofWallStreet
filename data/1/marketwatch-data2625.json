OPEC+ in August relaxed earlier output curbs to 7.7 million barrels per day in August, from a record 9.7 million barrels. \u201cIf these additional cuts are implemented, the feared production surplus on the oil market could be avoided and stocks reduced considerably,\u201d said Eugen Weinberg, analyst at Commerzbank, in a note. During the meeting, Saudi Arabia\u2019s energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman stressed the need for all countries to stick to their production ceilings. Abdulaziz also had a warning for traders betting on a fall in crude prices. \u201cMake my day,\u201d he said in a news conference, according to news reports. West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery CL.1, -1.62% US:CLV20 tacked on 14 cents, or 0.3%, to settle at $41.11 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. However, November Brent crude BRN.1, -0.07% BRN00, -0.07%, the global benchmark, lost 15 cents, or nearly 0.4% at $43.15 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe. For the week, WTI was up 10.1%, which marked the largest weekly rise for a front-month contract since the week ended June 5, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Brent added 8.3%, the strongest such rise since the week ended June 19. Prices for the U.S. benchmark ended below the session\u2019s highs and spent some time during Friday\u2019s session moving lower after Aljazeera reported that Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar announced a conditional lifting of a months-long blockage of oilfields and ports by the Libyan National Army. That fed expectations for higher global crude supplies. News reports on Monday had said that Haftar planned to halt the blockade. Energy traders will wait to see if Haftar\u2019s confirmation to lift block on oil exports will be accepted by the country\u2019s national oil company, said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. \u201cIt seems unlikely that Libya will quickly be back to producing 1.1 million barrels per day. Meanwhile, Analysts noted that current oil-price levels are putting a strain on public finances for a number of major producers. \u201cIf prices move markedly lower, we think the sovereign producers would step in to safeguard their domestic finances. Current prices remain well below the fiscal break-even levels of the vast majority of OPEC+ producers and another extended stay in the $30s/barrel could imperil the political stability of several key petrostates,\u201d said Helima Croft, head of global commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, in a note. She expects OPEC+, at a minimum, to put a hold on plans to reduce the cut to 5.8 million barrels a day, which would effectively put an additional 2 million barrels a day on the market, when the entire group meets again in December. \u201cIt will be worth watching whether the additional Saudi export volumes (which will be coming as domestic demand eases) put too much strain on the market and trigger an early adjustment, especially if the compliance challenged countries fail to make headway on compensatory cuts,\u201d she said. In a note dated Thursday, analysts at Goldman Sachs said oil prices are rebounding, after having erased all of their summer gains in the first week of September, in part due to a slowdown in Chinese imports.

Back on Nymex, petroleum products saw mixed trading, with October gasoline up 1% at $1.2366 a gallon and October heating oil down nearly 0.1% at $1.159 a gallon. Gasoline futures marked a weekly rise of 12,9%, but heating oil was up by a more modest 6.4%. Natural-gas futures, meanwhile, ended with a modest gain Friday, after a 9.9% loss Thursday when U.S. government data revealed a larger than expected weekly rise in domestic supplies of the fuel. October natural gas US:NGV20 added 0.3% at $2.048 per million British thermal units. For the week, prices were down 9.7%. On Thursday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released an update to their three-month temperature outlook, \u201cwhich now predicts above-normal temperatures for the months of October, November, and December,\u201d said Christin Redmond, commodity analyst at Schneider Electric, in a daily note. \u201cIt is the first indication of a possible mild winter, which would be bearish for natural gas prices.\u201d Also see:Why soybeans may be headed for their highest price in 6 years"}]}
