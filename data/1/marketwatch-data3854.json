Trading has been volatile, however, and futures prices look to end the week down nearly 22%, for their biggest weekly loss since March 1994, according to FactSet data. The rice market has seen a couple of years of tighter stocks \u201cwith Mother Nature delaying or outright stopping planting,\u201d said Ted Nelson, risk management consultant for INTL FCStone, with heavy rains affecting the 2019-20 crop throughout the U.S. Delta region, which includes the top rice-producing state of Arkansas. So far in 2020, most-active rough rice futures have climbed 21%, with the July contract US:RRN20 settled at $16.065 per hundredweight on Friday. Most-active rice futures settled at $22.065 on June 4, the highest finish since April 25, 2008. Carryout stocks for the 2019-20 crop year, which is defined as the amount of supply minus demand, has dropped throughout the year on the back of early export demand, said Nelson. Then came an \u201cunexpected spike in domestic use and export interest\u201d as the COVID-19 pandemic brought \u201cfood security\u201d to the fore. The tighter stocks and higher demand situation \u201cpushed an already illiquid futures market into levels we have not seen since 2008,\u201d said Nelson. \u201cCurrently, there is a very tight, almost nonexistent supply in the U.S. interior markets,\u201d said Nelson, adding that domestic mills and rice buyers are trying to ration demand, with new crop rice only a couple of months away from harvest. Shawn Hackett, president of Hackett Financial Advisors Inc., however, doesn\u2019t see a shortage. Instead, it\u2019s \u201caccess\u201d to rice that may be a problem because of COVID-19 hoarding. There \u201ccould be regional shortages stemming from logistical problems,\u201d he said. If those pandemic fears subside, and the U.S. ends up with a large crop, that may cause prices to collapse, said Hackett. Upcoming supplies in the U.S., however, are expected to rise. They should be \u201cmuch more plentiful\u201d for the 2020-21 crop year, Nelson said. Total acres planted in the U.S. are forecast to rise to 2.85 million acres this year, from 2.54 million acres in 2019, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture report released in late March. The USDA also forecasts the 2020-21 U.S. rice crop at 216.2 million hundredweight (cwt), up 17% from a year earlier, according to a report released in May. Nelson expects rice prices to weaken as harvest starts in Louisiana and the southern Delta and \u201cworks its way north starting in the coming weeks.\u201d Globally, however, supply and demand may remain tight. The International Grains Council estimates global rice demand of 500 million metric tons for the 2020-21 crop year, with production at an estimated 506 million metric tons. So globally, \u201cthis year\u2019s weather in key growing areas will be watched closely and any adverse weather could result in reduced global production,\u201d said Blake Robben, senior market strategist at Archer Financial Services. On a short-term basis, Robben expects rice prices to remain within a $16 to $13 range, \u201cunless the market undergoes another supply shock.\u201d"}]}
