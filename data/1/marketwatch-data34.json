But after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin talked by phone, the provisions of the plan for coronavirus testing remained a sticking point. In a tweet, Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill said the pair talked for about half an hour and Mnuchin \u201creturned to the table with a proposal that attempted to address some of the concerns Democrats have.\u201d He said there was no agreement yet on a \u201cstrategic plan\u201d to combat coronavirus. \u201cFor this and other provisions, we are still awaiting language from the Administration as negotiations on the overall funding amount continue,\u201d he tweeted. Prior to the Pelosi-Mnuchin discussion breaking up, Trump expressed his hope for a big deal while on a conservative radio talk show. \u201cI would like to see a bigger stimulus package, frankly, than either the Democrats or the Republicans are offering,\u201d Trump told host Rush Limbaugh on what the president\u2019s campaign has called a \u201cradio rally.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like to see money going to people. It was not their fault that China sent in the plague,\u201d Trump said, blaming Beijing again for the coronavirus pandemic. Pelosi pressed Mnuchin Thursday on whether Trump wanted a comprehensive deal or just a smaller one, after she publicly rejected a standalone bill for airline aid only. Trump appeared Friday to favor a large deal and tweeted \u201cGo Big!\u201d early in the day. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } The U.S. stock market continued to follow the talks\u2019 progress, but were only moderately up in late afternoon trading DJIA, +0.56%.

He has approved a revised package, he would like to do a deal,\u201d Kudlow said on Fox Business News. The situation marks a sharp turnaround from Tuesday afternoon, when Trump tweeted he was pulling out of talks and both Pelosi and the Republican party Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell appeared to accept the negotiations were over until after the election. But McConnell\u2019s path to getting a deal of more than $1 trillion passed in the Senate would appear difficult as he has said some of his Republican colleagues don\u2019t want to see more stimulus spending at all. At a campaign appearance in Kentucky, McConnell said his immediate focus was on getting U.S. Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett confirmed, as nailing down details of another fiscal stimulus bill, writing legislative language and other issues would mean a deal would take some time to reach the Senate, if one was reached. \u201cThe first priority for the Senate is the Supreme Court,\u201d McConnell said. Barrett\u2019s confirmation hearings are slated to start next week. And even if Trump and Democrats can agree on a dollar figure, there is no guarantee they can agree on policies in a package as well. \u201cThe devil and the angels are in the details. Part of it is about money and part of it is about policy. And so we\u2019ll continue our conversation today,\u201d Pelosi said in an interview on MSNBC."}]}
