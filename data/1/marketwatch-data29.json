Demetrius Freeman/Washington Post via AP Confirmation hearings on President Donald Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, are set to kick off Monday, in what promises to be an intense Washington spectacle just three weeks before Election Day. The hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee are scheduled to get underway at 9 a.m. Eastern time on Monday, in the first of a four-day process. Trump and Senate Republicans are plowing ahead with Barrett\u2019s nomination, over Democrats\u2019 objections. Democrats have said that whoever wins the Nov. 3 election should choose a replacement for the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, just as Republicans refused to take up President Barack Obama\u2019s nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to the seat vacated upon Antonin Scalia\u2019s death in February 2016, explaining that a presidential election was just nine months away.

Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican locked in a tight re-election fight with Democrat Jaime Harrison.
