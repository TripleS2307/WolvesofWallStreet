The 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.777% was up 0.6 basis point to 0.674%, while the 2-year note rate TMUBMUSD02Y, 0.156% was at 0.141%. The 30-year bond TMUBMUSD30Y, 1.576% rose 1.6 basis points to 1.414%. Bond prices move inversely to yields.What\u2019s driving Treasurys? Minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s July meeting showed the central bank\u2019s rate-setting group didn\u2019t see the benefit of implementing so-called yield-curve control, capping yield. The Fed\u2019s staff also told central bank officials in late July that they were lowering their estimate for economic growth over the second half of the year. The pushback against the yield-curve control gave a lift to longer-term bond yields on Wednesday as investors see the Fed\u2019s bond-buying as instrumental for anchoring rates. Still, yields have remained within a tight trading range between 0.90% and 0.50% since March. The uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic's path in the U.S. and the expectation for interest rates to remain near 0% for the foreseeable future have prevented a major bond-market selloff. In the afternoon, an auction of $25 billion of new government bonds that wasn\u2019t as well received as anticipated contributed to a bout of modest weakness in Treasurys, pushing yields higher. New debt supply can push prices for bonds lower, and yields higher.What did market participants\u2019 say? \u201cThe reality is that the described lack of urgency to deploy [yield-curve control] is better characterized as \u2018not-as-uber-dovish-as-hoped.\u2019 Indeed, it\u2019s hard to characterize any move by the Fed right now as not highly accommodative,\u201d said Jon Hill, an interest-rate strategist at BMO Capital Markets, in e-mailed comments."}]}
