The U.K. government has ditched the system it used to grade students whose examinations were canceled by the coronavirus pandemic. The closure of schools around the world meant countries had to find a way to assess students who couldn\u2019t sit the usual end-of-year exams. England\u2019s qualifications regulator Ofqual used an algorithm to combine teachers\u2019 predicted grades for high school leavers with the historic performance of schools. It aimed to ensure consistency between year groups and avoid overinflated grades, but it was met with criticism after 39.1% of English students\u2019 predicted grades were lowered, meaning many missed the grades they needed to secure places at university. Read: More than 1 in 5 college students won\u2019t be enrolling in college this fall On Monday, Ofqual and the education secretary Gavin Williamson apologized for upset caused by the approach, and said students would now be awarded teachers\u2019 predicted grades instead. Days earlier, Williamson had said there would be \u201cno change\u201d to the government\u2019s approach. \u201cWe now believe it is better to offer young people and parents certainty by moving to teacher-assessed grades,\u201d Williamson said on Monday. \u201cI am sorry for the distress this has caused young people and their parents but hope this announcement will now provide the certainty and reassurance they deserve,\u201d he added. The Scottish government had made a similar reversal a week earlier, after significant backlash against its own grading algorithm. Williamson has faced calls to resign over the issue but when asked if he would do so in an interview round on Tuesday morning he repeatedly avoided answering. The opposition Labour party\u2019s leader Sir Keir Starmer did not call on Williamson to resign but has described the affair as a \u201cscreeching U-turn.\u201d iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } \u201cIncompetence has become this Government\u2019s watchword,\u201d Starmer said.

The downside of keeping kids home is pretty severe, Goldman says Labour had urged the government to drop its approach and allow teacher-assigned grades to stand. \u201cThe injustice and chaos surrounding A-level and GCSE results must come to an end,\u201d said Kate Green, Labour\u2019s education spokesperson. \u201cThe Government must now allow young people to use the grades their teachers predicted,\u201d she said. But Williamson and Prime Minister Boris Johnson were also pushed by lawmakers from their own Conservative Party, who argued it was unfair for students to have grades lowered by a computer program, for exams they didn\u2019t take. \u201cI am pressing the government to take further action to remedy the situation for all those who have been affected,\u201d Conservative lawmaker Laurence Robertson said on Twitter TWTR, -0.23%. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Younger students in England will receive their GCSE exam results on Thursday and will breathe a sigh of relief, as the policy change applies to both A-levels and GCSEs. Opinion: School closures force many Americans to choose between their children\u2019s education and earning a paycheck Their results will now reflect teachers\u2019 predicted grades, not those based on the computer algorithm, which were expected to cause more upset than the A-level results. One student who was set to be the first from his school to attend the University of Cambridge had been predicted four A* (similar to A+) grades, but was rejected after the government\u2019s system awarded him one A* and three As. Mithushan Thiagarajah said on the BBC\u2019s \u201cNewsnight\u201d: \u201cI knew I could get those grades if I actually did the exams.\u201d He was one of many who missed out on conditional university offers they had expected to meet."}]}
