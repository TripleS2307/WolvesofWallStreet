GILD, +0.82% said Wednesday it started a clinical trial of using its drug remdesivir to treat COVID-19 in pediatric patients. \"While the novel coronavirus appears to disproportionally affect adults - especially the elderly and those with underlying health conditions - concerning reports have been documented of children and young adults being hospitalized with COVID-19 and related autoimmune symptoms,\" said Gilead Chief Medical Officer Merdad Parsey in a statement. The drug maker said it will begin enrolling about 50 pediatric patients for the study ranging from newborns to adolescents. On May 1, the Food and Drug Administration granted an emergency use authorization for remdesivir to treat COVID-19, and said this week that treatments recently touted by President Donald Trump could interfere with the drug's effectiveness."}]}
