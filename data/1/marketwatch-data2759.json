But that return to growth may be a toss-up when it come to the current quarter. Catz she expects adjusted fiscal first-quarter earnings of 84 cents to 88 cents a share on revenue with revenue either increasing or declining by 1%, meaning $9.13 billion to $9.31 billion. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect earnings of 85 cents a share on revenue of $9.05 billion.

In a statement, Catz said Oracle\u2019s \u201coverall business did remarkably well considering the pandemic, but our results would have been even better except for customers in the hardest-hit industries that we serve, such as hospitality, retail and transportation, postponing some of their purchases.\u201d Taking a different view was Jefferies analyst Brent Thill, who has a hold rating and a $55 price target on Oraclle. In a note following the earnings release, Thill said he viewed Oracle\u2019s revenue as \u201cunderwhelming in the seasonally strong\u201d fourth quarter. Thill said he was looking at Oracle\u2019s results \u201cagainst a backdrop of a highly supportive software spending environment as reflective of share losses\u201d to competitors like Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +2.48% and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +3.01% .
