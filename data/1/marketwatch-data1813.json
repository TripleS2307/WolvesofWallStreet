SHAK, +1.82% stands to gain most from Gov. Andrew Cuomo's announcement that indoor dining at 25% capacity will resume in New York City, according to a Truist Securities analysis of its restaurant coverage. Indoor dining will begin in the city on September 30. Truist says about 15% of Shake Shack's company-owned restaurants are in New York City, and those restaurants accounted for 20% to 25% of sales pre-COVID-19. Shake Shack had been under pressure previously due to its transition to a single delivery partner, Grubhub Inc. GRUB, +0.83%. Other restaurant chains that stand to gain are Popeyes, which is part of the Restaurant Brands International Inc. QSR, -0.60% portfolio and has about 4% of stores in the city, and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. CMG, +0.01%, which has about 3% of its restaurants in the five boroughs. Shake Shack stock is up 20% for the year to date while the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% is up almost 6% for the period."}]}
