Market participants also were wary of a potentially contested November result following Tuesday\u2019s rancorous first presidential debate. How did stock benchmarks perform?

Stocks closed higher, but off the session\u2019s best levels, as doubts grew about Washington\u2019s ability to provide the U.S. economy with another round of fiscal stimulus ahead of the November elections. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters Wednesday afternoon that Republicans and Democrats were still \u201cvery very far apart\u201d on how much to spend, according to Reuters News. The statement contradicted Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who, earlier in the day, said he was hopeful about a striking a deal, after a new $2.2 trillion House Democratic bill was unveiled late Monday. \u201cMitch McConnell said the opposite,\u201d said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital, in an interview, adding that his comments led early stock-market gains to wobble. \u201cI kind of think they will still get a deal done,\u201d he told MarketWatch. \u201cBecause at this point, it\u2019s politically motivated and it serves both parties going into the election.\u201d See: Coronavirus aid talks entering final stages as Pelosi, Mnuchin meet in Washington Developments on Capitol Hill overshadowed positive data on housing and jobs that had been a focus for much of the session. \u201cMost people gauge their net worth not on their stock portfolio, but on the value of their house,\u201d said Kent Engelke, chief economic strategist at Capitol Securities Management, in an interview. \u201cWe now have two parts of the economy starting to really show strength.\u201d Home-contract signings were at a record high in August, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday. Earlier Automatic Data Processing said 749,000 private-sector jobs had been created in September, ahead of estimates for a gain of 650,000, and the strongest reading in three months. Last month, the ADP data showed that 480,000 jobs were created in August. ADP\u2019s reading could bode well for Friday\u2019s more closely followed nonfarm-payrolls report from the U.S. Labor Department, with 800,000 jobs estimated for September and the unemployment rate slipping to 8.2% from 8.4%. Also, a reading of Chicago-area business activity in September was stronger than expected, with a reading of 62.4. U.S. GDP losses for the second quarter also were cut slightly to -31.4%, from -31.7% on an annualized basis. Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari on Wednesday said to expect only a \u201cgrinding\u201d economic recovery, without a dramatic change in policy or a vaccine breakthrough, while urging Congress to provide more fiscal stimulus. Diane Jaffee, senior portfolio manager at TCW, sees incremental progress in both the economy, particularly in hiring, and in the market, with some broadening of sector gains. \u201cI think Chairman Powell said it best: there are multiple phases for this, and we\u2019re in phase two, a recovery from the horrific lows, but the broad damage done to the leisure industry and restaurants and small businesses is going to take a long, long time,\u201d Jaffee told MarketWatch. \u201cThat\u2019s why the Fed is going to be patient.\u201d But Jaffee also thinks another round of fiscal support from Washington is critical. \u201cWhile some states have stepped into the void, there are still a lot of hurting people out of there and that should be done at a national level,\u201d she said. More positive data on potential coronavirus treatments also helped bolster investor sentiment with an experimental COVID-19 drug from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals REGN helping reduce virus levels and improve symptoms in sick patients who weren\u2019t hospitalized . The first presidential debate late Tuesday night, one of a three-part series, between President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger former Vice President Joe Biden did little to alter the trajectory of the race for the White House or to offer clear guidance for market participants on policy. See: Presidential debate antics leave many viewers disgusted \u201cIt was an acrimonious, chaotic and insulting debate,\u201d wrote Naeem Aslam, analyst at AvaTrade in a note, adding that there\u2019s a growing possibility of an uncertain outcome in the Nov. 3 contest, which could roil markets in the short term. Both candidates suggested that the presidency may not be decided on Election Day.Which stocks were in focus? Palantir Technologies Inc.
