What are major benchmarks doing? The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% fell 405.89 points, or 1.5%, to close at 27,534.58 but had been up by as many as 234 points. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% shed 59.77 points, or 1.8%, to finish at 3,339.19, after touching an intraday high at 3,425.55. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.39% fell 221.97 points, or 2%, closing around 10,919.59, after hitting an intraday high at 11,299.53. Stocks bounced Wednesday after a rout that pushed the Nasdaq into correction territory, falling more than 10% from a record close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 439.58 points, or 1.6%, to finish at 27,940.47, while the S&P 500 advanced 67.12 points, or 2%, to close at 3,398.96. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 293.87 points, or 2.7%, ending at 11,141.56.What\u2019s driving the market? All three U.S. benchmark stock indexes have fallen for four of the past five days with the Nasdaq Composite now down 7.27% so far for September. \u201cUntil there\u2019s a clear unambiguous, oversold underpinning, markets will remain volatile,\u201d Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial, told MarketWatch. Thursday\u2019s market selloff also comes amid doubts over the prospect of another fiscal stimulus package, a continuing source of volatility for Wall Street. Democrats blocked a Senate Republican bill on the Senate floor Thursday, raising the possibility that a stimulus bill would have to wait until after the November Presidential election. Traders digested a report on U.S. weekly jobless benefit claims, one of the key pieces of economic data amid the coronavirus pandemic, which came in weaker-than-expected, with initial jobless claims at 884,000, compared with the 850,000 expected by economists surveyed by Dow Jones. The total was unchanged from the previous week, the Labor Department said. Continuing claims from those filing for at least two weeks rose from the previous week, hitting 13.385 million, an increase of 93,000 from a week ago and an indicator that the strong jobs improvement through the summer may be tailing off entering the fall. Investors remain fixated on tech and other megacap tech stocks, including Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.74%, Facebook Inc. FB, +0.26%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +3.01% and Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +2.48%, which had led a surge that many investors felt had become euphoric before the Nasdaq\u2019s selloff. Analysts said the tech selloff, relative to the size of the rally from the March pandemic lows, marked less of a retreat than meets the eye. \u201cWhile a drop of this size from the peak sounds like a steep correction, it remains a minor one given the index had rallied 83% from the March lows in a mere five months,\u201d said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, referring to the Nasdaq-100 Index NDX, +1.51%. \u201cWith a price to earnings ratio of 36, valuations for the index are still significantly overstretched, hence we should expect more volatility in the weeks to come heading into the U.S. presidential election\u201d in November, he said, in a note. Investors also parsed moves by the European Central Bank, which left its policy unchanged at minus 0.5% and its refinancing rate at 0%, while reaffirming it plans to leave rates at present or lower levels until inflation rises to converge with its target at 2%. ECB President Christine Lagarde said the unwelcome strength of the euro was discussed by policy makers, but isn\u2019t something that the bank targets. \u201cThe ECB\u2019s admission that the euro\u2019s recent strength is not a significant worry will help propel the currency higher, likely prompting even more alarm behind the ECB\u2019s closed doors,\u201d wrote Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, in a note. \u201cHowever, even if Christine Lagarde\u2019s every word had been directed at containing the Euro\u2019s appreciation, that would have been hopelessly optimistic,\u201d the analyst wrote.

Short seller Hindenburg Research published a report on electric truck maker Nikola Inc. NKLA, -1.36% on Thursday, accusing it of being an \u201cintricate fraud\u201d built on lies told by its Founder and Executive Chairman Trevor Milton over many years.
