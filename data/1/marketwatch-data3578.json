Appearing on Fox News with Chris Wallace, President Trump said there was no campaign to discredit Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for three decades. Wallace asked Trump about a Facebook FB, +0.26%  post by Daniel Scavino, White House deputy chief of staff for communications, depicting Fauci as a faucet with the description: \"Sorry, Dr. Faucet! At least you know if I'm going to disagree with a colleague, such as yourself, it's done publicly - and not cowardly, behind journalists with leaks.\" Trump did not quite dismiss Scavino's criticisms. \u201c 'Well, I don't know that he's a leaker. He's a little bit of an alarmist. That's OK. A little bit of an alarmist.' \u201d - President Donald Trump on Anthony Fauci The president suggested that the doctor mishandled the crisis: \"Dr. Fauci at the beginning said, 'This will pass. Don't worry about it. This will pass.' He was wrong.\" Trump also said the doctor said, \" 'Don't ban China. Don't ban China.' I did. He then admitted that I was right.\" On April 13, when reporters questioned Fauci about possible tension between him and the White House, Fauci said he made recommendations to Trump to restrict travel. \"And the answer was yes,\" Fauci said. \"And then another time was, 'We should do it with Europe,' and the answer was yes. And the next time, 'We should do it with the U.K.,' and the answer was yes.\" Related:Fauci takes aim at Trump, state lawmakers and young Americans: 'You're propagating the pandemic' Fauci has taken a more defiant tone of late, telling InStyle magazine, \"With all due modesty, I think I'm pretty effective. I certainly am energetic. And I think everybody thinks I'm doing more than an outstanding job.\" He said he evolved with the situation: \"I don't regret anything I said then because in the context of the time in which I said it, it was correct.\" He said, \"We were told in our task-force meetings that we have a serious problem with the lack of PPEs and masks for the health providers who are putting themselves in harm's way every day to take care of sick people,\" adding, \"When it became clear that the infection could be spread by asymptomatic carriers ... we had to strongly recommend masks.\" \u201c Fauci has said that the U.S. government should promote social distancing and could do better with contact tracing. \u201d The doctor also said SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes the disease known as COVID-19, will continue to spread unless everyone steps up their game. Fauci said that many states have reopened too quickly, and, addressing people who don't advocate social distancing, he said, \"You're propagating the pandemic.\" As of Tuesday, COVID-19 had infected 14.7 million people globally. It had killed over 610,149 people worldwide. COVID-19 has claimed 140,909 lives in the U.S. At least 3.8 million people were infected with the virus. New York, the epicenter of the virus in the U.S., has still had the most deaths of any state (32,506), followed by New Jersey (15,715) and Massachusetts (8,433). Fauci has repeatedly said that the U.S. government should promote social distancing and could do better with contact tracing, the process of tracking people who have been in contact with someone who has the virus, and instructing them to stay home for 14 days. \"I don't think we're doing very well, for a number of reasons, and not all of which is the fault of the system.\" Related:Defiant Fauci tells InStyle magazine: 'With all due modesty, I think I'm pretty effective' The World Health Organization currently estimates that 16% of people with COVID-19 are asymptomatic and can transmit the coronavirus, while other data show that 40% of coronavirus transmission is due to carriers not displaying symptoms of the illness. As a result, public health officials have advised people to keep a distance of 6 feet from one another. A recent University of California, San Francisco, study found that there's a high load of SARS-CoV-2 shedding in the upper respiratory tract, even among pre-symptomatic patients, \"which distinguishes it from SARS-CoV-1, where replication occurs mainly in the lower respiratory tract.\" Such a viral load makes symptom-based detection of infection less effective in the case of SARS CoV-2, it said. The markets appear torn between optimism on vaccine research and the economic impact of new surges in southern and southwestern states.
