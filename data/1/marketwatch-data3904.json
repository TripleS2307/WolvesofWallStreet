Definitely not this. But that didn't stop Ryan Cohen - who sold Chewy CHWY, +4.96%  , the company he co-founded, for $3.35 billion back in 2017 - from throwing diversification out the window and plunking almost his entire payout into just two stocks: Apple AAPL, +1.74% and Wells Fargo WFC, , two major components of Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A, +0.06% portfolio. \"It's too hard to find, at least for me, what I consider great ideas,\" he told Bloomberg News, without specifying exactly how much he invested. \"When I find things I have a lot of conviction in, I go all-in.\" No real estate. No hedge funds. No private equity. No bonds. The same car and home he's had for years. The rest? \"All-in\" on Apple and Wells Fargo. Against all conventional wisdom. It hasn't exactly been a smooth ride, at last for the latter position. He told Bloomberg News that his average cost basis in Wells Fargo is about $46, having built up his position in the second quarter of 2017 when it was trading at $54. Now, the stock is trading below $32. On the flip side, Apple is doing just fine. It rallied 120% over the time frame and represents a much larger chunk of Cohen's portfolio. Combined, his two positions, according to Bloomberg calculations, have been flat for the past two years to lag the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87%  . Nevertheless, Cohen, who never went to college, is a fan of Buffett, whom he quotes often. He knows, however, that his highly-concentrated approach would raise plenty of eyebrows among the \"diversify!\" crowd. But \"I don't want to swing for a single,\" he said. Cohen recognizes most people shouldn't follow his lead. \"You need to have the temperament to block the noise,\" he told Bloomberg. \"Sometimes it feels like a roller coaster.\" Meanwhile, the stock market keeps charging higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% building on last week's strong finish with a premarket rally Sunday night."}]}
