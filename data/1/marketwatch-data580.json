Should I ask him to pay me a salary?", "body": "Dear Moneyist, My fianc\u00c3\u00a9 has a very successful landscaping company, which is about five years old. I\u00e2\u0080\u0098ve been in corporate banking for 15 years. My fianc\u00c3\u00a9 and I are discussing me quitting my cushy six-figure job and helping him with his business. My question is, can I ask him to pay me a salary? Right now, he pays all the bills and I put money into a joint savings account for us along with helping with groceries, cleaning lady, etc. Helping him at \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe shop\u00e2\u0080\u009c feels exciting and would be a nice change of pace/scenery. I just want to ensure I am/we are setting this up the best way possible. We do not have a marriage date set yet (COVID, ugh!) but I prefer to quit my job/career after we are officially married. I just feel it is safer this way? We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also discussing doing a prenuptial agreement, but I guess that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another question! He feels we can easily make more through his business (with my help) than my six-figure job, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never not had a paycheck. Is it fair that I ask for a salary, or just help him grow the business if he continues to pay for everything? Just thinking down the road if things go sideways, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve set myself up fairly to be protected. Am I over thinking this? Curious in Missouri The Moneyist: My sister-in-law moved in with her mother, changed her will, set up a new trust and inherited everything. Is it too late to claim what rightfully belongs to us? Dear Curious, Your last question is the easiest answered. No, you are not over thinking this. You are asking all of the right questions, and your concerns (if that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what they are) are well founded. But before I get to your first question about asking him for a salary, I have a question for you. Do you enjoy your job and the independence that brings? Be very careful about giving up a profession that pays well and one that you have worked hard for and gives you a separate creative, social and intellectual outlet. It serves two very important purposes in your life: It gives you a separate identity to your husband, financial independence, and it splits the financial risk you both share. If people decide they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford landscaping during COVID-19, you will both have your salary to rely on. If his job goes, you will hopefully have your job too. He is clearly very excited about his business, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s five years old and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important not to allow his excitement (n\u00c3\u00a9e ego) overwhelm your work life too. The Moneyist: My mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s will says her boyfriend can live in her home after she dies. Can I still kick him out if the deed is transferred to me? Think long and hard about this decision and wait until you are married to make it. Not earning a salary will also affect your Social Security contributions. Giving up your sole source of income, your job and any future chances of promotion should not be taken before you marry and nor should it be taken before you have agreed on a prenuptial agreement. These are all slices of the same pie. I hope you have the wedding you have always dreamed of if and/or when there is a vaccine available. But more importantly, I hope you have the marriage and life you have envisioned for yourself. Above all things, your partnership should be equal. If one person holds all the financial chips, it will inevitably give the other more leverage in other parts of the relationship, which can lead to too many compromises and, ultimately, resentment. If you were the one with the landscaping business, would you ask him to give up his six-figure job? That too is a question worth asking.

The U.S. still has the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s highest number of COVID-19 cases (6,520,235 and 194,081 deaths), followed by India (4,846,427), Brazil (4,330,455) and Russia (1,059,024), according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. The Dow Jones Industrial Index DJIA, +0.56% and the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% closed up modestly Friday, but the Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39% ended lower, and had its worst week since March. Doubts about traction for further fiscal stimulus from Washington and the right-sizing expectations about a vaccine are likely two factors currently concerning investors."}]}
