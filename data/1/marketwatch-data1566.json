The British pharmaceutical giant, one of the companies in the race to develop a coronavirus vaccine, said trials are taking place in the U.K., Brazil and South Africa and are due to start in the U.S. These trials will determine how well the vaccine will protect from the Covid-19 disease, the company said. AstraZeneca's net profit for the quarter was $756 million compared with $130 million for the year-earlier period. Core earnings per share--a closely-watched company metric that strips out exceptional items--rose 32% to $0.96, against expectations of $0.88, according to a consensus provided by FactSet and based on estimates by eight analysts. Quarterly sales rose 8% to $6.28 billion, ahead of a FactSet-provided consensus of $6.22 billion. AstraZeneca said its guidance for 2020 remains unchanged, and that it continues to expect total revenue to increase by a high single-digit to a low double-digit percentage and core EPS to increase by a mid- to high-teens percentage. The board declared an unchanged interim dividend of $0.90 a share."}]}
