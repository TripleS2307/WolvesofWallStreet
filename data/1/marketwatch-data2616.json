Unlike an earlier round of stress tests this year, the Fed will release the results of the tests for each bank, rather than providing aggregate results for the group. That means investors and the public will have a better understanding of the health of each of the 33 lenders when it comes to lending through the downturn. Designed to gauge the health of the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s banking system, the stress tests were expanded this year to study the effect of downturn brought on by the pandemic. The Fed said in June that U.S. banks were strong enough to withstand the crisis, based on a series of hypothetical scenarios for the economy. In a sign of the uncertainty facing the industry and broader economy, the Fed required banks to resubmit updated capital plans this fall to reflect current stresses. On Thursday, the board said it would release the latest round of results by the end of the year. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Fed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stress tests earlier this year showed the strength of large banks under many different scenarios,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Randal Quarles, the Fed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s point man on regulation, in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlthough the economy has improved materially over the last quarter, uncertainty over the course of the next few quarters remains unusually high, and these two additional tests will provide more information on the resiliency of large banks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.
