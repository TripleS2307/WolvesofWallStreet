The WHO said there were more than 150,000 new cases of the coronavirus on Thursday, and about half of those cases came from the Americas. There have been more than 8.5 million cases in total, with nearly half a million deaths, since the virus first gained international attention in January. The U.S. has the most number of cases worldwide, with about 2.2 million cases and at least 118,000 deaths.
