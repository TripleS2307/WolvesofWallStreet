The three nations alleged that hacking group APT29, also known as Cozy Bear and said to be part of the Russian intelligence service, is attacking academic and pharmaceutical research institutions involved in coronavirus vaccine development. Britain\u2019s National Cybersecurity Centre made the announcement, which was coordinated with authorities in the U.S. and Canada. \u201cIt is completely unacceptable that the Russian Intelligence Services are targeting those working to combat the coronavirus pandemic,\u2019\u2019 Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said in a statement. \u201cWhile others pursue their selfish interests with reckless behaviour, the U.K. and its allies are getting on with the hard work of finding a vaccine and protecting global health.\u2019\u2019 The persistent and ongoing attacks are seen by intelligence officials as an effort to steal intellectual property, rather than to disrupt research. The campaign of \u201cmalicious activity\u2019\u2019 is ongoing and includes attacks \u201c\u201dpredominantly against government, diplomatic, think-tank, healthcare and energy targets,\u2019\u2019 the National Cybersecurity Centre said in a statement. It was unclear whether any information actually was stolen but the center says individuals\u2019 confidential information is not believed to have been compromised. Cozy Bear, also known as the \u201cdukes,\u201d has been identified by Washington as one of two Russian government-linked hacking groups that broke into the Democratic National Committee computer network and stole emails ahead of the 2016 presidential election. The other group is usually called Fancy Bear. The director of operations for the British cybersecurity center, Paul Chichester, urged \u201corganizations to familiarize themselves with the advice we have published to help defend their networks.\u201d The statement did not say whether Russian President Vladimir Putin knew about the vaccine research hacking, but British officials believe such intelligence would be highly prized. U.S. authorities have for month leveled similar accusations against China. FBI Director Chris Wray said last week, \u201cAt this very moment, China is working to compromise American health care organizations, pharmaceutical companies, and academic institutions conducting essential COVID-19 research.\u201d ___ Associated Press Writer Eric Tucker in Washington contributed."}]}
