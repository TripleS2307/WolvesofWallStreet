(Photo: Henry Ford Health System/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images.) Your employer might be well within its rights to impose a mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policy \u2014 but it\u2019s far more likely to try promoting and facilitating worker immunization before wielding that power, legal experts say. A safe, effective COVID-19 vaccine has not yet been approved. Seven vaccine candidates in the U.S. are in the clinical-trial phase with human participants, including four candidates \u2014 AstraZeneca AZN, +1.16% in partnership with the University of Oxford, BioNTech BNTX, +1.23% and partner Pfizer PFE, -0.27%, Moderna MRNA, +0.09% and Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +1.39% \u2014 that are in Phase 3 clinical trials, the final and most critical stage. Meanwhile, a declining share of people have expressed intent to take a coronavirus vaccine. Just 51% of U.S. adults say they would \u201cprobably\u201d or \u201cdefinitely\u201d get a COVID-19 vaccine if it were available to them today, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted Sept. 8 to Sept. 13 \u2014 a 21-percentage point drop from May. Three in four respondents said it was \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d likely that a vaccine would be used before its safety and effectiveness were fully understood. As employers seek to reopen brick-and-mortar workplaces and restore some semblance of normalcy, they may wonder whether it makes sense to mandate coronavirus vaccinations to protect employees\u2019 and customers\u2019 health, and reduce the likelihood of transmission on the job. Randi Weingarten, the head of the American Federation of Teachers, recently told Axios that her union would support the notion of school districts requiring teachers to take a Food and Drug Administration-approved COVID-19 vaccine in order to teach in schools, \u201cjust like we have vaccines that we require kids to take to be in school in normal times.\u201d\u2018Constitutional restrictions simply do not apply to private employers\u2019 So is your employer even allowed to mandate that you receive a COVID-19 vaccine before returning to a physical workplace? \u201cThe short answer is yes,\u201d Debbie Kaminer, a law professor at Baruch College\u2019s Zicklin School of Business, told MarketWatch. \u201cEmployers have significantly more freedom when it\u2019s an employer just enacting its own policy, and it\u2019s not a government-mandated policy \u2014 because constitutional restrictions simply do not apply to private employers.\u201d Sahar Aziz, a professor at Rutgers Law School, agreed. \u201cLegally, it will be difficult for you to refuse to take it, and still be able to go to work to that particular job,\u201d absent any government action, she said. But employers can\u2019t mandate a vaccine across the board, she added: There must be accommodations for employees based on medical or religious exemptions under anti-discrimination laws. \u201c The Commission \u2018is actively evaluating how a potential vaccine would interact with employers\u2019 obligations under the Americans with Disabilities Act, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the other laws the Commission enforces.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 EEOC spokesperson Workers with legitimate medical concerns about taking the vaccine could seek an exemption under the Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations to employees with disabilities absent \u201cundue hardship\u201d such as significant expense or difficulty. And those with \u201csincerely held\u201d religious beliefs might be able to get an accommodation under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, said Barry Hartstein, co-chair of the EEO & Diversity Practice Group at the employment law firm Littler. The bottom line, according to Hartstein: \u201cCould employers mandate it? Yes. Would it be illegal? No, with the exceptions of potential accommodations on religious or ADA grounds.\u201d Reached for comment, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission spokesperson Christine Saah Nazer referred MarketWatch to the agency\u2019s pandemic-preparedness guidance issued in response to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, which underscores the fact that an employee might be entitled to exemptions based on an ADA disability or a \u201csincerely held religious belief, practice or observance.\u201d \u201cGenerally, ADA-covered employers should consider simply encouraging employees to get the influenza vaccine rather than requiring them to take it,\u201d the document says. Nazer added in an email: \u201cThe Commission continues to closely monitor the developments of a COVID-19 vaccine and is actively evaluating how a potential vaccine would interact with employers\u2019 obligations under the Americans with Disabilities Act, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the other laws the Commission enforces.\u201d Kaminer, for her part, suggested that religious exemptions were unlikely to be required in this case. \u201cUnder federal law, employers do not need to accommodate religious employees (which would include a religious exemption from a mandatory vaccination policy) if an accommodation would result in a greater than \u2018de minimis\u2019 [minimal] cost,\u201d she explained in an email. \u201cSome states require a higher level of accommodation, typically defining undue hardship under their state religious accommodation statutes as \u2018significant difficulty or expense.\u2019\u201d \u201cRegardless of whether the standard is \u2018de minimis\u2019 or \u2018significant difficulty and expense,\u2019 in the midst of one of the worst public-health crises in the last century, with its severe health, educational and economic implications, mandatory vaccination policies without religious exemptions should meet this burden,\u201d Kaminer said.\u2018This is new terrain\u2019 An employer could fire an employee who refused to comply with a mandatory vaccination policy if there were no reasonable accommodation requested or needed, said employment lawyer and human-resources consultant Kate Bischoff. But would union membership protect an employee from having to follow a vaccine requirement \u2014 or, for that matter, from being fired for not complying with one? \u201cMaybe,\u201d Bischoff said. \u201cAn employer would have to negotiate with the union as this would be a mandatory subject of bargaining, but a union is unlikely to get in the way of this kind of safety issue.\u201d In the event that employees challenge a COVID-19 vaccine mandate in court, judges may be more likely than usual to side with workers over employers given potential safety concerns surrounding a novel vaccine, Aziz said. After all, she said, \u201cthis is new terrain.\u201d \u201cI think judges will be more sympathetic to at least the evidence that an employee would bring to argue, \u2018This is not safe; it should be illegal to require me to be vaccinated\u2019 \u2014 which is a distinction from the flu vaccine, which has been around for decades,\u201d she said. \u201c \u2018I suspect most employers are going to start with the voluntary-encouragement route, facilitating free and convenient vaccinations.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Sahar Aziz, a professor at Rutgers Law School A vaccine mandate could make more sense in certain workplaces Several states mandate that workers in health-care and long-term care facilities get vaccinated against influenza and other vaccine-preventable diseases. Health-care facilities often require that their employees get vaccinated, Kaminer added. \u201cPrior to the pandemic, [a vaccine mandate] was really pretty much limited to health-care facilities and nursing homes \u2014 but it\u2019s like it\u2019s a different world now,\u201d Kaminer said. A COVID-19 vaccine mandate might make more sense in certain environments that present high risk for virus transmission, such as a meatpacking plant, a crowded bar or a health-care facility, than it would in a workplace with few employees who can be safely spaced apart, Kaminer said. The question of whether to mandate the vaccine would come down to a cost-benefit analysis, she added. Carlos del Rio, an infectious-disease expert at Emory University who is involved in Moderna\u2019s vaccine trials, agreed that the type of employment would play a role in determining whether workers should be required to be vaccinated. He noted that \u201cimmunization rates go up when you mandate it.\u201d \u201cAssuming that the vaccine has good efficacy, I would prefer a mandate in the situations where you want to vaccinate,\u201d he said. \u201cThen you have less excuses, less possibility for people to not accept the recommendation.\u201dEmployers are unlikely to go the mandatory route Most employers are likely to be flexible on COVID-19 vaccination in the interest of avoiding conflict within the company, bad publicity and potential litigation, Aziz said, especially if employees are able to work remotely. She predicted companies would \u201ctry the path of least resistance\u201d before resorting to a mandate. To that end, employers might make the vaccine free for employees, offer vaccinations at work to reduce inconvenience, and/or educate employees about the vaccine to promote voluntary vaccination, she said. \u201cI suspect most employers are going to start with the voluntary-encouragement route, facilitating free and convenient vaccinations,\u201d Aziz said, adding that they could shift to mandating the vaccine if the workplace or surrounding community wasn\u2019t getting vaccinated at the desired rates. Employers may also be hoping the government will \u201cdecide for them\u201d and move to mandate a vaccine, Aziz added. State and local governments have mandated vaccines in the past. Anthony Fauci, the longtime National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director and the federal government\u2019s top infectious-disease doctor, told Healthline in a recent interview that he didn\u2019t think the government would \u201cever\u201d mandate a vaccine for the general public. \u201cI\u2019d be pretty surprised if you mandated it for any element of the general public,\u201d he said, noting that medical facilities may require workers to get vaccinated before interacting with patients. \u201cYou cannot force someone to take a vaccine.\u201dA vaccine won\u2019t be a magic bullet Employers should suggest and recommend a vaccine but not mandate it, Hartstein said, given the uncertainty over potential long-term side effects. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot up in the air because we don\u2019t have a vaccine; we don\u2019t know how it will work, whether you need to get one shot or two shots,\u201d Bischoff added. \u201cUntil we\u2019re to that point, this is all a fun critical-thinking game.\u201d In addition to gauging whether the vaccine is useful and effective, we will also need to understand more about the disease and its immunology, including what happens to people who have already had COVID-19, del Rio added. A vaccine will be critical in \u201chelping us get out of this mess,\u201d but it won\u2019t be the only solution, del Rio said: Masking and social distancing will still be necessary for some period of time until 60% to 70% of the population has been immunized or developed antibodies from the virus. \u201cBut the sooner we immunize people,\u201d he added, \u201cthe better off we\u2019re going to be.\u201d"}]}
