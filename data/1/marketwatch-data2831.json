It\u2019s when you put the three of them together that all the trouble begins. You have to meet up with the test subject. You have to extract the specimen. You have to send the specimen to the lab. You have to trust the lab\u2019s results. (This particular step is now officially known as \u201cthe Mike DeWine,\u201d in honor of the Republican governor of Ohio who got a false positive on his coronavirus test last week just as he was heading into the White House.) You have to report the results to the patient and anyone else with a right to see them. You might or might not have to deal with an insurance company, and you know what a barrel of fun that can be! And you have to achieve all this quickly enough that it actually does some good. There\u2019s no use discovering that someone was infected two weeks ago. In that amount of wait time, that one case could spread to half of New York. And these long test-result delays \u2014 a week, 10 days, even two weeks\u2014are still a maddening problem almost everywhere, as adults begin returning to the workplace and kids start returning to school. \u201cAs an employer, I\u2019d have a tough time asking my employees to come back to work in exactly the same way they did in January,\u201d said Andrew Shulman, the CEO of Mobile Health, a Manhattan-based occupational health company. \u201cThe risks are elevated, and so are people\u2019s fears. You have to deal with both of those.\u201d Pre-COVID, Shulman was already overseeing the testing of 200,000 people a year, most of them home-health aides or other medical personnel. Then, the coronavirus hit, and the demand for employee health screening has gone crazy. \u201cBefore,\u201d he said, \u201cwe were screening for measles, mumps and rubella. Coronavirus is a whole different kind of challenge. And there are so many additional complexities to making the system work now,\u201d starting with the sheer volume of the demand. \u201cA big part of it is making people comfortable coming back to work.\u201d If you can\u2019t test every employee \u2014 or you can\u2019t test every employee every day \u2014 can you come up with a system that identifies those most likely to be infected and focus the testing on them? That\u2019s the latest thicket that companies like Shulman\u2019s are guiding professional firms, charter schools, film shoots and other employers through. One increasingly popular approach: Every morning, a short questionnaire arrives by text on the employee\u2019s phone. Do you have a cough? Do you have a fever? Have you lost your sense of taste or smell? If the answers are no, no and no, a QR code pops up on the phone. Once the employee arrives at work, that code is flashed into a reader. A temperature check is made. If that comes back normal, the workday begins. And if the temperature\u2019s high or there\u2019s some other sign of trouble? \u201cThe COVID test is done right then and there,\u201d Shulman said. It\u2019s testing where it\u2019s needed most. Don\u2019t miss: The Great Return: How to get the wealthy to come back to New York City? Rituals like these could soon become a part of everyone\u2019s workday, as people begin to leave their homes and apartments and fill the office towers again. But why stop with that? There\u2019s an even more urgent challenge looming for New York City public schools, and it comes with an imminent deadline. Could these private-sector techniques work in public school? In less than a month, 700,000 students, 66,000 teachers and a whole army of cafeteria workers, school nurses, bus drivers and others begin an educational and public-health experiment in New York City called the \u201cblended option.\u201d Two or three days a week spent in the school building, two or three days a week of \u201cdistance learning\u201d at home. Will the kids wear masks in the hallways? Will the cafeteria tables be 6 feet apart? What happens when a girl sneezes? What if a boy goes home sick? Just thinking about all the possibilities is enough to give anyone a headache. But Mayor Bill de Blasio is promising to deliver. See: 97,000 kids tested positive for the coronavirus in just two weeks in July \u201cIf you look at what\u2019s happening in other places,\u201d the mayor said to New York parents on Monday. \u201cit probably causes you a certain amount of concern, a certain amount of doubt. But we\u2019re not those other places. We\u2019re the only major school district in America, the only major urban district, planning for in-person classes this fall.\u201d As for the details, those are being left to the system\u2019s 32 district superintendents and 1,866 principals.

The best he could muster was \u201clogistically difficult.\u201d \u201cThe alternative is going back to the way we were in the spring, and that didn\u2019t work for everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the proper planning, all this can be accomplished. But get ready for a lot of starts and stops. Open, close, open, close. Plan accordingly.\u201d Ellis Henican is an author based in New York City and a former newspaper columnist."}]}
