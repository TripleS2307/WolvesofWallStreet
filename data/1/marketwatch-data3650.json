He tweeted over the weekend that Dr. Anthony Fauci, his administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top infectious disease expert, was \u00e2\u0080\u009cWrong!\u00e2\u0080\u009d for suggesting the U.S. failed to properly respond to the outbreak, while other countries did. New COVID-19 cases reached 4.69 million in the U.S., with the death toll rising to 155,124, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. Nearly 1.5 million people have recovered.

Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s response on Saturday was emphatic: iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Meanwhile, the White House, Senate Republicans and House Democrats have reportedly made progress on a new coronavirus relief bill, but have yet to reach an agreement on restoring the $600-per-week supplemental unemployment benefit although that benefit expired on Friday. Admiral Brett Giroir, assistant secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services, was asked on NBC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cMeet the Press\u00e2\u0080\u009d on Sunday whether the U.S. can improve its testing strategy, tried to put it \u00e2\u0080\u009cin context\u00e2\u0080\u009d by saying testing was being used \u00e2\u0080\u009cselectively.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cObviously, we want to increase testing, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Giroir said. He emphasized that what was \u00e2\u0080\u009cincredibly important\u00e2\u0080\u009d to controlling the coronavirus was to wear masks, but that 85% to 90% of people had to wear masks and avoid crowds. When asked whether that means the U.S. should implement a national mask mandate, Giroir said it \u00e2\u0080\u009creally has to be voluntary by the American people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mandated by cities or states. Regarding Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continued touting of antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19, despite trials showing it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t provide a benefit, Giroir said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cRight now, hydroxychloroquine, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t recommend that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He did say, however, that therapies such as Gilead Sciences Inc.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s GILD, +0.82% \u00c2 remdesivir and steroids were effective, and that a vaccine was \u00e2\u0080\u009creally on the horizon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Meanwhile, the World Health Organization warned Monday that there might never be a \u00e2\u0080\u009csilver bullet\u00e2\u0080\u009d for the coronavirus, according to Agence France-Presse (AFP). That comes after Dr. Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota who predicted in January that the coronavirus would become the next pandemic, told MarketWatch that he believed Americans will be living with the coronavirus for decades.Latest tallies There are now 18.15 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 world-wide, the Johns Hopkins data show, and at least 690,624 people have died.

Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, +2.20% \u00c2 said Monday that it has started a Phase 3 trial for a treatment that aims to prevent COVID-19 infections in residents and workers in nursing homes. The trial, expected to enroll 2,400 people by September, will be conducted with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, with plans to release the late-stage data sometime in the fourth quarter. Lilly is testing an experimental antibody it developed with the privately held AbCellera Biologics Inc. to see if it can prevent infections in people who live or work in a facility that has recently reported a case of the coronavirus. The antibody was identified in the blood sample of one of the first people in the U.S. to test positive for the virus. Also Monday, AbbVie Inc. ABBV, +0.41%, Amgen Inc. AMGN, -1.41% \u00c2 and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.

CAR, +1.28% \u00c2 plans to offer $350 million in senior notes due 2027, joining the many companies issuing record amounts of debt during the pandemic. The 5.75% notes will be offered as additional notes under the debt dated as of July 2019, in which $400 million in 5.75% senior notes due 2027 were previously issued. The rental car company expects to use the proceeds from the notes offering to redeem $100 million of 5.50% senior notes due 2023, with the rest to be used for general corporate purposes. The company has said last week that it has $1.5 billion in liquidity at the end of the second quarter, and estimated that cash burn would be approximately $900 million, including $100 million in debt retirement. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Clorox Co.

Sales grew 21.9% to $1.98 billion to beat the FactSet consensus of $1.87 billion, as household and wellness sales, which includes cleaning and professional products, rose 33%.

The filing Sunday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Richmond, Va., came less than a year after Le Tote bought the chain from Hudson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bay Co. in a $100 million deal. Lord & Taylor has 38 locations in the U.S., according to the filing, and about 650 employees. Some of the stores, which have been closed since March due to the pandemic, reportedly had new \u00e2\u0080\u009cstore closing\u00e2\u0080\u009d signs put up Sunday. Department stores have been particularly hard hit by the pandemic, and Lord & Taylor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bankruptcy filing follows those by JCPenney Co. JCPNQ, -3.42%, Neiman Marcus Inc. and J.Crew Co. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Mack-Cali Realty Corp. CLI, -2.51% \u00c2 reported Monday adjusted funds from operations that missed expectations as revenue surprisingly fell, as the real-estate investment trust has experienced challenges as a result of the pandemic. Office collections averaged 96% during the quarter and 98% in July, while residential collections averaged 98% in the quarter and 99% in July. The company didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t provide financial guidance given the uncertainties associated with the pandemic. Interim Chief Executive MaryAnne Gilmartin said the company has begun its search for a permanent CEO. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Marathon Petroleum Corp. MPC, -3.21%, fresh from the sale of its gas stations to the owners of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain for $21 billion in the largest U.S. energy deal of the year, posted second-quarter earnings, showing a smaller-than-expected adjusted loss but revenue that lagged behind estimates. Revenue fell to $15.024 billion from $33.529 billion, below the $21.729 billion FactSet consensus. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur second quarter results reflect a full three months of the challenges COVID has created for our business,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Chief Executive Michael J. Hennigan said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe began April with demand at historic lows. Despite seeing some recovery during the quarter, demand for our products and services continues to be significantly depressed, particularly across the West Coast and Midwest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The company is indefinitely idling its Gallup and Martinez refineries and evaluating a strategic repositioning of Martinez to a renewable diesel facility. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on track to deliver $1.4 billion capex cuts and at least $950 million of operating expense cuts. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Menswear retailer Tailored Brands Inc. US:TLRD \u00c2 , the parent company of Men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank, filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Sunday, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Since July 1, Tailored Brands has missed interest payments on bonds, slashed its corporate workforce by 20%, announced plans to close up to 500 stores and was notified that it will be delisted by the New York Stock Exchange.

TSN, -1.71% \u00c2 reported third-quarter earnings that beat expectations. Beef sales fell to $3.65 billion from $4.16 billion last year, though the average price for beef rose 11.6%. Tyson attributed a reduced sales volume to lower capacity caused by a first-quarter fire at a production facility that led to its temporary closure. Average pork prices also rose, up 0.8%, with sales totaling $1.12 billion, down from $1.32 billion. Tyson chicken prices fell 2.4%, and chicken sales fell to $3.11 billion from $3.33 billion. Lower food-service demand hurt chicken sales, the company said. Tyson incurred COVID-19-related incremental expenses of $340 million during the quarter, including worker bonuses, testing and personal protective equipment. Tyson didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t provide guidance due to the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Beyond Meat Inc. BYND, +0.80% \u00c2 said Monday that its Beyond Burgers will be sold at Walmart Inc.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s WMT, +1.00% \u00c2 warehouse chain Sam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Club, and at BJ\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Wholesale Club Holdings Inc.
