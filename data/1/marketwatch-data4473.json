The 10-year note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.777% rose 2.9 basis points to 0.682%, its highest since June 24, while the two-year yield TMUBMUSD02Y, 0.156% rose 1.2 basis points to 0.164%. The 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, 1.576% gained 2.3 basis points to 1.433%. For the second quarter, the two-year note fell 3.8 basis points, the 10-year note picked up 3.8 basis points, and the 30-year bond yield added 6.4 basis points. What\u2019s driving Treasurys? As expected, the minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee, the U.S. central bank\u2019s rate-setting body, showed Fed officials holding further discussions on the potential for capping yields for certain maturities, otherwise known as yield-curve control. Even as expectations for the policy\u2019s adoption have gained ground, some like Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard have pushed back against yield-curve control. Most Fed officials agreed that the central bank should provide more clarity to financial markets about when the central bank might raise benchmark interest rates, otherwise known as \u201cforward guidance.\u201d Analysts say the Fed is likely to wait until September to take this step.

ADP also raised May\u2019s numbers to reflect that 3.06 million jobs were, in fact, added that month, instead of a loss of 2.76 million jobs as previously reported. The ADP data will be followed by the more widely-watched U.S. Labor Department jobs data on Thursday. MarketWatch-polled economists forecast the U.S. economy will have added 3.9 million jobs last month, after gaining 2.51 million jobs in May.

The Institute of Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing index for June jumped to 52.6%, from 43.1% in the previous month. Any number above the 50 mark indicates an expansion in economic activity.What did market participants\u2019 say? \u201cMy read of the discussion around yield caps is that it was too vague to be useful and that the Fed remains too conservative to commit to a new strategy at this stage,\u201d said Ed Al-Hussainy, senior interest rate and currency analyst at Columbia Threadneedle. \u201cIt\u2019s a resounding dovish theme is all in these various outlets the Fed uses to communicate the public,\u201d said Kevin Flanagan, head of fixed income strategy for WisdomTree, in an interview."}]}
