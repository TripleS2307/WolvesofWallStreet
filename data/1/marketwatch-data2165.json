The stock has shot up 20.1% over the past three sessions to close Friday at a record $1,650.71. Although Ives's new price target is 15% above Friday's closing price, he reiterated the neutral rating he's had on the stock since April 25, 2019, when his stock price target was at $275. \"To this point, robust Model 3 demand out of China remains a linchpin of success and appears to be on a run rate to hit 150k unit deliveries in the first year out of the gates for Giga 3 which is driving some strength for Tesla as well as Model Y deliveries starting to ramp as well,\" Ives wrote in a note to clients. \"Looking ahead, we believe Musk & Co. are slated to announce a number of new potential \"game changing\" battery developments at its highly anticipated Battery Day on Sept. 22.\" Tesla's stock has more than doubled (up 106.6%) over the past three months through Friday, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% has advanced 17.8%."}]}
