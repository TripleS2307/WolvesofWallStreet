FB, +0.26% Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg's voice to the chorus of tech executives who expect a long-term shift to work-from-home employees. During the company's earnings call on Thursday, Zuckerberg said, \"There's currently no end in sight for when our teams here will be able to return to our offices. It is incredibly disappointing because it seems like the U.S. could've avoided this current surge in cases if our government had handled this better.\" On Monday, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, +1.82% GOOG, +1.97%, came to a similar conclusion. \"To give employees the ability to plan ahead, we are extending our global voluntary work from home option through June 30, 2021, for roles that don't need to be in the office,\" Pichai said in an email to employees."}]}
