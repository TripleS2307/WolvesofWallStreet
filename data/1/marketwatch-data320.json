Getty Images Facebook Inc. on Wednesday announced that political ads in the U.S. will be banned for at least a week after polls close Nov. 3, the social-media company\u2019s latest move to limit the spread of election misinformation on its platforms. \u201cWhile ads are an important way to express voice, we plan to temporarily stop running all social issue, electoral, or political ads in the U.S. after the polls close on November 3, to reduce opportunities for confusion or abuse,\u201d the company announced in a blog post. \u201cWe will notify advertisers when this policy is lifted.\u201d The ban is expected to last a week, but that could change, according to Sara Schiff, Facebook\u2019s product lead for political advertising. \u201cThese are important steps for Facebook to take to combat disinformation and the premature calling of election results before every vote is counted,\u201d Vanita Gupta, chief executive of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said in a statement. Facebook\u2019s FB, +0.26% move is the latest in a series of measures to preserve election integrity, after its platforms were used to spread misinformation and disinformation ahead of the 2016 election. On Tuesday, the company said it is banning all content from QAnon across its platforms, one of its most aggressive actions yet to tamp down misinformation on its platforms. In August, the social-media company removed 1,500 pages, groups and profiles associated with the group. Last month, Facebook took its first action to limit political advertising in the U.S. with a ban of news ads in the week preceding the Nov. 3 elections amid unrelenting criticism that its platform fuels misinformation and is a haven for far-right groups. The social-networking company says it has helped register 2.5 million people to vote, and it has helped 100,000 people sign up as poll workers. Facebook is one of several companies with social media presences that are frantically shoring up defenses to avoid a repeat of the misinformation campaigns that plagued their services.
