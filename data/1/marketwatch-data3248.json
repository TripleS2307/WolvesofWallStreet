Discussions for a deal continue between the administration, Oracle, and TikTok, unnamed sources told Bloomberg. ByteDance Ltd., the parent company of TikTok, would let Oracle review TikTok's source code and software to ensure there are no digital backdoors that allow the Chinese government or others to access the data, according to a Wall Street Journal report. President Trump said he will be briefed on the deal on Thursday. Earlier Wednesday, a group of Republican senators sent a letter to the Trump administration outlining their opposition to the proposed deal."}]}
