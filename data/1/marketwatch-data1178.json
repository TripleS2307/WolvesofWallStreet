Historic blazes are raging across the western U.S. ahead of what scientists say is the typical peak of wildfire season. Hot and dry conditions are aggravating the situation and raising fresh alarm over the impact of climate change on natural disasters \u2014 except, it would seem, from presidential election foes Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Trump has blamed local leaders and forest management while granting emergency status to some states, which sends federal dollars their way, though Oregon says it is still waiting. Trump has granted California emergency status that will free up relief, but during the 2019 fires the president threatened to withhold FEMA funds. The White House on Saturday announced that the president plans to visit McClellan Park, Calif., on Monday for a briefing with local and federal fire and emergency officials. The announcement comes after weeks of no comment on the deadly blazes from Trump, which has drawn criticism from climate-change policy advocates. Trump\u2019s EPA has also rolled back several protections that are decades old for water and air quality at the behest of the fossil-fuel industry and other business lobbyists, citing cost and imperfect enforcement.

Read:Here\u2019s where Joe Biden has moved to the left \u2014 and where he hasn\u2019t Beyond the fires in California, Colorado, Oregon and other states, Hurricane Laura devastated parts of the Gulf Coast last month, only one of the recent major hurricanes that are common threats to high-population U.S. areas. Many Iowa crops were leveled when a derecho brought hurricane-force winds last month. Plus, rising average temperatures and extreme heat and its public health impact leave the medical field fretting about the burden of care in coming decades, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic strains the system. Extreme weather has historically had a shaky association to the broader issue of climate change; yes, weather and climate are two different factors. But scientists are increasingly tracking evidence that a warming Earth has upped the frequency, irregularity and impact of extreme weather events. \u201cScientific evidence suggests that the severity of prolonged droughts and heat waves has been exacerbated not only by rising temperatures but also by changes in atmospheric circulation patterns associated with recent climate change,\u201d says Charles Jones of the University of California, Santa Barbara. \u201cThese changes can enhance extreme fire-weather behavior.\u201d Oregon officials revealed on Thursday that an estimated half a million of the state\u2019s residents, more than 10% of its population, had been evacuated from their homes due to the fires. Gov. Kate Brown, a Democrat, said Oregon is now approaching 900,000 acres burned. \u201cTo put that number into perspective,\u201d she said, \u201cin the last 10 years, we see an average of 500,000 acres burn in an entire year. We\u2019ve seen that nearly double in the past three days.\u201d Read:Deadliest fire of the year in California leaves 10 dead The left-leaning policy group Climate Power 2020 on Thursday tallied up the president\u2019s no- comment approach to climate change and the fires. \u201cPresident Trump hasn\u2019t mentioned the wildfires in any way, shape or form since Aug. 23, nearly three weeks ago,\u201d the group wrote. \u201cDuring that time, Trump held 46 public events where he could have addressed the crisis and devastation. Nor has Trump tweeted about the wildfires from his personal account. When he did last address the fires in mid-August, he blamed California for the wildfires and said \u2018you gotta clean your floors.\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018The Biden campaign understands that a full embrace of an aggressive climate-change agenda could create problems for them in Upper Midwest.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Political adviser Dan Schnur Connecting climate-change policy and the latest disasters is also touchy territory for Biden, say political analysts, because the former vice president has delicately laid out his environmental platform to maintain some separation from the Democratic Party\u2019s most progressive arm. It\u2019s not clear whether Biden approves of fracking in key state Pennsylvania or of other fossil-fuel exploration and drilling, and he has appeared to waver at times as his campaign nears the Nov. 3 election.

Biden-Harris climate platform remains fluid Other toss-up states feature in the energy debate, too. \u201cThe Biden campaign understands that a full embrace of an aggressive climate-change agenda could create problems for them in Upper Midwest,\u201d Dan Schnur, who served as an adviser to former California Gov. Pete Wilson and Arizona Sen. John McCain, told the Associated Press. Progressives and even some middle-of-the road Democrats largely back the Green New Deal \u2014 the policy outline with a big price tag that promotes renewable energy, green job creation and a march toward zero carbon emissions. It was advanced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Edward Markey last year, and throughout the Democratic primaries most candidates and now the Democratic National Committee adopted some portion of the plan as their own. Biden\u2019s plan mimics much of the Green New Deal, but far from all. Read:Climate change is huge risk for the American financial system, a major new bipartisan report says The Biden campaign\u2019s response to the fires is especially notable as his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, represents California in the Senate. She was campaigning in Miami this week, but her campaign told the AP that Biden and Harris \u201chave been closely monitoring the wildfires raging across the state and highlighting the urgent need to address the threat of climate change.\u201d Biden tweeted that climate change \u201cis already here \u2014 and we\u2019re witnessing its devastating effects every single day.\u201d Related:Kamala Harris has a particular climate-change agenda: environmental justice Biden\u2019s top advisers note that many of his proposals will move the country toward the Green New Deal, but some activists worry it is not ambitious enough and that the extreme weather is real-time evidence that lawmakers and presidential leadership are already behind the curve. Trump, charging that polluters China, India and others don\u2019t do enough, has pulled the U.S. from the Paris Climate Accord, an international, voluntary effort that aims to limit the global average temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius and ideally 1.5 degrees. Some analysts say Democrats are likely to crank up the climate-change-disaster rhetoric when and if they have greater political cover. \u201cInvestors frequently ask how we would rank the Democrats\u2019 priorities in 2021 to which we semi-facetiously suggest: (1.) Economy, (2.) Jobs, (3.) Climate as a tool for supporting economy and jobs,\u201d said Benjamin Salisbury and Josh Price of Height Securities, in a note. \u201cWe believe that the Democrats are set on a path to interlock employment, justice and climate policy in a way that prioritizes environmental regulation should they win control.\u201d This week, Senate Democrats released a resolution called the THRIVE agenda that asserts the \u201cduty of the Federal Government [is] to respond to the crises of racial injustice, mass unemployment, a pandemic, and climate change with a bold and holistic national mobilization.\u201d The resolution includes a net-zero target for the electric sector by 2035, in line with Biden\u2019s proposal. In addition, it makes union employment and restarting domestic manufacturing integral to climate and labor strategies. THRIVE earned the endorsement of Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, who would set the agenda if the Democrats win the Senate. Schumer did not sponsor the Green New Deal resolution, on which Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called a show vote in February 2019, when the ink was barely dry on the policy framework. \u201c \u2018No. 1 since Teddy Roosevelt. Who would have thought, Trump is the great environmentalist?\u2019 \u201d \u2014 President Trump, in Florida Some of the energy-sector policy targets are concerning to Republican lawmakers and right-of-center trade groups that are seeking their own approach to slowing man-made climate change, including Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, the R Street Institute and others. They desire a unified federal carbon-credit program and more balance in keeping heating and cooling costs low for Americans by including fossil fuels in a diverse energy mix, and they promote carbon sequestration as a way to harness emissions. Those issues are among the key facets of the proposed GOP-led Growing Climate Solutions Act, a main challenger to Democratic ideas resembling the Green New Deal. Key election states and their links to climate change wasn\u2019t lost on the Trump campaign earlier this week when the president, in Florida, announced an expansion of the ban on oil drilling off the coasts of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina. Trump touted himself as the No. 1 environmentalist \u201csince Teddy Roosevelt ... \u201d And as the GOP works toward its own environmental platform, largely one that keeps fossil fuels in a diverse energy mix, Trump\u2019s shrug on climate change and extreme weather may have consequences for him and the party. More younger voters who identify as Republicans now consider climate change fact than fiction. \u201cThe President can\u2019t wash his record, no matter how hard he tries,\u201d said Monica Medina and Miro Korenha, writing in the Our Daily Planet newsletter. \u201cWhile it\u2019s doubtful that most people believe President Trump when he touts his environmental accomplishments, do they buy his rhetoric that environmental policy is bad for the economy? Likely not,\u201d they argued. \u201cA recent survey from Resources for the Future showed that the public is perhaps starting to see past the false dichotomy that action on climate change and protection of the environment comes at the direct expense of the economy.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report."}]}
