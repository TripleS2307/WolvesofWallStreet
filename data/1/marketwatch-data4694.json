PM, +0.70% shares rose 3.3% in Tuesday premarket trading after the Marlboro parent reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that beat expectations. Net income totaled $1.95 billion, or $1.25 per share, down from $2.32 billion, or $1.49 per share, last year. Adjusted EPS was $1.29, well ahead of the FactSet consensus for $1.10. Revenue totaled $6.66 billion, down from $7.70 billion last year but ahead of the $6.50 billion FactSet consensus. Cigarette shipment volume was down 17.6% while heated tobacco unit shipment volume, which includes the company's IQOS product, was up 24.3% for the period. IQOS users totaled 15.4 million by quarter-end, of which Philip Morris says 11.2 million made the switch from cigarettes. Philip Morris has been touting its heated tobacco product as an alternative to cigarettes, and recently got FDA approval to market the product as a \"modified risk\" item. The company says that certain cigarette production facilities have been impacted by COVID-19, but those facilities account for less than 5% of production capacity around the world. As of June 30, the company had approximately $4.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand. For the full year, Philip Morris forecasts EPS of $4.84 to $4.99, and adjusted EPS of $4.92 to $5.07. The FactSet consensus is for EPS of $4.92. Philip Morris' forecast assumes that none of the company's key markets will undergo another lockdown, though the company doesn't anticipate a recovery in duty-free sales given uncertain global travel conditions. Philip Morris stock is down 14.3% for the year to date while the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% has edged up 0.7% for the period."}]}
