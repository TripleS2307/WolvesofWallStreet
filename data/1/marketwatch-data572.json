AAPL, +1.74% announced a new fitness subscription service Tuesday as well as new bundling options that will let users sign up for multiple Apple subscriptions at once and get a discount over what they would've paid if they subscribed to these services separately. The Apple Fitness+ service offers a library of workouts meant to work with the Apple Watch. It will cost $9.99 a month or $79.99 a year and feature workouts for treadmills, cycling, rowing, yoga, and more. Apple is also bundling its subscription services for the first time in an offering called Apple One. The individual plan of Apple One lets a single user access Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, and 50GB of iCloud storage for $14.95 a month. A family plan costs $19.95 for those three subscription services plus 200GB of iCloud storage for up to six family members. A \"premier\" plan, available in certain countries, adds Apple News+ and Apple Fitness+, while also upping the amount of shared family iCloud storage up to 2TB, for $29.95 a month. Users will get a 30-day free trial of services they don't already have. Shares of Apple are up 1.5% in midday trading."}]}
