The U.S. now has 5.25 million confirmed cases, and 167,253 people have died, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University, the most in the world by a wide margin. The U.S. has the fourth highest number of deaths per 100,000 people at 51.08, the data show, after the U.K., Peru and Chile. Robert Redfield, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, warned this week that America is bracing \u201cfor the worst fall, from a public health perspective, we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d That\u2019s because the flu season is expected to start in October and continue through February, while COVID-19 remains uncontained in most of the United States. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have COVID in the fall, and we\u2019re going to have flu in the fall. And either one of those by themselves can stress certain hospital systems,\u201d Redfield said, noting many hospitals have already been overwhelmed by the number of coronavirus patients. There have been reports of hospitals in Texas and Arizona calling in refrigerated trucks to serve as temporary morgues to handle the volume of dead bodies, as New York had done at the peak of infections there. The flu has seen between 140,000 and 810,000 people hospitalized each year since 2010. President Donald Trump used his Thursday coronavirus press briefing to bash Joe Biden\u2019s call for a national mask mandate; challenge the security of mail-in voting; and question the eligibility of Kamala Harris, a California native, to serve as vice president. Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, called for a national mask mandate to limit the spread of COVID-19, and said it could save 40,000 lives in a three-month period. That message matches the advice of public health experts who maintain that, in the absence of a vaccine, the best ways to contain the spread are to wear a face mask in public places, wash your hands frequently and socially distance from others. Globally, at least 760,761 people have died of COVID-19, the Johns Hopkins data show. At least 13 million people are confirmed to have recovered. Brazil is second to the U.S. with 3.2 million cases and 105,463 deaths. India is third measured by cases, with its total rising to 2.5 million, followed by Russia with 910,778 and South Africa with 572,865. Mexico has 505,751 cases and 55,293 deaths, the third highest in the world. India now has 48,040 deaths, putting it ahead of the U.K. That country has 315,600 cases and 46,791 fatalities, the highest in Europe and fifth highest in the world. China, where the illness was first reported late last year, has 89,144 cases, and 4,700 fatalities In other news: \u2022 A number of countries in Europe are taking steps to order holiday makers returning from places with rising case numbers to quarantine or be tested, as early hot spots, including Spain and Italy, are seeing a resurgence of infections.

The move takes effect on Saturday, prompting some travelers to rush back to skirt the requirement.

Vietnam was praised early on in the pandemic for successfully containing infection but has recently seen more than 20 deaths after an outbreak in the coastal city of Danang. The Russian vaccine has been registered after Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials involving at most a few hundred patients. New medicines are typically only approved after going through a Phase 3 trial involving thousands of patients. Most experts are skeptical the Russian vaccine will prove safe or effective.

Opinion: Here\u2019s a pandemic stock tip: Buy on the rumor of a COVID-19 vaccine, sell on the newsWhat\u2019s the economy saying? Sales at U.S. retailers rose modestly in July and returned to precrisis levels, but growth has tapered off since the economy reopened and could soften again in the months ahead in the absence of another major federal relief package, MarketWatch\u2019s Jeffry Bartash reported. Retail sales rose 1.2% in July, the government said Friday. Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast a 2% advance. Receipts have slowed from a 8.4% increase in June and a record 18.3% gain in May, when an economic rebound began. Retailers have been on a roller-coaster ride since the pandemic began, sinking in March and April and recovering rapidly in the following two months as the economy reopened. The more mild increase in sales in July might be a sign of what lays ahead, however. What the July Jobs Report Tells Us The resurgence of coronavirus cases this summer sapped the economy of momentum, delayed the return of people to their jobs and in some cases spurred more layoffs. At the same time, a $600 federal unemployment benefit expired at the end of last month, and Washington is deadlocked over another major aid package. \u201cFrom here on, the recovery in consumer spending as measured in the retail-sales report is likely to be a lot more grudging,\u201d said chief economist Joshua Shapiro of MFR Inc. Separately, industrial production rose 3% in July for the third straight monthly gain after sharp declines in March and April, the Federal Reserve reported Friday. The gain in July was above Wall Street expectations of a 2.7% gain, according to a survey by MarketWatch. Production in June was raised to a 5.7% gain from the earlier estimate of a 5.4% increase. Despite the strong gains over the past two months, production is below precrisis levels, the Fed said. The index is 8.4% below its prepandemic February level. A consumer-sentiment indicator edged up to 72.8 in August from 72.5. in July, but it\u2019s still just barely above the pandemic low, the University of Michigan said Friday. Americans regained some confidence in the early stages of the recovery in May and early June, but their hopes for a faster rebound were dashed by a fresh outbreak of the coronavirus during the summer.

An index that measures attitudes right now slipped to 82.5 from 82.8. An index that measures expectations for the next six months rose slightly to 66.5 from 65.9. Yet most Americans think it will be years before the economy returns to normal. \u201cBad economic times are anticipated to persist not only during the year ahead, but the majority of consumers expect no return to a period of uninterrupted growth over the next five years,\u201d said Richard Curtin, the chief economist of the sentiment survey. Here\u2019s the latest news on companies and COVID-19: \u2022 Alaska Air Group Inc. ALK, +0.15% expects total revenue to be down 70% to 75% in August from a year ago, after a 73% decline in July, as the pandemic has crushed demand for air travel.

Boston-based DraftKings ended the quarter with more than $1.2 billion in cash after a follow-on offering.
