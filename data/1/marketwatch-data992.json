In a speech in New Castle, Del., the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said if Americans want to reward work, \u201cwe have to ease the financial burden of care that families are carrying.\u201d The former vice president calls for universal preschool for three-and four-year olds; offers low-income and middle-class families a tax credit of up to $8,000 to help pay for child care; and proposes eliminating the current waitlist for home and community services under Medicaid. Biden\u2019s campaign says the 10-year plan will be paid for by \u201crolling back unproductive and unequal tax breaks\u201d for real-estate investors making more than $400,000, as well as increasing \u201ctax compliance for high-income earners.\u201d The speech marked the third plank of what Biden calls his \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d plan. Biden has previously announced a $2 trillion clean-energy plan and a $700 billion proposal aimed at increasing government purchasing of American-made products. Now see:Biden calls for $2 trillion in clean-energy spending and zero power-plant emissions by 2035. The plan comes as Biden is leading President Donald Trump in national polls of voters and in surveys of battleground states including Arizona and Pennsylvania ahead of the elections in November. Biden, who has criticized Trump for what he says is his failure to address the COVID-19 pandemic, charged that the president hasn\u2019t been able to explain how he\u2019ll help working families. \u201cHe\u2019s quit on you. He\u2019s quit on this country,\u201d Biden said of the president. The Trump campaign said in a statement that Biden\u2019s plans will translate to fewer jobs and higher taxes on middle-class families. \u201cJust like the rest of the radical Democrats who have co-opted his campaign, the only thing Biden knows how to do is raise taxes, kill jobs, and pass regulations that strangle small businesses,\u201d said the campaign."}]}
