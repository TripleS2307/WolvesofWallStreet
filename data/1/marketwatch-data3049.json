The company GOOGL, +1.82% GOOG, +1.97% reported net income of $6.96 billion, or $10.13 a share, compared with net income of $9.95 billion, or $14.21 a share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue after removing traffic-acquisition costs declined to $31.6 billion from $31.7 billion in the year-ago period. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had estimated $7.95 a share on ex-TAC revenue of $30.66 billion on average. The second-quarter results, announced after the market\u2019s close Thursday, initially sent Alphabet shares up 2% in after-hours trading. But the results sunk to flat after investors digested a $2.6 billion decline in year-over-year advertising revenue. \u201cWe continue to navigate through a difficult global economic environment,\u201d Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in a statement announcing the results Thursday. She noted improvement in ad sales as the quarter progressed. \u201cWe\u2019re all grappling with a pandemic and uncertain economy,\u201d Alphabet Chief Executive Sundar Pichai added in a conference call with analysts later. Though $29.9 billion of Google\u2019s total quarterly revenue of $38.3 billion came from advertising, underscoring its dependence on a struggling market, there were bright spots. Sales from Google Cloud and YouTube continued to swell in a growing sign of versatility in the company\u2019s overall product line \u2014 YouTube ad revenue increased 6%, to $3.8 billion from $3.6 billion a year ago, while Google Cloud sales grew 43%, to $3 billion from $2.1 billion. Google\u2019s softening sales, especially in travel, punctured its previous quarter\u2019s performance and will most likely continue throughout the year. Monness Crespi Hardt analyst Brian White warns Google not only faces increased competitive pressure from Facebook Inc. FB, +0.26% , Amazon, Snap Inc. SNAP, -0.18% , and Twitter Inc. TWTR, -0.23% but serious antitrust investigations around its ad business.

AMZN, +3.01% , Google last week said it will eliminate commission fees for retailers. \u201cLong run, I see a growth opportunity,\u201d Pichai told analysts during the call. Google is navigating an industry badly battered by the pandemic in the spring, and bracing for another rough quarter if a second national lockdown occurs. The good news is digital advertising is getting the bulk of spending, at the expense of broadcast and print media. \u201cThere is a truism that in advertising a vast majority of spending tends to congregate in the second half of the year with Black Friday, the holiday season, and a rush to spend your budget,\u201d Julian Baring, general manager of Americas at digital media advertising company Adform, told MarketWatch in a phone interview Thursday. \u201cOn the other hand, when the economy takes a downturn, ad spending tends to go first.\u201d This makes the second half of 2020 all the more crucial for Google, JMP Securities analyst Ron Josey told MarketWatch in a phone interview. He rates Google shares as outperform, with a price target of $1,500. \u201cGoogle\u2019s new reporting metrics are helpful.\u201d Longer term, Josey and others are keeping a close eye on antitrust investigations of Google\u2019s ad business over the coming months, and how it may impact operations. On Wednesday, Pichai, Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.74% CEO Tim Cook, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +3.01% CEO Jeff Bezos, and Facebook Inc. FB, +0.26% CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before the House on their business practices and enormous market power.

When pressed during the conference call on the regulatory climate, Pichai said he is confident in Google\u2019s focus on users and offering them plenty of product choices at lower prices. \u201cWe operate by the rules, and if we need to change [business operations to adhere to rules], we will,\u201d he said. Alphabet shares are up 15% in 2020. The broader S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% is down 0.% this year."}]}
