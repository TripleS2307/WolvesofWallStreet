VFC\u2019s VFC, -0.91% portfolio includes The North Face, Timberland and Eagle Creek. Speaking at the Stifel Cross Sector Insights Virtual Conference on Wednesday, VFC Chief Executive Steven Rendle highlighted four trends, which he says were growing even before COVID-19 and are accelerating after the pandemic, including an \u201cappreciation for the outdoors.\u201d \u201c[W]e\u2019ve seen a nice uptick, as an example, in our North Face equipment business,\u201d Rendle said, according to a FactSet transcript. See:RH is planning to open hotels and sell houses, but analysts ask whether it can pull it off \u201cPeople purchasing tents and sleeping bags at a higher rate and then sharing the experiences that they\u2019re creating with\u2026 their families in the backyard, sleeping outside, cooking dinner over their camp stoves, but really trying to generate some new excitement in a stay-at-home environment.\u201d Some are vacationing in the wild. \u201c[A]s states and countries begin to reopen, we are seeing an uptick in outdoor participation in national parks and outdoor environments where people typically would take a more multiday approach to the outdoors,\u201d Rendle said. \u201cAnd our North Face, Timberland, SmartWool, Icebreaker brands are very, very well-positioned.\u201d Even when consumers aren\u2019t camping, they\u2019ve become more casual during these lockdown periods. VFC is also the parent company for Vans, an athletic brand known for its laid-back, skateboard lifestyle aesthetic. \u201c[T]he work that we\u2019ve done to reshape our portfolio [to] position ourselves in this total addressable market of outdoor, active and athleisure, and this area of work lifestyle is really paying great dividends, Rendle said. VFC is positioned to capitalize on the tailwinds of \u201cbeing purpose-led and performance-driven, enabling us to... be well-suited to accelerate as everything comes back to a new normal,\u201d he said.

Shoppers were once snapping up items like pajamas and loungewear to be comfortable at home, a trend that Target Corp. TGT, +1.14% highlighted. Now, they\u2019re moving toward recreational gear. \u201cApparel was a low priority early in the COVID-19 crisis when consumers were focused on things like groceries and other in-home necessities, but we\u2019re seeing evidence that apparel is once again entering the spending consideration set,\u201d said Maria Rugolo, apparel industry analyst for NPD in a May 28 report. \u201cWarmer weather is spanning much of the country, allowing consumers to extend their mostly homebound routines to the outdoors, and expanding their apparel needs beyond comfort and above-the-keyboard dressing.\u201d Baird analysts also note the fitness and outdoor trend, but remain cautious. The lack of tourism is a headwind, analysts say. High unemployment is a deterrent to spending, and whether there is another stimulus package is to be determined. Don\u2019t miss:Mnuchin says Trump administration will \u2018seriously look\u2019 at sending out more stimulus checks Baird rates VFC stock outperform with a $66 price target, citing recent momentum for both The North Face and Vans brands. In addition to these trends, Stifel analysts cite VFC\u2019s move to more direct-to-consumer sales and growing brand strength abroad as assets for the business. \u201cCompared to other brands in the portfolio, Vans and Dickies reportedly performed better and will likely be leaders in portfolio stabilization,\u201d analysts said. \u201cVans benefits from consumer engagement and built in China growth. Dickies benefits from a small but growing Asia business, and sales through partners that had been deemed as essential businesses, like Walmart.\u201d Stifel rates VFC stock buy with a $75 price target. VFC reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that missed expectations in mid-May. VFC shares fell 3.9% on Thursday, and have fallen 39.7% for the year to date.
