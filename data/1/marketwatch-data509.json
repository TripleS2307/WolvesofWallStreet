The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund XLF, +0.11% was up 0.6% at midday, and the Vanguard Financials ETF VFH, -0.08% rose 0.8%. The Invesco KBW Bank ETF KBWB, -0.41% jumped 1.7%. In the month to date, that fund is on track for its best showing since April. Banks and financial institutions make money by borrowing and lending money at different rates, which is easier when there's a bigger spread between the two. That spread, known as the yield curve, is at its widest since December 2016, by one measure. It's harder for the yield curve to steepen when yields are so compressed, which is why investors think higher rates are better for banks."}]}
