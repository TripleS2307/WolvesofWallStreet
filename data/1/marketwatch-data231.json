Which is good news The outlook: The rolling review will save time on the approval process, but doesn\u2019t change anything to the clinical trials process, which will develop at pace. The regulator\u2019s decision isn\u2019t a political one, and contrary to what has happened in the U.S., there has been no pressure from European governments on the regulator to speed up the approval of vaccines currently being developed. The EMA insists in its release that it will wait for all the data from the completed trials before it makes a decision. But once they are in, the bureaucratic process of decision will be faster than it would have been for an ordinary drug.
