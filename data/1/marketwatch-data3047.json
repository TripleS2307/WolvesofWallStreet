The Who\u2019s Who of major brands that have either added their names to the #StopHateForProfit campaign or otherwise pulled their ads range from Coca-Cola Inc. KO, +0.69% and Starbucks Corp. SBUX, +0.53% to Ford Motor Co. F, -1.36% and Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +2.48%. \u201cWe do not profit from misinformation or hate,\u201d Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said on the conference call. The full scope of the boycott\u2019s financial damage won\u2019t be known until Facebook reports its third-quarter results. On the call, David Wehner, Facebook chief financial officer, said that the company\u2019s largest 100 advertisers accounted for just 16% of revenue in the second quarter, a slightly lower percentage that it was a year ago. Three-fourths of Facebook\u2019s revenue comes from small- and medium-sized companies, though it remains to be seen if those companies pull back on ad spending while in the grips of the worsening pandemic.

MAUs and DAUs are expected to be \u201cflat or slightly down in most regions\u201d in the third quarter as shelter-in-place restrictions ease, Wehner said. On the call, Zuckerberg said Facebook has more than 9 million active advertisers and cautioned that while ad boycotts could hurt Facebook\u2019s revenue, \u201cthe much bigger cost of such a move would be to reduce the effectiveness of the ads and opportunities for small businesses to grow.\u201d \u201cThis would reduce opportunities for small businesses so much that it would probably be felt at a macroeconomic level,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cAnd is that really what policy makers want in the middle of a pandemic and recession?\u201d Zuckerberg was one of four tech CEOs \u2014 Apple Inc.\u2019s AAPL, +1.74% Tim Cook, Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s AMZN, +3.01% Jeff Bezos, and Sundar Pichai of Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, +1.82% GOOG, +1.97% were the others \u2014 to testify before a House antitrust subcommittee on Wednesday. (Facebook was originally scheduled to report second-quarter results on Wednesday but pushed them back to Thursday.) Facebook shares are up 14% this year. The broader S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% is up 0.6% in 2020."}]}
