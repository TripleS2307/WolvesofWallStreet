HLT, -1.26% slipped 0.3% in premarket trading Thursday, after the hotel operator reported a second-quarter loss that was wider than expected, with revenue dropping 77%, as the COVID-19 pandemic had a \"significant adverse impact\" on occupancy. The company swung to a net loss of $430 million, or $1.55 a share, from net income of $260 million, or 89 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding non-recurring items, the adjusted per-share loss was 61 cents, compared with the FactSet loss consensus of 31 cents. Total revenue dropped to $564 million from $2.48 billion, below the FactSet consensus of $818.8 million. Revenue per available room (RevPAR) sank 81.0%, as occupancy fell 56.1 percentage points to 22.3% and the average daily rate declined 33.2% to $97.18.
