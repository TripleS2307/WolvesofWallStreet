European Union leaders ended a grueling four-day summit with an agreement on a \u20ac1.8 trillion ($2.1 trillion) budget and rescue-fund package aimed at shoring up the worst-hit economies in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, gold, a traditional haven asset, was also boosted on expectations fiscal stimulus efforts could stoke inflation and lead to a weaker U.S. dollar. A weaker dollar can be a positive for commodities priced in the currency, making them cheaper to users of other currencies. In Tuesday dealings, the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, -0.58% traded down nearly 0.8% at 95.10, the lowest level since March. \u201cClearly, the passage of the EU recovery fund combined with the beginning of negotiations on another U.S. stimulus package provides a solid backdrop for the bull camp,\u201d analysts a Zaner Metals wrote in a daily note, adding that the dollar, overnight, broke down to the lowest level since March 10. \u201cCurrency forces should be poised to add to the bull track.\u201d Gold for August delivery GC00, +2.17% on Comex rose $26.50, or 1.5%, to settle at $1,843.90 an ounce, after touching a high of $1,844.80. Prices based on the most-active contracts, haven\u2019t traded or settled at levels this high since September 2011, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Silver also surged, with the September contract US:SIU20 up $1.37, or 6.8%, to end at $21.557 an ounce after a high at $21.63. Most-active silver futures marked their highest settlement since March 2014. Read:Silver logs highest finish since 2014 and is up more than 80% from 2020\u2019s low \u201cSilver spot prices have outperformed gold so far this month, an interesting reversal of the norm,\u201d said Cailin Birch, global economist at The Economist Intelligence Unit. \u201cWe believe that this reflects growing market optimism around the outlook for global industry, given silver\u2019s many industrial uses.\u201d \u201cSeveral factors are probably contributing to this recent optimism, including the approval of a broad stimulus package by the EU commission and steadily improving economic and industrial activity in China, the main source of demand growth of industrial metals,\u201d she said in emailed commentary. Silver prices had settled early last week, and again on Monday, at the highest since September 2016.

But it\u2019s \u201call relative,\u201d he said. \u201cInvestors are looking for safety in gold and silver\u2019s ability to also provide a low-risk store of value,\u201d and that \u201cbuilds stronger investment inflows,\u201d feeding the price climb. Meanwhile, Europe\u2019s fiscal package \u201ccomes on the back of vast monetary support from the European Central Bank, as well as other major central banks around the world. In the U.S., talks are about to kick off on the next virus relief plan, which could see at least an additional $1 trillion added to the previous stimulus measures \u2013 especially as some of the existing measures are about to expire,\u201d said Fawad Razaqzada, analyst with ThinkMarkets, in a note. Other metals climbed as well, with platinum and palladium moving up sharply. October platinum PLV20, +3.99% rose 7.1% to $918.90 an ounce and September palladium US:PAU20 added 3.7% to $2,188.20 an ounce, for the highest settlement since late March. September copper US:HGU20 rose 1.5% to $2.958 a pound. \u201cThe platinum and palladium markets have begun to show very positive sensitivity in sync with gains in gold and silver prices,\u201d said analysts at Zaner Metals."}]}
