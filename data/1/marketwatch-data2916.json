Less than three months before November\u2019s election, 50% of registered voters nationally say they would vote for Biden if the election were held now, while 41% back Trump. That is essentially unchanged from Biden\u2019s 11-point lead a month ago and is similar to his advantage much of this year. Biden, however, is failing to generate widespread enthusiasm, the poll finds. For the past year he has been viewed more negatively than positively among the broader electorate \u2014 as has been the president \u2014 although Biden\u2019s positive rating increased 5 percentage points between July and August to reach 39%. \u201cThis poll is a warning for Democrats and the Biden team that there is still a lot of work to be done,\u201d said Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster who worked on the survey with Bill McInturff, a Republican, and Jeff Horwitt, a Democrat. In another sign of potential softness in the Democrats\u2019 support, 58% of those who back Biden say their vote is more in opposition to Trump than in favor of their chosen candidate. By contrast, those planning to cast a ballot for Trump are more enthusiastic about their choice, with almost three-quarters saying their vote is more for him than against Biden.
