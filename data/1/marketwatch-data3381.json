Back-to-school shopping is an expensive chore in a normal year; this year is anything but normal. But with August upon us, stores are putting out back-to-school displays in anticipation of children needing to learn, whether in the classroom or at home. Two-fifths (40%) of parents with children in K-12 or college anticipate their children will be attending classes in a hybrid environment (both in-person and remote) in the fall of 2020, according to a new NerdWallet survey conducted online July 16-20 by The Harris Poll among over 600 parents. Planning for multiple scenarios could result in the need for increased back-to-school spending, but many may not have the extra money this year. Nearly half (47%) of parents expect they\u2019ll spend less on back-to-school shopping than they otherwise would, due to the coronavirus pandemic, according to the survey. Of them, 40% say it\u2019s because their household income has been affected by the pandemic and related economic effects. On the other hand, one-fifth (20%) of parents expect to spend more this year on back-to-school purchases than they otherwise would, due to the pandemic. Of them, 54% think they\u2019ll be spending more to outfit a home learning environment, and 50% will be spending more to account for supplies for both in-person and at-home learning. \u201cSaving on back-to-school shopping takes some strategizing in a normal school year, but this year poses unique challenges: Not only is it harder to know what students might need, but many families are eyeing big purchases to make remote learning easier, including electronics and desks,\u201d says Kimberly Palmer, personal finance expert at NerdWallet. \u201cAt the same time, many families have less room in their budget to make new purchases because of the pandemic.\u201d1. Shop for the short term Whether you\u2019re spending less this year out of necessity or you\u2019re anticipating having to spend more: Buy only what you need. If 2020 has taught us anything, it\u2019s that well-laid plans can change. So purchase what you need to get the school year started and plan to supplement those purchases as the semester unfolds. You may find that some items get less expensive as the seasons change. \u201cUnless you have your eye on a specific type of computer or another item that could sell out, it\u2019s OK to wait to make your purchases until after the school year begins \u2014 in fact, that\u2019s when you see many of the best deals,\u201d Palmer says.2. Take advantage of credit card rewards More than half (53%) of parents who will back-to-school shop this year plan to use a credit card on those purchases, according to the survey. Putting your expenses on a cash-back credit card could put your money to work for you. You may even reap enough to cover next year\u2019s back-to-school expenses entirely. Just make sure you\u2019re able to pay off the balance each cycle, as interest can quickly negate any benefits.3. Check prices before and after shopping Price matching involves comparing identical items at other stores and asking a retailer to match a lower price. The trick may not make sense for a package of pencils, but for clothing, electronics and other higher-dollar items, a successful price match could save you tens of dollars, if not more.

Many will also refund the price difference if you spot a cheaper price within a certain time frame after the purchase.4. Team up to buy in bulk Regardless of where your child is learning this fall, they\u2019ll need supplies that other students are also after. By teaming up with other parents, you can purchase things like hand sanitizer and supplies for homework and note-taking in bulk. If your child\u2019s teacher is reluctant to give out parents\u2019 contact information, ask if they would send out yours in a group email so other parents can reach you if they\u2019re interested in group savings.

Shop on tax-free holidays Sixteen states are having sales tax holidays in August 2020. Most of them last through a full weekend, and some even longer. Retailers that offer online ordering for in-store pickup may require you to order and pick up on those particular days to reap the tax-free benefits. The specifics of each state\u2019s holiday vary, but generally, they allow you to purchase certain back-to-school items without paying sales tax.6. Practice and teach thriftiness If money is very tight, your child might be able to reuse some of last year\u2019s supplies such as their backpack or leftover pencils and notebooks. You can also shop secondhand on sites like Poshmark or thredUP for clothing throughout the school year. And don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help \u2014 many schools are putting programs in place that help outfit homes with the technology needed for remote learning.

Older kids can learn the complexities of managing a budget, a tool they\u2019ll need in adulthood, and younger ones can learn what saving money means and help you search for the lowest prices. \u201cSome communities are also organizing online volunteer opportunities for high-schoolers to help match up with elementary school children who need extra help, which can be a great way to provide learning opportunities to both age groups in a safe, free way,\u201d Palmer adds. \u201cThis school year will be unlike any other, which means parents and children will have to get more creative with stretching their back-to-school budgets.\u201dMore from NerdWallet: What to Know Before Laying Down Money for a Mattress What to Buy (and Skip) in February Here\u2019s When Everything Will Go on Sale in 2020 Elizabeth Renter is a writer at NerdWallet.
