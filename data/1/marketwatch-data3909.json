If they succeed, it wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be the first time Disney has tweaked an attraction in the face of changing societal norms and shifting attitudes. A petition on Change.org that has collected over 21,000 signatures is calling on Disney DIS, +1.53% \u00c2 to overhaul the ride Splash Mountain, which is based on the controversial 1946 Disney film \u00e2\u0080\u009cSong of the South.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The petition suggests that Disney reimagine the ride and use the 2009 animated film \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Princess and the Frog\u00e2\u0080\u009d as inspiration for the new version. On Twitter TWTR, -0.23%, others have suggested reworking the ride and basing it on other Disney animated films, including \u00e2\u0080\u009cMoana\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Emperor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s New Groove.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The petition comes as Americans are seeing some of their most beloved cultural hallmarks with new eyes as the country faces a national reckoning over race following George Floyd\u00e2\u0080\u0099s killing by Minneapolis police and weeks of Black Lives Matter protests. In some cases Americans are realizing that some of their happiest childhood memories also reinforce harmful racial stereotypes. HBO Max T, -1.01% for instance temporarily removed the 1939 movie \u00e2\u0080\u009cGone with the Wind\u00e2\u0080\u009d from its library, and the Paramount Network VIAC, -2.34% \u00c2 cancelled the long-running TV series \u00e2\u0080\u009cCops.\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Disney did not respond to requests for comment about changing Splash Mountain.) Splash Mountain, a log flume ride, is located at three Disney theme parks around the world: Walt Disney World\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Magic Kingdom in Florida, Disneyland in California and Tokyo Disneyland in Japan. While the three rides differ slightly from one another, all feature characters and stories from \u00e2\u0080\u009cSong of the South.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u201c Splash Mountain is based on \u00e2\u0080\u009cSong of the South,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which Disney has refused to release on DVD or its streaming platform Disney+. \u201d The film is based on a collection of Uncle Remus folk tales and include the Academy Award-winning song \u00e2\u0080\u009cZip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Since its original release, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSong of the South\u00e2\u0080\u009d has been criticized for its racist portrayal of African-Americans and the way it presents its plantation setting as appealing. The NAACP condemned the film when it was released (while also applauding its technical achievements), saying that it \u00e2\u0080\u009chelps to perpetuate a dangerously glorified picture of slavery.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Also see:\u00e2\u0080\u0098Disneyland reopening schedule looks like the unsafest thing ever\u00e2\u0080\u0099: Thousands sign petition asking to delay July opening The film has never been made available on VHS or DVD in the U.S., and Disney has said it would not include it on its video streaming platform, Disney+. On Twitter, Frederick Chambers, who says he is a Disneyland employee, posted a rendering of how Splash Mountain could be redone to tell the story from \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Princess and the Frog.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The post has been retweeted nearly 5,000 times and has garnered thousands more likes. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } In its current form, Splash Mountain is \u00e2\u0080\u009csanitized\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the problematic aspects of the movie it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s based on, Chambers said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe time has come to at least look at where our stories come from and how people of color are represented in films and the parks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Chambers told MarketWatch, noting that his comments and opinions were his own and do not reflect those of The Walt Disney Co. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMany guests are either unaware or simply do not care about this history,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Chambers added. A retheme on the scale of what fans have proposed for Splash Mountain may only come to fruition if Disney sees the ride\u00e2\u0080\u0099s connection to \u00e2\u0080\u009cSong of the South\u00e2\u0080\u009d as a liability. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very hard to know what Disney is thinking internally,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Don Munsil, co-owner of travel website MouseSavers.com. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRetheming a popular ride would be a huge undertaking, but for sure Disney would do it if they felt the ride was making significant numbers of guests uncomfortable or it was sending a message that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in keeping with company values.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDisney has a history of changing attractions to remove controversial references The controversy over Splash Mountain isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the first time Disney has been asked to revisit an attraction from a new perspective in light of changing attitudes about social justice. In 2018, Disney reworked another popular attraction, Pirates of the Caribbean,at Walt Disney World and Disneyland to remove a scene in which the ride\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pirates were shown auctioning women to be brides. In the new version of the ride, one of the red-headed women is now one of the pirates. Disney has also rebranded or renamed attractions to be more culturally sensitive. A ride at Disneyland that was called the Indian War Canoes was later changed to Davy Crockett\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Explorer Canoes. In 2001, Disney renamed a hotel at Walt Disney World that used to be called Disney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Dixie Landings Resort to Disney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Port Orleans Resort Riverside. \u201c Two years ago, Disney redid a scene on the attraction Pirates of the Caribbean in which women were depicted as being auctioned off as brides. \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you want to talk about a completely tone deaf set of choices, the center-most building [of Dixie Landings Resort] where you went in to check in and where you had your food was a cotton mill,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jim Hill, a theme park historian and blogger, told MarketWatch. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s evidence that Disney has considered \u00e2\u0080\u009cretheming\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Disney parlance for reworking \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Splash Mountain in the past. A Disney internal memo obtained by Hill and provided to MarketWatch outlines a possible iteration of Splash Mountain for Disneyland Paris. Disney officials floated theming the ride after the 1995 film \u00e2\u0080\u009cPocahontas\u00e2\u0080\u009d or Davy Crockett instead of \u00e2\u0080\u009cSong of the South,\u00e2\u0080\u009d citing Europeans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lack of familiarity with the \u00e2\u0080\u009cSong of the South\u00e2\u0080\u009d characters. Ultimately, Disney did not construct the ride. (Disney did not respond to requests for comment about the memo.)

The film was the first Disney movie to showcase a black princess. The film follows Tiana, a waitress from New Orleans, who hopes to own her own restaurant one day. While the film had a very strong opening weekend when it was released and received positive reviews, it was seen as somewhat of a disappointment, at least by investors. In a 2016 MarketWatch analysis of how Disney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stock performed following the release of its animated films, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Princess and the Frog\u00e2\u0080\u009d ranked No. 31 out of the 38 films analyzed.

The character of Tiana is already a major presence at Disney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s theme parks and cruise lines. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s featured in parades and meet-and-greets, and in 2009 a live show based on the film debuted at the Magic Kingdom. On Disney Cruise Lines, vacationers can dine at Tiana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Place, a restaurant based on the movie. But an entire ride inspired by \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Princess and The Frog\u00e2\u0080\u009d would be a different ball game, and could prove popular among visitors, experts said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a huge opportunity for Disney \u00e2\u0080\u0094 new rides bring in customers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Len Testa, president of travel website Touring Plans. (Testa confirmed to MarketWatch that he had signed the petition regarding Splash Mountain.) \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098This is a huge opportunity for Disney \u00e2\u0080\u0094 new rides bring in customers.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Len Testa, president of travel website Touring Plans Overhauling Splash Mountain isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a simple proposition though. Much of the ride\u00e2\u0080\u0099s structure, Hill said, is made of concrete, which makes redoing it more difficult than other attractions. Additionally, Splash Mountain qualifies as a thrill ride by Disney standards, which means it may not appeal to younger children who are the target audience of the film. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis would be something really that they would want to be friendly to 3-to-5-year-old girls and the height limit for Splash Mountain is kind of restrictive in that manner,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hill said. The bigger hurdle for Disney currently could be financial: The company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s theme parks around the world closed for months because of the coronavirus pandemic, and its parks in the U.S. are not set to reopen until July. The pandemic has already cost the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s theme-parks division $1 billion in profit, and the company has said it would reduce capital spending to compensate. Shares of Disney have been down 18% this year to date compared to a 9% decline for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% \u00c2 and a nearly 5% dip for the S&P 500 Index SPX, +0.87%. \u00c2"}]}
