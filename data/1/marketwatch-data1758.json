What is the wealth gap? It is the stark divide between how much capital white people and black people control. By one estimate, the typical white family has wealth of $171,000. This is nearly ten times greater than the $17,150 for an average black family. Put another way, the typical black household remains poorer than 80% of white households. This stunning wealth gap between the races has persisted, in good times and bad, for the past 70 years. It did not get better after the civil rights era legislation was passed in the 1960s or during the Obama administration. And it will continue to fuel unrest, economists said. \u201cAs long as we have racial wealth gap, we\u2019re going to have a problems with race,\u201d said Patrick Mason, an economics professor at Florida State University. \u201cThe wealth gap is one of the reasons there are protests today,\u201d said Linwood Tauheed, a professor of economics at The University of Missouri-Kansas City and the president of the National Economics Association. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily want to use the phase it was the straw that broke the camels back...but we have lots of evidence that this economic system is not benefitting the majority of the population,\u201c he said. \u201cAfrican Americans are dissatisfied with the way things are \u2014 that\u2019s not new for us\u2014 but now you find young college students dissatisfied with their future.\u201d See: Protesters support Floyd, Black Lives Matter on 3 continents The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the fact that African-Americans have a lack of income to buy necessary health care, food and medicine and are suffering in greater numbers than white Americans. Since the 1960s, the wealth gap has been largely ignored by the economics profession, black economists say. For years, black economists struggled in the American Economics Association to even study the subject of wealth disparity between the races, black economists said. Universities and think tanks also didn\u2019t support the work. Black economists formed their own association, the National Economics Association, in 1969 to study the economic situation of black Americans. \u201cIt was very difficult for a black economist to present a paper at an AEA conference that was questioning whether mainstream economists were understanding the economic disparity between the white and black community,\u201d Tauheed said. So called \u201cmainstream\u201d economists were really interested in more efficiency. \u201cThe wage gap is a question of equity or how to expand the pie,\u201d said Karl Boulware, an economics professor at Wesleyan University. \u201cThe best way to think of wealth is to think of it as power,\u201d he said. In a statement to her membership Friday, former Federal Reserve chairman Janet Yellen, who is the president of the AEA, said her organization has \u201conly begun to understand racism and its impact on our profession and our discipline.\u201d The wealth gap since 1989 The causes Black economists say one historical cause of the wage gap is slavery. \u201cI don\u2019t want to offend anybody, and don\u2019t want to be labeled a radical but the wealth gap has its roots in the starting of America,\u201d said Samuel Myers, an economist at the University of Minnesota. JIm Crow laws put in place shortly after the Civil War also kept black people impoverished. A more recent and complex cause was the systemic exclusion of black people from the U.S. housing market beginning in the 1920. Housing is one of the main engines of accumulating wealth in America. Restrictive covenants were put on houses that limited where black people could live, said Tauheed. These covenants, combined with discriminatory credit policies, kept black people from building wealth. At the same time, government policies were put in place to assist whites to build wealth through housing. For instance, in Minneapolis, where the current protests began after the death of George Floyd while being detained by police, white Americans first benefitted from the Homestead Act. Then white soldiers coming home from World War II were given cheap loans to buy homes in the surrounding suburbs. These neighborhoods were off limits to black people, said Myers. And the only prosperous black community in the city was razed to the ground to build a highway to St. Paul, he added. \u201cMy feeling is until and unless white people acknowledge that their wealth holdings and therefore the wealth gap is attributable to unearned entitlements from public policy, then we\u2019re not going to even have a conversation\u201d about solutions to the wealth gap, Professor Myers said.The solutions Black economists think that reparations \u2014 the direct payment to descendents of former slaves \u2014 would narrow the wealth gap. But they are under no illusion that this policy could be easily become law as blacks make up 12% of the population. Reparations \u201crun into conflict with the American mythology of how you get ahead, which says that it\u2019s all individual effort,\u201d said Professor Mason from Florida State. Sen. Cory Booker, the black U.S. Senator from New Jersey, pushed for \u201cbaby bonds\u201d during his brief run for the presidency last year. The accounts, presented at birth, would be seeded with $1,000 and receive up to $2,000 extra every year depending on family income. They could only be used once the child reached the age of 18, with the funds limited for paying college, a home, or to start a business. This idea is race-neutral and poor whites would benefit the most from such a program, Professor Myers noted. \u201cI don\u2019t really think in the final analysis baby bonds are going to dramatically narrow the wealth gap but I\u2019d be really happy if I\u2019m wrong,\u201d Myers said.
