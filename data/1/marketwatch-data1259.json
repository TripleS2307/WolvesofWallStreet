The Internal Revenue Service will be paying interest to taxpayers on refunds for returns that are filed between April 15 and July 15. This year, the deadline to file a return and pay taxes is Wednesday, July 15 instead of the traditional April 15. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a Treasury Department accommodation to help people with cash flow in the spring amid the coronavirus pandemic. Normally, interest on any refund doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t accrue until a return is filed, explained Edward Zollars of Thomas, Zollars & Lynch, certified public accountants in Phoenix, Ariz. Likewise, the IRS usually doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t start paying interest on refunds until 45 days from the return\u00e2\u0080\u0099s due date. But President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s emergency declaration in mid-March enabled the Treasury Department to set new filing deadlines for the year and \u00e2\u0080\u009cput the interest rules out the window,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Zollars explained. The special rules on interest are usually applied in the wake of natural disasters like a flood, he noted. People who received their refund before April 15 will not be getting any interest payments, he added. Interest on refunds filed by July 15 \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill generally be paid from April 15, 2020 until the date of the refund,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to an IRS announcement. The interest rate through June 30, the end of the second quarter, is 5%, compounded daily. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 3% during the third quarter, which starts July 1 and ends September 30. \u00e2\u0080\u009cInterest payments may be received separately from the refund,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the announcement said. The IRS did not immediately respond to a request for comment on more clarification about how it will pay the interest to taxpayers. As of July 3, the IRS had received 2.9 million fewer returns than it had at the same point last year. The tax collector had also processed 13.7 million fewer returns, which is a necessary step before it can issue a refund. The average refund was $2,762, according to IRS statistics. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss:The July 15 tax deadline is almost here \u00e2\u0080\u0094 here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one good reason NOT to worry People shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be expecting a windall in these interest payments, Zollars said. Supposing a taxpayer received the average $2,763 refund on June 30, he or she would receive an extra $28.63, according to Zollars\u00e2\u0080\u0099 calculation. A taxpayer receiving that refund on July 15 would get $32, Zollars said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese people will not be able to go on a vacation on this money. You might get a latte,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. The IRS considers the money as taxable interest income, Zollars noted."}]}
