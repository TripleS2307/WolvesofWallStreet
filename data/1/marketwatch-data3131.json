Andrew Cuomo announced Thursday. Residents in Central New York, the Finger Lakes, the Mohawk Valley, the North Country and the Southern Tier will be able to dine inside restaurants and visit personal care businesses, such as spas, nail salons and tattoo studios, starting Friday. Mandatory restrictions, including rules on maximum capacity \u2014 capped at 50%, social distancing, hygiene and personal protective equipment are in place for both industries, alongside suggested best practices. \u201cI know businesses are anxious to open. Everybody\u2019s anxious to get the economy going,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cPlease follow the guidelines and do what is permissible to do.\u201d \u201cShort-term gain isn\u2019t worth long-term pain,\u201d he said, and businesses not complying with the state\u2019s guidelines could lose their licenses or right to operate. As of Thursday, local governments statewide now have the authority to decide whether their swimming pools and playgrounds can reopen but should exercise caution when making the decision, according to Cuomo. \u201cThey have to use their judgment here,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cThey have the test data, they should be studying the test data. They should be looking at those positives and seeing where those positives are coming from.\u201d In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio \u2014 who had previously said public pools would be closed throughout this summer \u2014 will be reassessing his decision, given the progress made against the virus. \u201cNow we can start a conversation around pools,\u201d he said Tuesday, before the governor\u2019s announcement. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll get there, but at least we can at least begin that conversation now for the first time.\u201d On reopening playgrounds, \u201cthe day is coming, it\u2019s not here yet,\u201d the mayor said on Thursday. New York City is just four days into its first phase of reopening.

Also on MarketWatch: Coronavirus Economic Recovery Tracker \u201cThe numbers are good. Everything we\u2019ve done has been exactly right up until now, but that\u2019s up until now,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cYou can make a mistake today that wipes out everything we\u2019ve done, so we have to stay smart. This Covid has not gone away.\u201d Though still present, metrics show that currently, the spread and impact of the pandemic has undoubtedly improved. \u201cIt\u2019s overall great news again,\u201d Cuomo said, pointing toward declines in the number of people being hospitalized for coronavirus and a close-to-record low in the daily number of deaths. On Wednesday, 36 New Yorkers died as a result of coronavirus. That figure peaked in April, when the state recorded 799 fatalities in a single day. \u201cWhen you get this low on the number of deaths, I don\u2019t know what it is really telling us anymore,\u201d Cuomo said, adding that many of the people could have had comorbidities.

The state conducts roughly 50,000 tests a day, the governor said. On Wednesday, infection rates were highest in New York City at 1.7%, and lowest in the North Country at 0.3%. \u201cWatch those daily numbers,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cYou want to watch. You want to notice any trend line. You want to notice any bounce, and then you want to find out why.\u201d Additional New York Developments Thursday: Restaurants: Mayor Bill de Blasio and first lady Chirlane McCray have announced a Restaurant Revitalization Program in New York City.
