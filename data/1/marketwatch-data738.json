Dodge Let\u2019s take a closer look at the differences and similarities between the Challenger and the Camaro and see which one is right for you.Exterior Both of these cars have their own distinct personalities that are shown off with their unique exterior designs. The Challenger has a more retro look, with an aesthetic that is a clear throwback to the Challenger of the early 1970s, but with a modern twist.

The Camaro is a smaller, lighter car, which contributes to its excellent agility, but the larger size of the Challenger gives it some benefits that we\u2019ll get into shortly.

The Camaro has four seats, and the back seats are extremely cramped. The Challenger, however, seats up to five with a bench back seat with significantly more legroom than the Camaro. If you want a muscle car and you\u2019re planning on actually using the back seats occasionally, your passengers would greatly appreciate the Dodge over the Chevy. The Challenger also has a much bigger trunk than the Camaro.Mechanicals The Camaro and the Challenger both have four engines available. They also both come standard with rear-wheel drive, and the Challenger is available with all-wheel drive, but only with the base V6 engine. 2020 Dodge Challenger Engines 3.6-liter V6 making 305 horsepower and 268 lb-ft of torque; 19 miles per gallon in the city/30 mpg hwy 5.7-liter V8 making 375 hp and 410 lb-ft of torque; 16 mpg city/25 mpg hwy 6.4-liter V8 making 485 hp and 475 lb-ft of torque; 15 mpg city/24 mpg hwy 6.2-liter supercharged V8 making 717 hp and 656 lb-ft of torque (SRT Hellcat); 797 hp and 707 lb-ft of torque (SRT Hellcat Redeye); 13 mpg city/22 mpg hwy 2020 Chevrolet Camaro Engines 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-four making 275 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque; 22 mpg city/31 mpg hwy 3.6-liter V6 making 335 hp and 284 lb-ft of torque; 19 mpg city/29 mpg hwy 6.2-liter V8 making 455 hp and 455 lb-ft of torque; 16 mpg city/27 mpg hwy 6.2-liter supercharged V8 making 650 hp and 650 lb-ft of torque; 14 mpg city/20 mpg hwy The base turbocharged 4-cylinder in the Camaro is more efficient than the base V6 in the Challenger while offering less horsepower and more torque.

Here are 6 under $45,000 The 6.2-liter V8 in the Camaro SS is a better engine than the 5.7-liter Hemi V8 in the Challenger R/T. The Challenger offers a bigger 6.4-liter V8, which is a fantastic engine, but if you really want to get serious about performance and money is no object, then upgrading to the supercharged Hellcat or Hellcat Redeye is a must. The supercharged V8 in the Camaro ZL1 is outstanding and incredibly powerful, but it still doesn\u2019t match what Dodge offers on the top end.Technology Both of these cars benefit from pretty user-friendly infotainment systems. They both come standard with a 7-in unit, and they\u2019re both upgradable to a slightly bigger screen with more features. They both come standard with Android Auto and Apple AAPL, +1.74% CarPlay, but the Camaro has a standard 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot which can\u2019t be had in the Challenger.

Both cars have a lot of variety in their respective model ranges, which means there\u2019s a Challenger and a Camaro for every taste and every budget.Conclusion Which muscle car is right for you depends on your priorities. If you value sharp handling on the track over muscular, straight-line performance, then you\u2019ll prefer the Camaro over the Challenger. However, if the drag racer in you craves big power in a big car and you want the added practicality of usable back seats, a bigger trunk and available AWD, then the Challenger is the better choice.
