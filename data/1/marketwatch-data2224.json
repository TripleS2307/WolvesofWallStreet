John Lewis to lie in state at the U.S. Capitol. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel, R-Ky., announced late Thursday that Lewis's body will lie in state at the Capitol for public viewing Monday and Tuesday. Lewis, an icon of the civil-rights era and a 17-term congressman from Georgia, died July 17. An arrival ceremony for Lewis's body will be held at 1:30 p.m. Eastern. That could conflict with the hearing, scheduled to begin at noon, in which Apple Inc.'s AAPL, +1.74%  Tim Cook, Amazon.com Inc.'s AMZN, +3.01%  Jeff Bezos, Facebook Inc.'s FB, +0.26%  Mark Zuckerberg and Alphabet Inc.'s GOOGL, +1.82%  GOOG, +1.97%  Sundar Pichai are to appear via videoconference before the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee. Lawmakers are expected to grill them over their business practices and outsized influence their companies have on the U.S. economy and day-to-day life. A source familiar with the matter said it was highly likely that the hearing will need to be rescheduled. Axios reported Thursday night that lawmakers are tentatively looking to reschedule the hearing for the week of Aug. 3."}]}
