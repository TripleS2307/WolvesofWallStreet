The U.S. central bank signaled it plans to keep a key U.S. short-term interest rate near zero at least through the end of 2023 to help the economy recover from the coronavirus. The Fed\u2019s forecasts for 2023, released for the first time, also show the rate staying near zero from now until at least 2024. Read:The Fed is \u2018fighting the last battle,\u2019 and here are the risks to its new strategy The Fed \u201cconfirmed that it\u2019s not even thinking about thinking about raising rates, with its projections of zeroed interest rates for at least the next four years,\u201d said Brien Lundin, editor of Gold Newsletter. \u201cMoreover, it\u2019s made its goal of higher-than-2% inflation official by including it in is post-meeting policy statement.\u201d That \u201call adds up to official recognition that real, inflation-adjusted interest rates above zero are not only undesirable, but impossible given the size of the federal debt and its growth trajectory,\u201d he told MarketWatch. \u201cThis amounts to an extremely favorable backdrop for gold for years to come.\u201d Shortly after the Fed decision, December gold GCZ20, +2.17% GC00, +2.17% was at $1,974.10 an ounce in electronic trading. It had settled with a gain of $4.30, or 0.2%, at $1,970.50 an ounce, with most-active contract prices again ending at their highest Sept. 1, according to FactSet data. The FOMC announcement \u201cgiving off an even more dovish signal is going to help gold break out of this consolidation phase it has been in for the past several weeks,\u201d Peter Spina, president and chief executive officer at GoldSeek.com, told MarketWatch. \u201cIt may take some weeks still with some price consolidation finishing up here, but I expect gold to break back above $2,000\u201d in the fourth quarter and set fresh record highs as we close out the year. Prices for gold initially fell, then moved up during Wednesday\u2019s regular session in the wake of U.S. retail sales data, which revealed a rise of 0.6% in August for a third month in a row, but momentum appears to be waning after a burst of demand earlier in the summer once the country opened for business. Overall, \u201cgold has flat-lined since early August\u2019s peak because the other trends driving it higher have come off the boil,\u201d said Adrian Ash, director of research at BullionVault, pointing out that prices are currently right in the middle of the last four weeks\u2019 range. \u201cBond yields after inflation are holding around -1% on the 10-year, the dollar has steadied from its drop, and so [exchange-traded fun] inflows have dried up from investors wanting to protect their capital with gold.\u201d \u201cAs things stand at these levels, those three factors are supportive for gold, but it\u2019s the direction of travel that really matters,\u201d he told MarketWatch. \u201cAnother drop in the dollar, plus new lows in real rates, will very likely spur bullion and ETF demand,\u201d which should help gold break out of its holding pattern.\u201d Meanwhile, December silver SIZ20, +5.96% SI00, +5.96% rose a penny, or 0.04%, to end the day at $27.476 an ounce, following a 0.4% climb in the previous session. Previously, \u201cthe industrial part of silver was headwind, but now China has seen improved retail sales and a global \u201creopening of economy\u201d and the return of industrial demand are a \u201cgame-changer,\u201d said Gero. Also on Comex, December copper HGZ20, +1.38% shed 0.07% to $3.061 a pound. October platinum PLV20, +3.99% lost 0.9% to $973.50 an ounce, but December palladium PAZ20, +2.31% inched up by 0.1% to $2,417.60 an ounce, holding ground at the highest most-active contract prices since March. \u201cWe suspect that positive economic psychology, higher global equities and positive Chinese economic data will be required daily for [palladium] prices to continue to rise and regain the $2,500 level,\u201d analysts at Zaner Metals said in daily commentary."}]}
