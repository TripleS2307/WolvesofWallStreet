The International Energy Agency said that while the world\u2019s demand for crude will drop by 8.1 million barrels a day in 2020, \u201cthe largest in history,\u201d demand in 2021 will bounce back by 5.7 million barrels a day, the \u201clargest one-year jump ever recorded.\u201d \u201cDemand destruction in the early part of the year was slightly less than expected, although still unprecedented,\u201d the IEA said. The Paris-based agency also warned that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global economies should not be underestimated. \u201cWe acknowledge that there are places where the number of new Covid-19 cases reported each day remains high and economic activity, and thus oil demand, could remain subdued for longer than elsewhere,\u201d it said. Against the backdrop, West Texas Intermediate crude for July delivery CL.1, -1.62% US:CLN20, the U.S. benchmark, rose $1.26, or 3.4%, to settle at $38.38 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after hitting highs above $39 during the session. Prices rose 2.4% on Monday. Global benchmark Brent oil for August delivery UK:BRNQ20 picked up $1.24, or 3.1%, at $40.96 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe after gaining 2.6% in the previous session. A monthly report from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is due Wednesday, after the cartel and its allies, in a group known as OPEC+, agreed earlier this month to extend production cuts of nearly 10 million barrels per day through July and to review the status of adherence to those reductions monthly. However, output in the U.S., which isn\u2019t a signatory to the OPEC+ agreement, has shown signs of further declines, with the Energy Information Administration on Monday forecasting a July decline of 93,000 barrels per day in oil production from seven major U.S. shale plays. Meanwhile, an OPEC-led meeting of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee, or JMMC, to review compliance with the recent global production cuts will be held this week. \u201cEyes are on another coming meeting as well,\u201d wrote Bjornar Tonhaugen, head of oil markets at Rystad Energy, in a daily research note. \u201cThursday\u2019s production cut compliance committee meeting isn\u2019t one to miss. It may not be taking any decision on production cuts, but it will be very indicative of the mood within OPEC+,\u201d he wrote. On the bearish side for oil, \u201cconcerns about a second wave of COVID-19 cases in a number of U.S. states, as well as a recent uptick in the Chinese capital of Beijing are sure to gain the market\u2019s attention over at least the near-term,\u201d said Robbie Fraser, senior commodity analyst at Schneider Electric, in a daily note. \u201cThe market rally for much of May and early June was at least partially tied to stabilizing demand prospects and rebounds off record lows, which could be challenged by another significant wave of confirmed cases,\u201d he said. Weekly data on U.S. petroleum supplies will be released by the American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday, with official figures from the EIA due out Wednesday morning. On average, analysts at S&P Global Platts expect the EIA to report a decline of 3.5 million barrels in U.S. crude supplies for the week ended June 12. They also forecast an inventory decline of 2.2 million barrels for gasoline, but distillates, which include heating oil and diesel, are seen higher by 3.1 million barrels. On Nymex, July gasoline US:RBN20 tacked on 3.6% to $1.2073 a gallon and July heating US:HON20 rose 4% to $1.1822 a gallon. July natural gas settled at $1.614 per million British thermal units, down 3.3%. Read:Why natural-gas prices haven\u2019t yet bottomed despite this year\u2019s 20% drop"}]}
