I am in my early 30s, and my partner is in her late 20s. We do well for ourselves, we travel, we aren\u2019t struggling. I own a nice home in a town a few hours away that I rent out because I recently moved to the city. We are renting in the city now to save money. We have a roommate, and I feel that some friends judge us for this. Our friends are successful and all around our age. They are building extravagant homes, making what I believe to be more money than us, and I can\u2019t help but be green with envy and always comparing what they have to what we don\u2019t. Dispatches from a pandemic: Letter from New York: \u2018New Yorkers wear colorful homemade masks, while nurses wear garbage bags\u2019 I hate that my friends still get help from their parents and were born into money. They have no student-loan debt, one friend is a lawyer and her parents paid for that degree. One couple got their land for their home paid off by their family. I have had to work hard for everything I have in life, as well as my partner, and it\u2019s just hard seeing them get ahead while we feel like we\u2019re stagnant. I want to be happy for them and stop comparing. How can I do this? Feeling Green Dear Green, Your feelings about your friends are as real as your feeling that they\u2019re judging you for having a roommate. They are as real as you believe them to be. While you reflect upon your own relatively modest circumstances, I would bet that your lodger is the last thing on their minds. We all belong to infinitesimally small social groups: our family, friends, coworkers, neighbors, school friends and/or college alumni. Regaining perspective on your life and your finances is sometimes a more difficult task than it sounds. Do we look beyond our neighborhood, social group, country or need to fly to the moon? It\u2019s better to look inward than beyond the garden gate. The Green-Eyed Monster likely resides somewhere in your past. On an intellectual level, you know that this has zero to do with how you feel about your friends: You clearly wish them well. Nor does it have anything to do with how they feel about you: They likely admire you for reasons you have never considered. This has everything to do with how you feel about yourself. \u201c Regaining perspective on your life is sometimes a more difficult task than it sounds. Do we look beyond our neighborhood, social group, country or need to fly to the moon? \u201d Each one of these groups can make us feel \u201chigh status\u201d or \u201clow status.\u201d That\u2019s an exercise I learned as a kid in drama school. We\u2019d each take turns being the snooty shopkeeper and nervous customer. But this scenario plays out in real life, too. Here\u2019s the weird part: We can read about Hollywood actors or people who have valiantly survived some terrible calamity, and feel curiously numb. Movie stars may have a $20 million Beverly Hills home, but they make up a constellation of Greek gods, right? We are merely orbiting their firmament. Why on earth would we or they feel wanton? Surely, they don\u2019t have real problems. And people who earn less in a month than some Americans do in an hour ? They\u2019re a world away from our experiences, aren\u2019t they? Don\u2019t miss:\u2018We will not have a vaccine by next winter.\u2019 Like the 1918 Spanish flu, CDC says second wave of coronavirus could be worse. So what happens now? The more we have, the more we feel like we don\u2019t have enough. And we\u2019re all chasing something. That\u2019s why they call it a rat race. Rats are not the most delicate of creatures, but they sure know how to run. \u201cOur sense of an appropriate limit to anything \u2014 for example, to wealth and esteem \u2014 is never decided independently,\u201d the philosopher Alain de Botton writes in his book \u201cStatus Anxiety.\u201d That treatise chops, dices and vacuum packs the age-old malady of consumerism, and how we all compare ourselves to others. \u201cIt is decided by comparing our condition with that of a reference group, with that of people we consider to be our equals. We cannot appreciate what we have in isolation, nor judged against the lives of our medieval forbearers,\u201d Botton adds. \u201c This status consciousness starts with our siblings getting a bigger dollop of ice cream or the largest dinner plate, and ends up with us grumbling about the annex on our neighbor\u2019s house. \u201d \u201cIf we have a pleasant home and comfortable job, however, but learn through ill-advised attendance at a school reunion that some of our old friends (there is no stronger reference group) are now living in houses larger than our own, bought on the proceeds of more enticing occupations, we are likely to return home nursing a violent sense of misfortune,\u201d he writes. \u201cIt is the feeling that we might be something other than what we are \u2014 a feeling transmitted by the superior achievements of those we take to be our equals \u2014 that generates anxiety and resentment,\u201d he adds. \u201cIf we are small and live among people who are all of own height, we will not be unduly troubled by questions of size.\u201d What do I do to right-size myself? When I lived in London in my 20s, I visited the National Portrait Gallery when I was feeling blue. I would gaze at people who lived hundreds of years ago: Peasants, royalty, aristocrats or, perhaps, a portrait of a young man sitting wistfully in a window contemplating nothing but the day. It always put my own trials and tribulations in perspective. I felt grateful to have leisure time that a textile worker during the Industrial Revolution could only dream of. Time is the most valuable commodity we have. It\u2019s a brutal wake-up call, and a useful reminder that this \u201ccompare and despair\u201d does not always change along with our improved circumstances. This status consciousness starts with our siblings getting a bigger dollop of ice cream or the largest dinner plate, and ends up with us grumbling about the annex on our neighbor\u2019s house. Call up one of your wealthy friends, and ask them how they\u2019re doing. And then call up another friend who has far less than you. You may be surprised to discover that they have a lot in common.
