Well, my retirement income is $16,600 per year. Is there a place I can go where the sky is blue and the water warm? Where can an average person like me retire? R.S.R. Dear R.S.R., I hear you \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s frustrating to read about people who get to live large in retirement when your reality (and frankly, most Americans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 reality) is very different. The average Social Security retirement benefit in 2019 was $1,470 a month or $17,640 a year, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Even with benefits of that size, though, there are options for a beachy retirement. Here are affordable spots at the beach for you to consider. On the beach in Gulfport, Miss. iStock If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to stay in the U.S.: Gulfport, Miss. (with some part-time work) I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to sugarcoat this: It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tough to live in the U.S. on $16,600 a year, especially in a beach town. That said, if you can supplement your life with some part-time work, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doable. One town for you to consider: Gulfport, Miss., which is one of the most affordable beach towns in the country. The cost of living is nearly 19% lower than the U.S. average, according to Sperling\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Best Places, and you can find small apartments to rent for under $600 a month. Plus, Mississippi is tax friendly to retirees, with SmartAsset noting that \u00e2\u0080\u009cMississippi exempts all forms of retirement income from taxation, including Social Security benefits, income from an IRA, income from a 401(k) and any pension income. Gulfport offers warm weather and nice beaches \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and other perks, too. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis city is having a serious comeback moment \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bounty of cool, hip new businesses,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Vogue writes of Gulfport. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne gem in particular is Fishbone Alley: a funky destination that backs up to a handful of restaurants and bars, boasting original local art along the buildings.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The downsides include muggy, hot summers and the risk of hurricanes. Mazatl\u00c3\u00a1n, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re willing to live abroad. iStock If you want to stay close to the U.S.: Mazatl\u00c3\u00a1n, Mexico Heading south of the border can help you stretch your funds more effectively than is generally possible in the U.S. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be far from the only American there. Indeed, as I reported last year, plenty of people receive their U.S. Social Security checks in Mexico (behind only two countries, Canada and Japan). Of course, certain parts of Mexico have downsides including hot summers and high crime. But, as I wrote in this recent column for a woman looking to retire near the ocean on between $800 and $1,000 a month, there are some places that fit within your budget. I suggested she consider Mazatl\u00c3\u00a1n \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a Pacific coastal resort town with \u00e2\u0080\u009ccobblestone streets, neoclassical and French Baroque architecture and cultural amenities like theater and art galleries.\u00e2\u0080\u009d (We also talked to a woman who retired to Mazatl\u00c3\u00a1n on $1,000 a month, and she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pinching pennies too much.) Note that Mazatl\u00c3\u00a1n itself is in the state of Sinaloa, which the U.S. government advises Americans against traveling to, though this exempts parts of Mazatl\u00c3\u00a1n, as we have reported. One hiccup: There are monetary requirements for Mexican residency that you may not currently meet, as they stipulate a certain monthly pension income or a minimum value held in investments (these numbers change with the exchange rate and other factors, but you can read up on that here.) Thus, if all your $16,600 will come from Social Security and you have no savings and investments, retirement there might be a problem; if, however, you have a larger investment account to draw from, it can work. How these Americans save money in retirement: They live in Spain Coastal Panama. iStock If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re up for an adventure: Pedasi, Panama This chilled-out town on the Pacific Ocean, roughly 4\u00c2\u00bd hours from Panama City, is \u00e2\u0080\u009cunpretentious and laid-back,\u00e2\u0080\u009d writes Lonely Planet, adding: \u00e2\u0080\u009cPedasi has streets lined with tiled colonials and leafy spaces. For years this sleepy retreat came to life only at festival times. But outsiders are discovering the big appeal of small-town life and relatively unspoiled beaches.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To be sure, this town is small, with fewer than 5,000 residents, and rural, but as International Living puts it, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPedasi is rural living at its best.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surrounded by green pastures and grazing cattle yet lies within a 10-minute drive of the ocean, according to International Living, which adds that \u00e2\u0080\u009cmiles of unspoiled beach and little development\u00e2\u0080\u009d are found locally. You can also live here on your budget, though it may, as International Living notes, require \u00e2\u0080\u009cboots-on-the-ground investigating with the locals\u00e2\u0080\u009d or moving a bit farther from the ocean to get a better deal on rent. (Though, they point out, paying $500 a month for an apartment is doable.) Even if you pay a bit more in rent, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll benefit from Panama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pensionado program for retirees (which has income requirements of roughly $1,000 a month) as it offers tons of discounts for older people on everything from entertainment to prescriptions.
