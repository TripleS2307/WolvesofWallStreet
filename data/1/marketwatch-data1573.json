Sunday (on the CNN program \u201cState of the Union\u201d): Trade adviser Peter Navarro says Trump was engaging in a \u201clighthearted moment\u201d at the rally when he, in a \u201ctongue-in-cheek\u201d manner, spoke of slowing down testing. (The same day, CBS cites another, anonymous White House official as calling Trump\u2019s testing comment \u201cin jest.\u201d) Monday (at the White House): Press secretary Kayleigh McEnany appears to confirm Navarro\u2019s explanation of the Trump remark, saying it had been delivered \u201cin jest.\u201d (Meanwhile, Vice President Mike Pence is quoted by ABC and others as having told governors that Trump\u2019s comment was \u201cin passing.\u201d) Tuesday (outside the White House): Trump appears to reveal as artifice the narrative pushed by McEnany, Navarro and company, telling reporters as he departed for a trip to Arizona: \u201c \u2018I don\u2019t kid. Let me just tell you. Let me make it clear.\u2019 \u201d Responded presumptive Democratic opponent Joe Biden, on Twitter: \u201c \u2018It\u2019s pretty simple: If we want to save people\u2019s jobs and save people\u2019s lives, we need more testing \u2014 and we need it faster. The President is intentionally slowing it down.\u2019 \u201d In testimony before a House panel on Tuesday, though, Dr. Anthony Fauci suggested neither he nor other members of the White House coronavirus task force have received a slowdown order from Trump. \u201cWe will be doing more testing,\u201d Fauci said."}]}
