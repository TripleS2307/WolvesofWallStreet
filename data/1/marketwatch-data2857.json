IBM IBM, -2.81% reported second-quarter net income of $1.36 billion, or $1.52 a share, compared with $2.5 billion, or $2.81 a share, in the year-ago period.

IBM had reported a decline in revenue in April, returning Big Blue to a losing streak it briefly snapped when it managed to eke out a slight rise in sales in the fourth quarter. IBM\u2019s sales have declined year-over-year in all but four of the past 32 quarters. Cloud and cognitive software sales, which includes IBM\u2019s Red Hat business, came in at $5.75 billion, compared with $5.65 billion in the year-ago quarter, while analysts had forecast $5.74 billion. \u201cOnly 20% of the workloads have moved to the cloud,\u201d said Arvind Krishna, IBM\u2019s chief executive, on a conference call. \u201cThe other 80% are mission-critical workloads that are far more difficult to move. There is a massive opportunity in front of us to capture these workloads.\u201d IBM shares jumped more than 5% in after-hours activity and were last up 4.3%, after gaining 1% to close the regular session at $126.37. For the year, IBM shares are down 5.7%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% \u2014 which counts IBM as a component \u2014 is off 6.5%, the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% is up less than 1%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.39% is up 20%.

Back in April, IBM pulled its full-year guidance of \u201cat least $13.35\u201d a share, and said it would revisit whether it would provide guidance at the end of the second quarter. On Monday\u2019s call, the company said it is still withholding guidance for the year. \u201cIt\u2019s likely that we see that the economic recovery is looking to be longer and more protracted than we might have hoped for back in March,\u201d Krishna said on the call. \u201cWe have a lot of uncertainty in the economic environment around the globe, and when we look at it by geography, by continent, or by industry, there is just so much variability that we can\u2019t answer it,\u201d Krishna said. Of the 18 analysts who cover IBM, three have overweight or buy ratings, 13 have hold ratings, and two have sell ratings, along with an average price target of $126.60."}]}
