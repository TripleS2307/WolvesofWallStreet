Wade Crowfoot, California\u00e2\u0080\u0099s secretary for natural resources, told the president during a briefing on the fires that state officials \u00e2\u0080\u009cwant to work with you to really recognize the changing climate and what it means to our forests,\u00e2\u0080\u009d spurring Trump to say: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll start getting cooler. You just watch.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Crowfoot said he wished science agreed with that view, and Trump then said he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think \u00e2\u0080\u009cscience knows actually.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The fires were key parts of both Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s days, with Biden delivering a speech in Delaware on the wildfires in which he attacked Trump, saying four more years of his \u00e2\u0080\u009cclimate denial\u00e2\u0080\u009d could mean more burned suburbs.

More than 3.3 million acres have burned in California so far this year, and, since mid-August, 4,000 structures have been destroyed, the Journal reported, citing Cal Fire. Opinion:7 ways you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already paying for climate change The Democratic governors of California, Oregon and Washington say the fires are a consequence of climate change, while the Trump administration has blamed poor forest management for the flames that have raced through the region and made the air in places like Portland, Oregon, Seattle and San Francisco some of the worst in the world. Trump on Monday said he and California Gov. Gavin Newsom \u00e2\u0080\u009ccome from different sides of the planet, but we actually have a good relationship.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The president also took part in a ceremony honoring seven helicopter crew members from the California Army National Guard who rescued campers trapped by a massive fire, saying they \u00e2\u0080\u009csaved the lives of an astounding 242 people.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Oregon Gov. Kate Brown said Sunday that more than 40,000 residents of her state had evacuated as dozens of fires have burned more than 1 million acres. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is truly the bellwether for climate change on the West Coast, and this is a wake-up call for all of us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said on CBS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cFace the Nation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump later Monday was due to take part in a campaign event in the swing state of Arizona before flying back to Washington, D.C. With 50 days to go before the Nov. 3 election, Biden has an edge of 3.7 percentage points over the Republican incumbent in a RealClearPolitics moving average of polls focused on top swing states that are likely to decide the White House race.
