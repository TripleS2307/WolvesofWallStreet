The budget airline said that it expects demand to drop due to travel restrictions and quarantine measures bought about by the coronavirus pandemic. It added that customer travel plans have been hit by evolving government restrictions across Europe and quarantine measures in the U.K., including Monday's announcements that removed seven Greek islands from the exemption list. easyJet said that it continues to review its liquidity position on a regular basis and assess any further funding requirements. It also said that due to the current restrictions and uncertainty it wouldn't be appropriate to maintain financial guidance for this year or next. \"We again call on the Government to provide sector specific support for aviation which needs to take the form of a broad package of measures including the removal of APD [air passenger duty] for at least 12 months, the alleviation of ATC [air traffic control] charges along with continuation of the slot rule waiver,\" Chief Executive Johan Lundgren said.
