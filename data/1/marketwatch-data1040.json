Speaking Sunday night to CNN\u2019s Elizabeth Cohen as part of the Aspen Ideas Festival, Fauci said he would \u201csettle\u201d for a coronavirus vaccine that is 70% to 75% effective. By comparison, a measles vaccine is 97% to 98% effective. \u201cThat would be wonderful if we get there,\u201d Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious disease expert, said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we will. I would settle for a 70, 75% effective vaccine.\u201d Fauci said he remains confident a vaccine will be developed. A number of promising drugs are in development, and it is hoped a vaccine can be distributed as soon as the end of the year, though officials warn that is likely an overly optimistic view.

Herd immunity is only achieved once \u201ca sufficient proportion of a population is immune to an infectious disease (through vaccination and/or prior illness) to make its spread from person to person unlikely,\u201d according to the CDC.
