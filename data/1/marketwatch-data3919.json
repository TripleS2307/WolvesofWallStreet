Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager commented in the release that Google's acquisition of Fitbit could give the ad giant \"key insights about the life and the health situation of the users of these devices,\" so this investigation \"aims to ensure that control by Google over data collected through wearable devices as a result of the transaction does not distort competition.\" A Reuters report from mid-July said that Google had offered not to use Fitbit health data for the purposes of ad targeting given European Commission concerns. The commission has 90 working days, or until Dec. 9, to reach a decision. Fitbit shares are down 0.4% in Tuesday trading, while Alphabet shares are up 0.3%. Fitbit shares have lost 1.8% so far this year as Alphabet's stock has gained 11% and as the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% has risen 2%."}]}
