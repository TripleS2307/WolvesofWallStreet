That includes attaching a price to carbon. In a release Wednesday, Business Roundtable members are calling on the private and public sectors to work together to limit the global temperature rise this century to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, consistent with the goals of the multi-country Paris Agreement. In the U.S., this means reducing net-greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% by 2050 as compared to 2005 levels. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an attitude shift that has evolved in the decade or so since Congress tried to advance comprehensive climate-change legislation and the last time the Roundtable issued guiding principles on climate in 2007, although some individual corporations have pushed ahead with their own plans for promoting renewable energy use or limiting pollution. Trump pulled the U.S. from the Paris deal primarily citing non-compliance from big emitters China, India and Brazil. The Business Rountable is also in support of placing a federal price on carbon \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhere feasible and effective.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A unified carbon market has had trouble getting off the ground in the U.S. and was largely relegated to regional cap-and-trade markets that have had hot-and-cold participation. A carbon price, a tax by some accounts, was also promoted recently in a Commodity Futures Trading Commission-led bipartisan report on ways to counter the devastating risks from climate change to the U.S. financial system. \u00e2\u0080\u009cClimate change is real, and we must act. Meeting the scope of this challenge will require collective global action \u00e2\u0080\u0093 business and government,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mary Barra, chairman and CEO of General Motors Co. GM, -0.15% \u00c2 , who backed the effort. The Business Roundtable includes chief executives from more than 200 companies responsible for more than 15 million employees and generating more than $7.5 trillion in combined annual revenues. Victoria Mills, managing director at the Environmental Defense Fund, said the emphasis placed on action from Congress by the private-sector roundtable was a key feature. She likened the position in Wednesday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s release to principles issued recently by a group called CEO Climate Dialogue, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich include putting a fair and economy-wide price on carbon and promoting equity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As expected, the Roundtable emphasized climate-change measures that will keep U.S. corporations competitive globally, encourage spending on technology that will promote energy innovation and avoiding \u00e2\u0080\u009cduplicative, inefficient or counterproductive federal and state regulations,\u00e2\u0080\u009d among other priorities. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are committed to leading by example,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ryan Lance, chairman and CEO of fossil-fuel giant ConocoPhillips, who emphasized regulatory simplification.

Andrew Steer, president and CEO of the World Resources Institute, was also receptive to the new push by the private sector, calling it \u00e2\u0080\u009cconsistent with recent research that finds enacting ambitious policies to decarbonize the economy is not only compatible with economic growth, but necessary for long-term growth and international competitiveness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn referencing the Paris Agreement, these CEOs are reinforcing the message that addressing climate change should follow a science-based and globally cooperative approach,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.
