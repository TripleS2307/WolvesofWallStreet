The S&P 500 notched a fresh record close on Tuesday, setting a new high-water mark for an index that tracks many of the nation\u2019s biggest corporations. Despite continuing concerns about the trajectory of the pandemic, the shape of the economic recovery and political turmoil in the U.S., it also marked the S&P 500\u2019s quickest turnaround from bear-market territory in history, according to Dow Jones Market Data. \u201cOur feeling is that a good deal of the easy lifting is behind us,\u201d said Michael Hans, chief investment officer at Clarfeld Citizens Private Wealth, after the S&P 500 also briefly carved out its first intraday record since Feb. 19. \u201cWe have a resilient consumer, and benchmarks are back to all-time highs,\u201d he told MarketWatch, but also added that it\u2019s unclear what improvements in consumer spending, the labor markets and economic activity can be sustained without ongoing monetary and fiscal support. \u201cThe expectation is that policy will not be in place forever,\u201d he said. Two of the nation\u2019s biggest retailers reported second-quarter results that beat expectations, giving stock benchmarks a temporary boost. Shares of Walmart Inc. WMT, +1.00% and Home Depot Inc. HD, +0.49% briefly surged to record territory, but closed lower. Many retailers have been leveled by business closures imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, although Home Depot and Walmart have found some support from consumers focusing on home-improvement projects and general shopping needs. Walmart sells about 25% of all groceries bought in the U.S. and its results have been boosted by its partnership with Instacart, an internet startup for grocery deliveries.

Increases in both single-family and multifamily starts contributed to the increase. Permitting activity occurred at a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 1.495 million, up 18.8% from June and 9.4% from July 2019. Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance, pointed to the \u201cmassive amounts of liquidity that the Federal Reserve has injected into the system\u201d as a catalyst for \u201cthe stunning recovery that we have just witnessed,\u201d in emailed commentary, that also warned of numerous headwinds, including high unemployment, that could drag on the market. As U.S. economic activity slowly recovers from the coronavirus crisis, investors have begun to point to \u201cpolitical disarray\u201d in America as a reason for the U.S. dollar\u2019s recent decline. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, in a CNBC interview, said the economy is doing better as more businesses reopen, but that President Donald Trump wants Congress to do more. \u201cHe wants us to provide money for kids and jobs, and a second round of the PPP and direct payments are a clear part of that,\u201d he said of the Treasury\u2019s hallmark Paycheck Protection Program to help small businesses cover payroll during the pandemic. Meanwhile, Senate Republicans were expected to soon introduce a \u201cskinny\u201d coronavirus relief plan that also includes $10 billion for the U.S. Postal Service, which now sits at the heart a controversy over mail-in voting for the general elections on Nov. 3, according to several news reports. It is unclear if the new proposal will help break an impasse between the two political parties after $600 a week in extra unemployment benefits expired at the end of July. The Republican proposal includes a $300-a-week enhanced unemployment benefit, money for small-business aid, and protection for employers against lawsuits stemming from COVID-19 infections, according to Bloomberg. Several Democratic state attorneys general also said Tuesday they plan to sue the Trump administration to thwart any changes to the U.S. Postal Service that could hamper mail-in voting for the upcoming election. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy pledged that the mail service is ready today to handle all of the mail-in ballots it receives in November.
