He was 65. A person close to Van Halen\u2019s family confirmed the rocker died Tuesday due to cancer. The person was not authorized to publicly release details in advance of an official announcement. With his distinct solos, Eddie Van Halen fueled the ultimate California party band and helped knock disco off the charts starting in the late 1970s with his band\u2019s self-titled debut album and then with the blockbuster record \u201c1984,\u201d which contains the classics \u201cJump,\u201d \u201cPanama\u201d and \u201cHot for Teacher.\u201d Van Halen is among the top 20 best-selling artists of all time, and the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2007. Rolling Stone magazine put Eddie Van Halen at No. 8 in its list of the 100 greatest guitarists. Eddie Van Halen was something of a musical contradiction. He was an autodidact who could play almost any instrument, but he couldn\u2019t read music. He was a classically trained pianist who also created some of the most distinctive guitar riffs in rock history. He was a Dutch immigrant who was considered one of the greatest American guitarists of his generation. \u201cYou changed our world. You were the Mozart of rock guitar. Travel safe rockstar,\u201d Motley Crue\u2019s Nikki Sixx said on Twitter. The members of Van Halen \u2014 the two Van Halen brothers, Eddie and Alex; vocalist David Lee Roth; and bassist Michael Anthony \u2014 formed in 1974 in Pasadena, California. They were members of rival high school bands and then attended Pasadena City College together. They combined to form the band Mammoth, but then changed to Van Halen after discovering there was another band called Mammoth. Their 1978 release \u201cVan Halen\u201d opened with a blistering \u201cRunnin\u2019 With the Devil\u201d and then Eddie Van Halen showed off his astonishing skills in the next song, \u201cEruption,\u201d a furious 1:42 minute guitar solo that swoops and soars like a deranged bird. The album also contained a cover of the Kinks\u2019 \u201cYou Really Got Me\u201d and \u201cAin\u2019t Talkin\u2019 \u2019Bout Love.\u201d Mike McCready of Pearl Jam told Rolling Stone magazine that listening to Van Halen\u2019s \u201cEruption\u201d was like hearing Mozart for the first time. \u201cHe gets sounds that aren\u2019t necessarily guitar sounds \u2014 a lot of harmonics, textures that happen just because of how he picks.\u201d Van Halen released albums on a yearly timetable \u2014 \u201cVan Halen II\u201d (1979), \u201cWomen and Children First\u201d (1980), \u201cFair Warning\u201d (1981) and \u201cDiver Down\u201d (1982) \u2014 until the monumental \u201c1984,\u201d which hit No. 2 on the Billboard 200 album charts (only behind Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cThriller\u201d). Rolling Stone ranked \u201c1984\u201d No. 81 on its list of the 100 Greatest Albums of the 1980s. \u201cEddie put the smile back in rock guitar, at a time when it was all getting a bit brooding. He also scared the hell out of a million guitarists around the world, because he was so damn good. And original,\u201d Joe Satriani, a fellow virtuoso, told Billboard in 2015. Van Halen also played guitar on one of the biggest singles of the 1980s: Jackson\u2019s \u201cBeat It.\u201d His solo lasted all of 20 seconds and took only a half an hour to record. He did it as a favor to producer Quincy Jones, while the rest of his Van Halen bandmates were out of town. Van Halen received no compensation or credit for the work, even though he rearranged the section he played on. \u201cIt was 20 minutes of my life. I didn\u2019t want anything for doing that,\u201d he told Billboard in 2015. \u201cI literally thought to myself, \u2018Who is possibly going to know if I play on this kid\u2019s record?\u2019\u201d Rolling Stone ranked \u201cBeat It\u201d No. 344 on its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. Jackson\u2019s melding of hard rock and R&B preceded the meeting of Run-DMC and Aerosmith by four years. But strains between Roth and the band erupted after their 1984 world tour and Roth left. The group then recruited Sammy Hagar as lead singer \u2014some critics called the new formulation \u201cVan Hagar\u201d \u2014 and the band went on to score its first No. 1 album with \u201c5150,\u201d More studio albums followed, including \u201cOU812,\u201d \u201cFor Unlawful Carnal Knowledge\u201d and \u201cBalance.\u201d Hit singles included \u201cWhy Can\u2019t This Be Love\u201d and \u201cWhen It\u2019s Love.\u201d Hagar was ousted in 1996 and former Extreme singer Gary Cherone stepped in for the album \u201cVan Halen III,\u201d a stumble that didn\u2019t lead to another album and the quick departure of Cherone. Roth would eventually return in 2007 and team up with the Van Halen brothers and Wolfgang Van Halen, Eddie\u2019s son, on bass for a tour, the album \u201cA Different Kind of Truth\u201d and the 2015 album \u201cTokyo Dome Live in Concert.\u201d Van Halen\u2019s music has appeared in films as varied as \u201cSuperbad,\u201d \u201cMinions\u201d and \u201cSing\u201d as well as TV shows like \u201cGlee\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.\u201d Video games such as \u201cGran Turismo 4\u201d and \u201cGuitar Hero\u201d have used his riffs. Their song \u201cJamie\u2019s Cryin\u201d was sampled by rapper Tone Loc in his hit \u201cWild Thing.\u201d For much of his career, Eddie Van Halen wrote and experimented with sounds while drunk or high or both. He revealed that he would stay in his hotel room drinking vodka and snorting cocaine while playing into a tape recorder. (Hagar\u2019s 2011 autobiography \u201cRed: My Uncensored Life in Rock\u201d portrays Eddie as a violent, booze-addled vampire, living inside a garbage-strewn house.) \u201cI didn\u2019t drink to party,\u201d Van Halen told Billboard. \u201cAlcohol and cocaine were private things to me. I would use them for work. The blow keeps you awake and the alcohol lowers your inhibitions. I\u2019m sure there were musical things I would not have attempted were I not in that mental state.\u201d Eddie Van Halen was born in Amsterdam and his family immigrated to California in 1962 when he was 7. His father was a big band clarinetist who rarely found work after coming to the U.S., and their mother was a maid who had dreams of her sons being classical pianists. The Van Halens shared a house with three other families. Eddie and Alex had only each other, a tight relationship that flowed through their music. \u201cWe showed up here with the equivalent of $50 and a piano,\u201d Eddie Van Halen told The Associated Press in 2015. \u201cWe came halfway around the world without money, without a set job, no place to live and couldn\u2019t even speak the language.\u201d He said his earliest memories of music were banging pots and pans together, marching to John Philip Sousa marches. At one point, Eddie got a drum set, which his older brother coveted. \u201cI never wanted to play guitar,\u201d he confessed at a talk at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of American History in 2015. But his brother was good at the drums, so Eddie gave into his brother\u2019s wishes: \u201cI said, \u2018Go ahead, take my drums. I\u2019ll play your damn guitar.\u2019\u201d He was a relentless experimenter who would solder different parts from different guitar-makers, including Gibson and Fender. He created his own graphic design for his guitars by adding tape to the instruments and then spray-painting them. He said his influences were Eric Clapton, and Jimi Hendrix. Van Halen, sober since 2008, lost one-third of his tongue to a cancer that eventually drifted into his esophagus. In 1999, he had a hip replacement. He was married twice, to actress Valerie Bertinelli from 1981 to 2007 and then to stuntwoman-turned-publicist Janie Liszewski, whom he wed in 2009."}]}
