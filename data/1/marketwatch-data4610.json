Chicago-based Conagra posted net income of $201.4 million, or 41 cents a share, in the quarter to May 31, up from $126.5 million, or 26 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Adjusted per-share earnings came to 75 cents, ahead of the 66 cents FactSet consensus. Sales rose to $3.289 billion from $2.613 billion, also ahead of the FactSet consensus of $3.153 billion. \"Our business clearly benefited from increased at-home eating in the fourth quarter, as the elevated retail demand outweighed the reduced foodservice demand,\" Chief Executive Sean Connolly said in a statement. \"In retail, many consumers tried our modernized products for the first time and then returned for more. While we are optimistic about the long-term implications of recent consumer behavior shifts, given COVID-19 uncertainties, we are only providing guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. We intend to provide an update on our fiscal 2021 outlook next quarter.\" The company is expecting first-quarter adjusted EPS of 54 cents to 59 cents, compared with a FactSet consensus of 54 cents. Shares have fallen 1.6% in the year through Monday, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% has fallen 6%."}]}
