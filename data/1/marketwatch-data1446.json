You may not like the answer", "body": "Wall Street investors and ordinary Americans have been waiting for Washington to legislate another round of stimulus to support the COVID-struck economy ever since the last one expired, in July. Most pundits were relatively hopeful, for a while. But in the past few weeks, a Congress that puts the \u201cpro\u201d in procrastination has started to alarm the market. But if Wall Street really wants to get Washington\u2019s attention, it may take a more serious move than the steady grind lower that we\u2019ve seen over the past few weeks, according to one analysis. \u201cOnly a 5% down day on the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% shows real investor concern that Washington needs to step up ASAP,\u201d said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, in a note out Tuesday. \u201c We haven\u2019t had that sort of move yet.\u201d Colas elaborated: \u201cAs rough as the recent selloff has been, we will not get really concerned about market sentiment until there is a down +5% day on the S&P 500. That\u2019s a 5 standard deviation move and signals real trouble ahead.\u201d There have been very few days with such a big drawdown in recent history, he noted. The 2008-2009 period, during and in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis, saw 12. There was one in August 2011, after the ratings agency Standard & Poor\u2019s downgraded the sovereign debt of the United States. And there have been five this year: four in March, when panic over the COVID crisis first burst to the surface, and one in June. The funny thing is, such a big market move may not only signal \u201creal trouble ahead.\u201d It may also persuade Washington to finally pay attention to whatever is causing the market turmoil. As Colas put it, \u201cthe March 2020 crash days were Wall Street\u2019s distress call to Washington asking for fiscal support, and it came quickly. \u201d Colas has been tracking the similarities between this year\u2019s market downturn and 2008, and thinks the earlier crisis provides a sort of playbook for navigating this year. In other words, if you\u2019ve been anticipating another \u201cTARP moment,\u201d a swoon in the markets after Congress fails to do the right thing, you might want to buckle up.
