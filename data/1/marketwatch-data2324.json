SLB, -1.21% said Tuesday that it has initiated \"major changes\" to its organizational structure, aimed at permanently removing over $1.5 billion in costs on an annual basis. The stock rose 2.4% in afternoon trading. The changes will result in $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion in cash costs from both restructuring moves and headcount reductions. Among the changes will be moving to four divisions from 17 product lines and structuring geographically around five key basins of activity. The company aims to position itself to extract more value from digital technologies, as working remotely has accelerated in the past 3 months and as operational headcount was reduced by 25%. \"Although we forewarned that Q2 will decline severely, the drop as been sharper than expected, due not only to the severe decline in North America land activity, but also due to the COVID-related disruptions in the international markets,\" Chief Executive Olivier Le Peuch said at the JP Morgan 2020 Energy, Power & Renewables Conference. The stock has tumbled 50.8% year to date, while the SPDR Energy Select Sector ETF XLE, -1.59% has dropped 31.7% and the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% has slipped 3.1%."}]}
