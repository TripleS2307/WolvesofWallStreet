Evans said that the Fed statement says the Fed expects to hold its policy rate close to zero until inflation gets to 2%. After that, the Fed can begin to raise rates but policy will still be accommodative as the Fed seeks to get inflation to average 2% over some time. The dollar rose as traders interpreted his comment as a signal of an earlier lift-off of zero than anticipated. Evans said he thinks markets should understand that a 2.5% inflation rate for some period of time \"is likely in the cards\" if the central bank is doing its job right."}]}
