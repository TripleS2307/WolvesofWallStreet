We all want to live healthier, happier, longer lives. But did you know there are three factors about where you live that can help make that happen? A study published in the July 2020 International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health found that when cities, neighborhoods and community organizations create healthy environments for area residents, the impact on the longevity of their residents can be huge. Four researchers at Washington State University (WSU) examined data on the deaths of Washingtonians aged 75 and older between 2011 and 2015. They found that many of the 2,698 people there who\u2019d been centenarians \u2014 1.8% of the sample \u2014 were clustered into a few geographic areas. That led the study authors to look for the environmental, or community, factors most highly associated with living to 100 and beyond.What the researchers found Three of the common factors were a high working-age population percentage, walkability and an area with a higher socioeconomic status, said Rajan Bhardwaj, one of the study\u2019s authors. Each of those factors can be directly impacted by public policy and city planning. And it seems that\u2019s what\u2019s going on in some centenarian hot spots. One of the standout locales in the study was Pullman, Wash., a hilly, midsize college town of around 35,000 in the southeast part of the state. \u201cOur public works director says it\u2019s the water!\u201d Pullman\u2019s mayor, Glenn Johnson, 76, joked. In reality, though, a number of other factors make Pullman an ideal town for healthy aging. Don\u2019t miss: How to get older without screwing it up \u201cWe\u2019ve always encouraged a wellness attitude. We\u2019re a \u2018Well City, \u2018which is a public health initiative in the state of Washington,\u201d Johnson explained. \u201cA lot of the businesses around town also have wellness programs.\u201d From an age diversity standpoint, Pullman is light years ahead of where it used to be.Making Pullman, Wash. a better place to grow older When Johnson came to teach at Washington State University, Pullman back in 1979, he said, \u201canyone who wanted to retire back then sort of left the area, because there wasn\u2019t anything to attract them or keep them here.\u201d Now, Johnson noted, \u201cwe\u2019ve got a senior center with all kinds of activities, there are three top-notch retirement communities or facilities in the area and WSU has a retiree\u2019s association. There are just a ton of amenities.\u201d Ron Wachter, 82, a local businessman who\u2019s lived in Pullman since 1963, agrees. \u201cThe golf course is world famous. We\u2019ve got world-class athletes competing at the college and we\u2019ve got the arts and music. I mean, where else can you get a better seat or better entertainment for less money? There\u2019s just a lot to do,\u201d said Wachter. Many of WSU Pullman\u2019s staff and faculty members now retire in Pullman only to start second careers locally, keeping them vibrant and active.How Durant, Okla., is trying to become a better place to age well But nearly 2,000 miles away, in Durant, Okla., residents aren\u2019t aging as well \u2014 yet. Life expectancy for residents in and around Durant is at, or slightly below, the national average of 78.6 years. Charla Hall, a professor of psychology at Southeastern Oklahoma State University and 22-year resident of Durant, gave some clues why: \u201cI know that our part of the state deals with diabetes, as an example. Our rates are quite high. And when I\u2019m out in the community, it\u2019s evident that a large percentage of the population struggles with weight. And I see a lot of people smoking; more than when I\u2019m out in other communities.\u201d But things in this college town of 18,000 are starting to change for the better, thanks to a community initiative and partnership with The Blue Zones Project, whose mission is to help people live healthier, longer lives through certain types of environmental design. \u201cWe\u2019ll model The Blue Zones\u2019 nine underlying denominators and try to replicate those,\u201d says Ashton Gabbart, the marketing and engagement lead for Blue Zones Project by Sharecare in Durant. \u201cThe long-term goal, obviously, is to create a sustainable impact for generations on into the future. We want to lower chronic disease and increase longevity. We\u2019ll measure results in the shorter term, but ultimately this will be a 20- or 30-year project.\u201d To produce those changes, Gabbart and other Blue Zones Project staffers will work with Durant\u2019s city government, business leaders, community development organizations and citizen volunteers to implement a specific and ambitious plan for the future health of Durant\u2019s residents. \u201cWe\u2019ll work with restaurants to try to get them to offer more fruits and vegetables, so that making the healthy option is the easy option,\u201d said Gabbart. \u201cTen of our top 20 worksites [in the area] will need to take the Blue Zones Pledge, creating healthier break rooms \u2014 like replacing soda with water or green teas; swapping donuts in the conference room with fresh fruit and scheduling more breaks throughout the day to get up and move naturally.\u201d Durant will also put in biking lanes and more sidewalks, which are lacking in some parts of the community. Also see: COVID-19 has dashed the retirement dreams of these people There will also be specific initiatives for older adults, such as creating volunteer opportunities around social engagement and healthy habits. If the pandemic allows, \u201cwe want to get our seniors volunteering at farmers markets, for example and we\u2019re looking at setting up a \u2018Walking School Bus\u2019 program, which would pair seniors and elementary school kids to walk to school together,\u201d said Gabbart. Durant is also stepping up to address the socioeconomic factor to help all people in the community live longer, healthier lives. \u201cWe want to make sure our lower-income residents have access to healthy food. So, one of the things we\u2019ve talked about is having mobile grocery stores. This addresses food deserts as well as transportation issues that lower-income folks might be facing,\u201d Gabbart said. Hall, who volunteers with the Blue Zones Project in Durant when she\u2019s not teaching, is excited for her hometown\u2019s future. \u201cOver the past several years, we\u2019ve been moving in the right direction. But with Blue Zones coming in, it offers a number of resources that we didn\u2019t have before and that\u2019s exciting.\u201d Rashelle Brown is a longtime fitness professional and freelance writer with hundreds of bylines in print and online.
