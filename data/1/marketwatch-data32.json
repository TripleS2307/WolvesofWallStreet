Washington politics continued to dominate the attention of traders who are still looking for Democratic and Republican lawmakers to strike an agreement on a new coronavirus aid relief package despite intermittent negotiations since August. The White House said it was open to a broader stimulus package only days after President Donald Trump said he was willing to do standalone fiscal measures only. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, however, said any aid to airlines as requested by Trump would have to be embedded in a larger stimulus bill. Trump later said to talk show radio host Rush Limbaugh that he wanted an even bigger package than either Congressional Republicans and Democrats were proposing. Analysts have called for new fiscal stimulus without which the economic recovery could turn increasingly rocky towards the end of this year, as U.S. households can no longer depend on additional federal unemployment benefits.
