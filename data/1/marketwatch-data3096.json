The week began with gold trading in record territory, but will end with \u201cseveral factors weighing on the price of gold,\u201d including hopes for a COVID-19 vaccine and a rise in Treasury yields, said Chris Gaffney, president of World Markets at TIAA Bank. Higher yields in government debt have been attributed to some of the softness in the gold, which doesn\u2019t offer a yield. The 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.777% on Thursday touched its highest in eight weeks. In Friday dealings, it was trading at 0.693% compared with 0.562% last Friday. \u201cThe \u2018cost of carry\u2019 of gold is negative in the current environment as investors are not sacrificing interest to carry hard assets such as gold,\u201d Gaffney told MarketWatch. December gold GCZ20, +2.17% GC00, +2.17% retreated $20.60, or nearly 1.1%, to settle at $1,949.80 an ounce, after climbing 1.1% on Thursday. Gold prices saw a weekly decline of about 3.9%, based on the most-active contract\u2019s settlement last Friday, which snapped a nine-week win streak, according to FactSet data. On Tuesday, futures prices suffered the biggest daily dollar decline since April 15, 2013. Meanwhile, September silver prices US:SIU20 dropped $1.63, or 5.9%, to end at $26.089, after surging 6.7% a day ago. Silver suffered a 5.3% weekly loss. \u201c \u2018If one word could be used to describe gold\u2019s price action this week, the best fit would be \u201cinsane\u201d.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Lukman Otunuga, FXTM \u201cIf one word could be used to describe gold\u2019s price action this week, the best fit would be \u2018insane\u2019,\u201d Lukman Otunuga, senior market analyst at FXTM, told MarketWatch. \u201cAfter experiencing an intense session of profit-taking earlier in the week\u2026the precious metal is trading back above $1,950,\u201d he said. \u201cInvestors still remain attracted towards the precious metal thanks to U.S.-China tensions, the U.S. stimulus stalemate and an unloved U.S. dollar.\u201d Investors Thursday also parsed economic reports in the U.S. to help gauge the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the national economy. A report on U.S. retail sales rose 1.2% in July, coming in weaker than a forecast. U.S. retail sales missed expectations, \u201ca sign the global recovery is slowing,\u201d said Gaffney. \u201cThis is why a vaccine is so important. Consumers will not feel fully confident to travel and spend until they feel safe from the virus.\u201d The U.S.\u2019s report on sales come after a 1.1% decline in Chinese retail sales in July, versus expectations for a flat reading. Separately, a report on U.S. productivity rose at an annualized rate at 7.3% in the second quarter, far surpassing expectations for a reading of 1.4%, based on average estimates from economists polled by MarketWatch. Industrial production rose by a better-than-expected 3% in July, for the third straight monthly gain. Looking ahead, gold traders will continue to monitor \u201cthe possible emergence of a \u2018second wave\u2019 of the virus across Europe and Asia,\u201d as well as interest rates, as gold will benefit if interest rates stay low, said Gaffney. Traders will also watch talk of economic stimulus and the resulting interest in debt levels, he said. Among other metals traded on Comex Thursday, September copper US:HGU20 tacked on nearly 1.9% to $2.859 a pound, for a weekly rise of 2.4%. October platinum PLV20, +3.99% shed 2.4% to $959.10 an ounce, losing 1.2% for the week, and September palladium US:PAU20 lost 3.3% to $2,143.80 an ounce\u2014down 1.5% from the week-ago finish."}]}
