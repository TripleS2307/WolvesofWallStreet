The U.S. added about 48,000 new cases on Monday, and 524 fatalities, boosting the death toll to 156,133. A Wall Street Journal analysis of Johns Hopkins data found that while infections are slowing in recent hot spots including California and Florida, states in the Northeast and Midwest are seeing increases over a seven-day period. These include Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Jersey, which were previously showing signs they were containing the spread. Florida\u2019s numbers may be understated after the state closed testing sites over the weekend as Hurricane Isa\u00edas approached. The hurricane made landfall in North Carolina instead of Florida, and was causing floods, fires and power outages. President Donald Trump said in an interview with Axios that aired on HBO on Monday night that the virus is \u201cunder control as much as you can control it,\u201d and reiterated his argument that greater levels of testing are behind rising case numbers. Experts have consistently provided the rebuttal that testing is not the reason for high figures and that the U.S. needs to step up the pace of testing, along with tracing contacts and isolating them to get the pandemic under control. Capitol Report:This is \u2018the cognitive test Trump didn\u2019t pass\u2019: Internet reacts to president\u2019s \u2018shocking\u2019 Axios interview A Harvard Global Health Institute tracker shows 10 states flashing red, meaning they have at least 25 new cases per 100,000 people over a seven-day period, which researchers say means they are at a tipping point, where stay-at-home measures are necessary again. Those states are Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, Nevada, Tennessee, Arizona, South Carolina and Oklahoma. Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, expressed his frustration with this Trump tweet on testing that again called on schools to reopen: iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } \u201cThis is the kind of comment that makes it so hard to open schools safely,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to get our kids back to school. But we can\u2019t do it with noise and bluster.\u201d \u201cWe need to: stop polarizing the issue, stop pitting teachers against kids; and make this a science-based discussion,\u201d Jha tweeted, adding: \u201cSo frustrating.\u201d The head of the United Nations, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said overnight that more than a billion children have had their educations disrupted by the pandemic and getting them safely back into classrooms is a priority. But a study from the U.K., which has the fourth highest death toll from COVID-19 in the world, found that without adequate procedures to test and trace positive cases, there could be a wave of COVID-19 cases later in the year. The study, which was published in the Lancet, used a model developed by researchers from University College London and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and found there could be twice as many infections in December as in the initial outbreak without a strategy to contain them. \u201cTo prevent a second COVID-19 wave, relaxation of physical distancing, including reopening of schools, in the U.K. must be accompanied by large-scale, population-wide testing of symptomatic individuals and effective tracing of their contacts, followed by isolation of diagnosed individuals,\u201d the authors warned.Latest tallies There are now 18.36 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, the Johns Hopkins data show, and at least 695,848 people have died. The data indicate that 10.9 million people have recovered. Brazil is second to the U.S. by case number at 2.75 million and by deaths at 94,665. Mexico has the third highest death toll at 48,012 and sixth highest case tally at 443,813. That\u2019s after India, with 1.9 million cases, Russia with 859,762 cases and South Africa with 518,862. The U.K. has the highest death toll in Europe and fourth highest in the world at 46,295, and 307,256 confirmed cases. See:Dr. Osterholm: Americans will be living with the coronavirus for decades There was bad news from France when its COVID-19 scientific council said that country is at risk of losing control of the pandemic \u201cat any moment.\u201d The warning came as official data showed the first increase in intensive-care patients since April. The council said in a paper prepared for the French government that \u201cthe virus has recently been circulating more actively, with an increased loss of distancing and barrier measures\u201d since France ended its lockdown in May. \u201cThe balance is fragile, and we can change course at any time to a less controlled scenario like in Spain, for example,\u201d it said.

A group of four former commissioners of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration made the case Tuesday for the use of convalescent blood plasma as a treatment for COVID-19. In an op-ed in the Washington Post, Mark McClellan, Margaret Hamburg, Robert Califf and Scott Gottlieb said that if the plasma does work, it could help mitigate the impact of the pandemic. Blood plasma has been used as a treatment for infectious diseases for a century, they explained, including during the 1918 flu pandemic. The idea is to use one patient\u2019s successful defense system of antibodies to bolster the immune response of a newly infected person, they wrote. \u201cBut if this is going to work, we need to do it right,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe need a concerted effort to collect blood plasma, along with clinical trials to determine when its benefits outweigh the risks so we can treat the right people at the right time. With that evidence in hand, we need to maintain a highly synchronized distribution system to get the plasma to the right health-care facilities in a timely and equitable way.\u201d The Wall Street Journal reported last week that the FDA is close to issuing an emergency-use authorization for blood plasma and an announcement could come as early as this week, and Trump on Monday called on Americans who have beaten the infection to consider a donation. Elsewhere, Abiomed Inc. ABMD, +0.87% said its Impella heart pump had received an emergency-use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for some COVID-19 patients. The heart pump can be used for patients who have heart or lung damage as a result of an infection with the coronavirus. This is the second time the FDA has authorized the pump for use in COVID-19 patients; in May, the FDA issued an EUA for patients suffering from COVID-19\u2013related right ventricular complications.

The Southfield, Mich.\u2013based maker of car seats\u2019 quarter \u201cwas one of the most challenging in our history,\u201d Chief Executive Ray Scott said in a statement. \u201cOur business was negatively impacted by unprecedented production shutdowns in our major markets in April and May.
