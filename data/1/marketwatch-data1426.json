Joe Raedle/Getty Images \u00c2 There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really no other way to say it: the president of the United States is trying to sabotage the U.S. election by denying the Postal Service\u00c2 money it needs\u00c2 to process voting by mail. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not subtle, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not seriously disputed that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trying to do this\u00e2\u0080\u0094in fact, President Donald Trump came right out and\u00c2 admitted what he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doing.\u00c2 It is\u00c2 welcome news\u00c2 that Postmaster General and Trump megadonor Louis DeJoy has announced that the Post Office \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill deliver the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s election mail on time\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but it is astounding that it was necessary to issue this statement. DeJoy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s statement is essentially the equivalent of a bank telling customers it has enough money to meet any demands from depositors\u00e2\u0080\u0094it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the kind of thing that, one would think, would normally go without saying. The reason DeJoy felt compelled to issue this \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe sky is still blue\u00e2\u0080\u009d statement is because\u00c2 voters have gotten concerned\u00c2 that they couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t trust the Postal Service to carry out its normal function. These concerns did not materialize out of thin air: USPS had recently told 46 states and DC that\u00c2 it couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t guarantee delivery\u00c2 of last-minute ballot requests in time for the election, and there were reports of\u00c2 delays in mail delivery.\u00c2 Sadly, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth\u00c2 updating and\u00c2 applying Ronald Reagan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s old \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrust, but verify\u00e2\u0080\u009d maxim to both DeJoy and Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0094although for this crew, we have to call it \u00e2\u0080\u009cdon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t trust, but be absolutely sure to verify.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2 Senators should hold DeJoy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feet to the fire if he testifies before the Homeland Security and Government Affairs committee\u00c2 this Friday. They should make sure they receive updates before the election in order to ensure that DeJoy fulfills his promise of on-time delivery in the context of the election.\u00c2 Senators should also gather information from rank-and-file postal employees in order to find out whether more changes are needed\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, a reversal of DeJoy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cbans on overtime and extra delivery trips.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They should also make sure USPS has the money it needs to carry out its mission. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin echoes his boss in saying\u00c2 aid supported by Democrats isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessary: senators should determine for themselves whether this is indeed the case. But we should also recognize that, even if DeJoy keeps to his word and the Postal Service has all the funding it needs, at least two other problems remain.\u00c2 First, damage to voter confidence\u00c2 may already have been done. Second, there is no indication that Trump has given up on his efforts to sabotage the election. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clear that Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strategy has at least three related goals: 1) suppress the mail-in vote, which he believes will\u00c2 favor his opponent, Joe Biden; 2) allow Trump to\u00c2 claim victory on Nov. 3\u00c2 if he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leading in the early returns while mail-in ballots remain to be counted; and 3) if none of that works and Biden wins anyway, baselessly\u00c2 plant enough doubt\u00c2 in the minds of his supporters that they will incorrectly\u00c2 believe the election was illegitimate. This perfidious effort to manipulate the election is nothing new and will come as no surprise to anyone who has been following Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s twisted electoral strategy and, indeed, his political career.\u00c2 In 2016, Trump\u00c2 welcomed Russian assistance\u00c2 aimed at improving his chances in the election. When that episode was exposed, a number of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s associates\u00c2 were convicted of crimes.\u00c2 Breaking news: Trump campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s contacts with Russia posed \u00e2\u0080\u0098grave\u00e2\u0080\u0099 risk in 2016, bipartisan Senate intelligence report concludes Last year, Trump\u00c2 tried to pressure\u00c2 Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president into illicitly tilting the electoral scales in Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s favor by falsely smearing Joe Biden. When that plot was exposed, Trump was impeached.\u00c2 But Trump is resourceful when it comes to trying to stay in power, and impeachment didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop him from looking for ways to gain an underhanded advantage in the election (Sen. Susan Collins\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hopes\u00c2 notwithstanding).\u00c2 People who have become attached to the\u00c2 notion of constitutional democracy\u00c2 can be forgiven if they are worried. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s essential to take a deep breath, maintain perspective and not panic.\u00c2 Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions reflect his desperation. He is\u00c2 trailing in the polls\u00c2 and knows he could use a boost\u00e2\u0080\u0094even an ill-gotten one. The fact that Trump is relying on a deeply immoral,\u00c2 possibly illegal\u00c2 scheme to shore up his chances at re-election does not guarantee he will succeed\u00e2\u0080\u0094far from it. One thing we have in our favor\u00e2\u0080\u0094those of us who feel strongly about free and fair elections\u00e2\u0080\u0094is that Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plan has been exposed with nearly three months to go before the election takes place. That means we have time to take a deep breath and make a plan for preserving our democracy against Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s despicable efforts to take it away. Trump wants Biden voters to\u00c2 lose faith in the process\u00c2 and to incorrectly believe that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no point to voting by mail. DeJoy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s statement may help shore up some of that voter confidence\u00e2\u0080\u0094but, no matter what Trump, DeJoy or anyone else does, there are steps we can all take to make sure our vote is counted\u00e2\u0080\u0094no matter who we choose to vote for. Voting experts tell us there are concrete, specific actions all voters\u00e2\u0080\u0094no matter who they vote for\u00e2\u0080\u0094can take to make sure their vote counts (as Michelle Obama alluded to in\u00c2 her powerful speech last night). Here are a few important points to keep in mind, depending on the rules in your state (and please be sure to\u00c2 confirm information\u00c2 with your state and local election officials): If your state allows voting by mail and you need to request a mail ballot, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wait\u00e2\u0080\u0094request it now. When you receive your ballot, again, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wait\u00e2\u0080\u0094return it as soon as you can. One voting rights expert calls the strategy of moving promptly with mail-in ballots a good way to \u00e2\u0080\u009cflatten the absentee ballot curve\u00e2\u0080\u009d. You can\u00c2 track your ballot online\u00c2 to receive confirmation that it was received and accepted. Alternatively, in some states you\u00c2 may be able\u00c2 to use a\u00c2 ballot drop box\u00c2 or you may be allowed to drop off your ballot at\u00c2 an election office or polling location, all of which can allow you to skip the mail process when you cast your ballot. In the\u00c2 41 states that allow it, early voting can be\u00c2 another way\u00c2 to make sure your cote is counted. Some states begin early in person voting\u00c2 45 days before the election\u00c2 and some have weekend voting options, meaning you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to wait until the last minute. As\u00c2 voting expert Michael McDonald says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to be afraid if your mail ballot does not arrive or [you decide you] don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to vote [by mail]. You can always vote in-person. Election officials have safeguards to ensure no duplicate votes. You may need to bring your mail ballot (if you have it) or vote a provisional ballot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump has tried to scare voters out of using the mail by falsely making them think they may have to worry about their vote getting in on time. He knows this is naked deception\u00e2\u0080\u0094he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2 apparently using the mail himself to vote in Florida\u00e2\u0080\u0099s primary, as he has in the past. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions are an act of desperation, the acts of an amoral man who knows he is trailing in the polls and will do whatever he can to try to gain an edge.\u00c2 Whether you use the mail or another available option (depending on where you live) you have the power here, not Trump. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what it means to have a democracy\u00e2\u0080\u0094power resides in \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe the people\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\u00c2 It will require\u00c2 a little planning\u00c2 and now is certainly not a time to procrastinate when it comes to the most cherished right in a democracy. People in Belarus are risking and in some cases\u00c2 enduring torture\u00c2 to stand up for a free and fair election. Thankfully, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need the same level of courage to make our democracy work.\u00c2 If his efforts to undermine confidence in the Postal Service don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work, Trump will surely try something else\u00e2\u0080\u0094but he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s running out of time.\u00c2 If we are careful, if we are responsible, and if we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give in to Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scare tactics, we have all the tools we need to make sure our vote is counted\u00e2\u0080\u0094which is the last thing Trump wants, as his\u00c2 cartoon villain\u00c2 actions make clear.
