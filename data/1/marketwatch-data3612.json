He and his family are currently enjoying time in the Italian sun. He went on vacation to Italy, despite the advice of his own government to limit travel overseas. Cawley, who previously served as the deputy chief executive and chief operations officer of Irish airline Ryanair RYAAY, -2.08%, said that he resigned from his post as the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tourism Czar with \u00e2\u0080\u009cgreat regret,\u00e2\u0080\u009d adding, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI fully support the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policy on tourism. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will continue to help the industry emerge from its current difficulties,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cawley said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt has been a privilege to serve as chair of F\u00c3\u00a1ilte Ireland and to have contributed to the massive growth which Irish tourism has enjoyed prior to this global pandemic.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs has been reported in the media this morning, I am on a pre-arranged family holiday in Italy, which is on the Government green list.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He handed in his resignation the same day Ireland reported the highest number of new coronavirus infections in three months.

News that the chairman of F\u00c3\u00a1ilte Ireland, the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tourism board, would take such a trip was greeted with a mixture of disbelief and disappointment among the public and lawmakers alike. Cawley is listed as a member of the board of directors of no-frills airline Ryanair. F\u00c3\u00a1ilte Ireland had been spearheading a major campaign to convince Irish people to avoid flying to Italy or other places on Ireland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cgreen list\u00e2\u0080\u009d and to vacation at home and support local businesses. (People returning from \u00e2\u0080\u009cgreen list\u00e2\u0080\u009d countries do not have to quarantine for 14 days.) Dispatches from a pandemic: Ireland is a nation of saints, scholars and the status quo. When the sun shines in Ireland, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not unusual to hear someone say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098You could be in Italy right now.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (Photo: Quentin Fottrell.) Last July, the Irish government has announced a tax credit or rebate for vacationing in Ireland. Domestic holidaymakers will receive \u00e2\u0082\u00ac125 ($148) if they spend roughly \u00e2\u0082\u00ac600 ($710) on accommodation and restaurants. Couples will be able to claim \u00e2\u0082\u00ac250 ($296). The so-called vacation subsidy will be available until October and will apply to hotels, restaurants and non-alcoholic drinks. The scheme was designed to help stimulate an economy flattened by the coronavirus pandemic, but also to dissuade people from traveling abroad and spreading the virus. Martin said it was important that people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t undertake non-essential travel. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would encourage everyone to support the tourism and hospitality industries in any way they can, and am taking my own holidays in this country. F\u00c3\u00a1ilte Ireland will continue to promote holidaying in Ireland,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Martin said. Johns Hopkins University ranks Ireland as No. 15 in the world on a list of COVID-related deaths per capita: 36.5 per 100,000 with a case-fatality rate of 6.6%. For comparison, the U.S. is ranked at No. 10 with a fatality rate of 51.5 per 100,000 and a case-fatality rate of 3.2%. Ireland, a country with a population of 4.9 million excluding the British province of Northern Ireland, has also recorded one of the highest rates of COVID-related nursing-home deaths in the world. Some 62% of fatalities from the virus occurred in nursing homes, a rate only exceeded by Canada. Last Monday, the Irish government introduced a mandatory face-mask policy in stores four months after the World Health Organization and other international health authorities changed their official policy on face masks, recommending people wear them to help stop the spread of the virus.

The government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s National Public Health Emergency Team is convening on Monday to review the rise in infections. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe phased reopening of the country has afforded people the opportunity to socialize with each other again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Glynn said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHowever, some are doing this recklessly and undermining the efforts of the majority of people around the country who are following public health advice. This cannot continue,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis pandemic isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t over just because we are tired of living with it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The weather in Ireland during the August has been choppy at best: temperatures have frequently fallen into the low 60s, and mist and rain casts a blanket over much of this island on the northwestern periphery of Europe on Monday. It is certainly not reminiscent of the Italian Rivera. But lawmakers have urged people to abide by new face-mask regulations introduced this month, asking people to wear face coverings in stores, and have pleaded with people to avoid traveling abroad for purposes other than essential work-related travel or emergencies. Many are listening. London-listed Ryanair DE:RYA \u00c2 RYAAY, -2.08% \u00c2 shares fell Monday after saying it was cutting capacity by 20% in September and October. Forward bookings have \u00e2\u0080\u009cnotably weakened over the last 10 days, given continuing uncertainty over recent COVID case rates in some EU countries.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Coronavirus update: COVID-19 has now killed at least 776,157 people worldwide. As of Monday, the U.S. has the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases (5,408,268) and deaths (170,131). Worldwide, confirmed cases are now at 21,720,713. The Dow Jones Industrial Index DJIA, +0.56% was down slightly Monday, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% and Nasdaq COMP, +1.39% \u00c2 were trading marginally higher as investors await progress on a vaccine and details of round two of the economic stimulus program."}]}
