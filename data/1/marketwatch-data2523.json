Powell continued to push Congress to support more spending to help unemployed Americans and small businesses. He said the economy was in a \"critical phase\" and support would be timely. During his first day of testimony, Powell said there were signs of an economic rebound in the economy but cautioned that the level of output and employment was well below pre-pandemic levels. Powell defended the Fed's more than $2 trillion in asset purchases and said the central bank's buying of corporate bonds was precautionary in case the economy weakened again. The Fed chairman insisted the central bank wasn't trying to be an elephant in the bond market. Follow along as MarketWatch covers the Fed chairman's Q&A session with lawmakers."}]}
