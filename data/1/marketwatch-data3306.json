The contracts still have a \u00e2\u0080\u009clong way to go before being considered a global benchmark,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at The Price Futures Group. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne would think with the amount of demand in China\u00e2\u0080\u00a6the contract would have been red hot, but it has been slow to take off.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098One would think with the amount of demand in China\u00e2\u0080\u00a6the contract would have been red hot, but it has been slow to take off.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Phil Flynn, The Price Futures Group China, which is the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest importer of crude oil, has a history of \u00e2\u0080\u009cchanging the rules of the game as it is being played,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which makes it difficult for traders to \u00e2\u0080\u009cfeel totally comfortable trading in that contract for the long run,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says. Also, \u00e2\u0080\u009cChinese currency manipulation and its previous peg to the dollar will make it hard for pure price discovery over the long run,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Flynn. Even so, there will be times when that market will provide \u00e2\u0080\u009cattractive opportunities for sophisticated traders.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That should allow the market to \u00e2\u0080\u009ckeep some liquidity, but there will have to be a big change in the regulatory structure in China to keep the contract viable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Oil futures contracts on the Shanghai International Energy Exchange, or INE, have seen open interest about double over the past year. On July 15, the main Shanghai crude-oil contract closed at 307.9 yuan per barrel, up 2.4 yuan or 0.8%, with open interest for the contract at 45,567. Open interest for all Shanghai crude-oil contracts was at 120,874, compared with open interest of 64,168 at the same time a year ago. Trading in Chinese oil futures, however, remains well off the millions of contracts in open interest traded daily in global benchmarks Brent BRN.1, -0.07% and West Texas Intermediate CL.1, -1.62% crude futures markets. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWTI and Brent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s contracts are followed more closely than Chinese contracts, generally, since oil is a monopoly in China,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Stan Bharti, CEO of Forbes & Manhattan. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all domestic.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Covid-19 pandemic, meanwhile, has shown that \u00e2\u0080\u009cas time goes on, there will be two markets for oil\u00e2\u0080\u0094one for domestic oil and local producers that won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be impacted by much of the global market, and one for the international market that will service countries\u00e2\u0080\u009d that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t big oil or energy producers, said Bharti. While Chinese oil futures track WTI\u00c2 and Brent, they are \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery local-focused contracts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and China \u00e2\u0080\u009cdoesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t produce enough oil on a global stage to alter the price in major industries.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Still, Michael Corley, president of Mercatus Energy Advisors, estimates that oil futures on the INE have seen their global market share volume, versus Brent, WTI, Dubai, and Oman oil futures, increase to roughly 10%\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cpretty strong for only a little over two years\u00e2\u0080\u009d since their launch. Corley believes that Chinese oil futures will continue to attract interest, but are \u00e2\u0080\u009cunlikely to develop into a dominant global benchmark with volume and open interest similar to Brent and WTI.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The contracts are not widely accessible to non-Chinese traders and with the pricing in yuan amid concerns among foreign firms regarding capital controls, he says, referring to the ability to freely move funds in and out of the country. That ability is especially important given the amount of capital required to trade oil at the institutional level, he says. When it comes to these contracts, however, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmajor traders and brokers are active\u00e2\u0080\u00a6and will become more active if they think that the opportunities are greater than the risks, and that trading the contract will ultimately be beneficial to their bottom line,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Corley."}]}
