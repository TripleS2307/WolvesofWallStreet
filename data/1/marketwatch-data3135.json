As restaurants reopen, the CDC has an answer", "body": "Are you worried about getting coronavirus if you dine out or order in? Here\u2019s some good news: The risk of getting the disease from consuming food is \u201cthought to be very low,\u201d according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cCoronaviruses, like the one that causes COVID-19, are thought to spread mostly person-to-person through respiratory droplets when someone coughs, sneezes, or talks,\u201d the CDC said Monday. That news comes as more than 3,000 New York City restaurants reopened for outdoor dining on Monday as part of the state\u2019s Phase 2 reopening policy. \u201cCurrently, no cases of COVID-19 have been identified where infection was thought to have occurred by touching food, food packaging, or shopping bags,\u201d the agency said. Additionally, the virus that causes COVID-19 \u201ccannot grow on foods.\u201d However, the CDC recommends that you \u201cwash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds\u201d or use \u201chand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol\u201d before preparing or eating food.

While many restaurants have started using digital menus and have disposable utensils, simply touching your chair or salt shaker if they weren\u2019t properly disinfected could cause you to get coronavirus, Benjamin Chapman, a professor at North Carolina State University, told MarketWatch. \u201cIf someone was sick and walked into a store and coughed on the handles of self-serve buffet utensils and you then touched your face, you could get coronavirus.\u201d But you should obviously not use cleaning supplies to disinfect your food, poison-control experts say. For fruits and vegetables, the CDC recommends rinsing them \u201cunder cold, running tap water\u201d and scrubbing them \u201cwith a clean produce brush.\u201d \u201cSalt, pepper, vinegar, lemon juice, and lime juice have not been shown to be effective at removing germs on produce,\u201d the agency added."}]}
