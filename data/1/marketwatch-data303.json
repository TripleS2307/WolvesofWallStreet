Sales in the quarter were stable at 1.57 billion Swiss francs ($1.71 billion), the Swiss flavor and fragrance maker said. For the first nine months of the year, sales grew 2.7% to CHF4.79 billion, the company said. On a like-for-like basis, sales increased 3.7%. \"In the product segments most affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, namely fine fragrances and, to a lesser extent, active beauty in fragrance and beauty and food service in taste and well-being, the group experienced a continued reduction in business activity, as the restrictions related to the Covid-19 pandemic curtailed retail and travel retail activity as well as out-of-home food consumption,\" said the company about the January-September period. \"We aim to outpace the market with 4%-5% sales growth and a free cash flow of 12-17% of sales, both measured as an average over the five-year period of our strategy cycle,\" Givaudan said.
