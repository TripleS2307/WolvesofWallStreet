The bipartisan bill now goes to the House of Representatives, where a companion bill has been introduced. Sens. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, and Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican, said China's introduction of new national-security laws in Hong Kong made the legislation more urgent, the Wall Street Journal writes. The bill aims to pressure Beijing to preserve Hong Kong's special status."}]}
