It is part of The Coronavirus Outbreak: What You Need To Know Special Report. Demand is keen, training is provided, pay exceeds minimum wage and you can often work from home. With Americans now facing a pandemic and the highest unemployment rate since the Great Depression, COVID-19 contact tracer has become the job of the moment. \u201cWhen I read about contact tracing and how crucial it would be to getting our world back on track, I thought \u2018That is something I could do,\u2019\u201d says Allison Stratton, 56, of San Diego. Plus, her mother-in-law died from COVID-19 in April. \u201cSince I couldn\u2019t help her, I really wanted to help where I could,\u201d Stratton says. She\u2019d had experience with computer software and customer service, skills her county was looking for in contact tracers. So, after seeing an ad on Facebook for contact tracing in her area, Stratton applied. Following a background check, she was accepted and was asked to report for a week of training on the following Monday. These days, Stratton is working full time as a contact tracer in San Diego County for $19.50 per hour.Contact tracing: an old job with new urgency While contact tracing is a new concept to many Americans, public health departments have depended on tracers for decades to control the spread of contagious diseases from syphilis to tuberculosis to HIV. The pandemic job: finding everyone who has been in close contact with a coronavirus-infected person and keep them from passing on the virus to others. Anyone who has been within 6 feet of an infected person for at least 10 to 15 minutes \u2014 from two days before the time they started seeing symptoms \u2014 is at risk. State and local public health department looking for, and hiring, tracers, do things differently. Some contact-tracing jobs are full time; others are part time. Some states are using volunteers or employing furloughed or reassigned government workers or local students only. Pay \u2014 when there is pay \u2014 ranges from $15 to $27 per hour. All tracers receive comprehensive training and get a script before they begin. Also see: The best side gigs you can do from home Each state and county has its own qualifying criteria for the job. You may or may not need a bachelor\u2019s degree, a health background or experience with certain computer software. Listening and interpersonal skills are essential, however, along with being meticulous. Fluency in a second language or social work experience may be pluses.How to learn the rules and get trained It\u2019s best to check with your health department to learn its rules. You can also sign up with an independent recruiter like the nonpartisan CONTRACE Public Health Corps, which screens and refers qualified applicants. Or, for training, you can register for a free six-hour Coursera tracing course, developed by the Bloomberg School of Public Health at John\u2019s Hopkins University. The Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO) also offers a free three-hour online course on contact tracing. Melissa Monteiro, regional managing director of the nationwide recruiting firm Atrium, oversees contact recruitment for Kentucky. For her tracers, \u201cit\u2019s more about soft skills. You don\u2019t need health experience or a certain background.\u201d When screening candidates, Monteiro looks for people who are inquisitive, empathetic and who can quickly build trust. \u201cPeople passionate about wanting to help others do really well,\u201d Monteiro adds. Cultural sensitivity is a must, too, says Elizabeth Ruebush, a director of infectious diseases at ASTHO in Arlington, Va. \u201cThe tracer has to assess whether the contact is comfortable speaking in English or understands what is being asked. Or whether there may be sensitivity around the person\u2019s immigration status,\u201d says Ruebush, who co-authored the ASTHO course, which is used to train contact tracers in many states.What contact tracers need Tracers also need resilience and fortitude. \u201cYou may be talking to people who are really sick. Or contacts may be resistant and not forthcoming with information,\u201d says Monteiro. \u201cPeople think contact tracing is super easy, but it\u2019s not.\u201d The job requires persistence, too, notes Ruebush: \u201cIt takes a few calls to track down some contacts.\u201d She likens the job to detective work, since the list of someone\u2019s contacts can range from a handful to more than five dozen. The cold call can be stressful, Ruebush says. \u201cPeople may not feel comfortable opening up immediately. You need to assure the person the call is confidential, and your intention is to support them and protect their contacts.\u201d Tracers inform contacts of their exposure to the coronavirus on a particular day, but provide no details about the identity of the infected person. They list COVID-19 symptoms and ask if the contacts have experienced any of them. The contacts are then advised to get tested for the virus and the tracer finds out who they have been around. And a new contact list begins.What coronavirus contacts are told Contacts are asked to quarantine or isolate for a period of days based on their virus exposure date. Even if the exposed person has no symptoms, the tracer encourages them to stay home, check their temperature regularly and call a doctor if symptoms arise. The tracer also explores whether assistance is needed for medical care, child care, grocery delivery or other social services while quarantining. After each call, the tracer completes a form and submits it to a supervisor. Over the next two weeks, the tracer follows up for updates. Bear in mind that some public health departments are inundated with tracer applications. San Diego County took down the ad Stratton responded to after getting more than 1,000 applications within a few days. Read: Yes, America needs to brace itself for a second wave of coronavirus \u201cNot hearing back doesn\u2019t necessarily mean [the applicant] won\u2019t be needed in the future, though,\u201d says Ruebush. \u201cAs communities reopen, more cases will follow.\u201d Elaine Replogle of Eugene, Oreg., applied to be a tracer in early May. She teaches part-time at the University of Oregon and felt highly qualified to be a tracer, having proficiency in Spanish, a doctoral degree in medical sociology and research interview experience. Like many others, however, she has received no reply. Eve Glicksman is a freelance journalist in Silver Spring, Md.
