As individual states ease measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus, transport fuel demand will \u201cnaturally begin to increase,\u201d but the rate of the rebound will vary by fuel type, she says. Weekly demand for jet fuel dropped to just 352,000 barrels a day for the week ended on May 8, the lowest based on Energy Information Administration data going back to 1991. It climbed to 788,000 barrels a day as of the week ended on June 12, but remains far below the year\u2019s peak of more than 1.7 million barrels a day by mid-March. Jet fuel demand has been \u201canemic\u201d as Americans stayed away from planes from the onset of the pandemic, says Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. It could take several years or longer, or until a vaccine is developed, to see a full recovery, given \u201colder fuel-guzzling jets being retired first to reduce capacity,\u201d he says. Jet fuel is \u201cthe most challenged mainstream hydrocarbon coming out of the barrel,\u201d he adds. Similarly, Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for the Oil Price Information Service, refers to jet fuel as \u201chopeless in 2020,\u201d with refiners trying to make as few barrels of jet fuel as possible because \u201cit is a loser, in terms of margin and the ability to move it.\u201d Diesel, meanwhile, saw an early demand surge before the lockdowns as \u201cAmericans panicked and hit stores hard,\u201d says De Haan. Factories temporarily raised production, and products were sent to market quickly, \u201cgenerating more demand for trucks,\u201d which primarily use diesel fuel, before eventually experiencing a slowdown as businesses began shutting down. Diesel was a \u201csaving grace for refiners\u201d early on, he says. Now, \u201cit has quickly taken the ugly-brother role from gasoline, which has seen notable recovery due to cabin fever as summer temperatures arrive.\u201d Vander Zanden says that while some fuel demand has returned, U.S. gasoline sales are still down by 21% year over year; diesel, down 20%; and jet, fuel down 62%, citing EIA data for the week ended on June 12. \u201cGasoline\u2019s rebound will likely emerge more rapidly than other transport fuels,\u201d she says. Weekly motor gasoline demand hit a low this year of nearly five million barrels a day for the week ended on April 3, EIA data show. It has since climbed to 7.87 million barrels a day. \u201cGasoline demand will benefit from vacationers taking the great American road trip instead of flying to their destination, and also as commuters shun public transportation,\u201d says Brian Milne, editor, product manager at commodity analysis provider DTN. Still, with so many people out of work and many more working from home, gasoline demand will remain under pressure for months, he says. The average price for regular unleaded gasoline at the pump stood at $2.12 a gallon Friday afternoon, according to GasBuddy. That\u2019s up 21.1 cents from a month ago, but down 55.1 cents from a year ago. On the futures market, reformulated gasoline for July delivery US:RBN20 settled at $1.2716 a gallon on Friday, up around 24% for the month, but still down over 25% for the year, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Overall, the Covid-19-related lockdowns are likely to affect petroleum consumption for years, and may not even see a full recovery in our lifetimes, as businesses adapt to working from home, warns De Haan. Transportation fuels will also have to contend with the risk of a second wave of Covid-19 as states emerge from shutdowns. \u201cApprehension among consumers and investors will stall future economic growth, keeping spending low, personal savings high, and demand for goods and commercial trucking in neutral,\u201d Vander Zanden says."}]}
