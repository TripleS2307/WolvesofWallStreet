The Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index rose to 56% in August from 54.2% in July. Readings over 50% indicate growth. Economists surveyed by MarketWatch had forecast the index to total 54.9%. Althought the index hit a 21-month high, manufacturers aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t doing as well now as they were two years ago. Businesses executives are asked if their companies are doing better or worse compared with the prior month, but the survey doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t reveal how much better. Most manufacturers are producing fewer goods with fewer workers than they were before the coronavirus pandemic. The index had fallen to an 11-year low of 41.5% in April during the height of the crisis.

The index for new orders jumped to 67.6% from 61.5%, marking the highest level since 2004. Yet other measures of actual production show new orders are actually still about 5% below precrisis levels. The production gauge rose to 63.3% from 62.1%. Timothy Fiore, chairman of the survey, said executives were \u00e2\u0080\u009cgenerally optimistic\u00e2\u0080\u009d but \u00e2\u0080\u009cto a lesser degree compared with July.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Coronavirus cases spiked during the summer and sapped the economy of some of the momentum built up in May and June. The employment gauge, meanwhile, also increased, but manufacturers have reduced hours and staff levels because of weaker domestic and foreign demand for their products. The employment index crept up to 46.4%, but any number below 50% is a negative sign. Fifteen of the 18 industries tracked by ISM expanded in August up from 13 in the prior month. The ISM index is compiled from a survey of executives who order raw materials and other supplies for their companies. The gauge tends to rise or fall in tandem with the health of the economy. See: MarketWatch Economic Calendar Big picture: Manufacturers are outperforming other key segments of the economy and helping to lead a recovery. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the good news. The bad news? They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel confident enough to bring back more workers or to justify new investments. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMany panelists\u00e2\u0080\u0099 companies are holding off on capital investments for the rest of 2020,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Fiore said. The cautionary approach is likely to act as a brake on the recovery and prevent the economy from speeding up much before the end of the year.
