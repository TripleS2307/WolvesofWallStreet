Shaw takes 5.2% stake", "body": "Shares of Eastman Kodak Co. KODK, +12.98% were up more than 20% in after-hours trading Monday after the company disclosed that D.E. Shaw & Co. has taken a 5.2% stake in the company. Kodak said in filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that D.E. Shaw has amassed 3.94 million shares of its stock. David E. Shaw is the president and sole shareholder of D.E. Shaw & Co., though the filing notes that he doesn't own any of the shares directly. Kodak shares rallied in late July after the company won a government loan to help with domestic production of pharmaceutical ingredients, but now that loan is on hold amid government scrutiny. The stock is up 128% since July 27, before the loan was reported, but it's down 82% from its July 29 peak. Kodak shares have risen 141% over the past three months as the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% has gained 15%."}]}
