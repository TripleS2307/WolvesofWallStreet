However, in a coronavirus-infected world, a small premium is totally acceptable, experts say. In a June report, global consultancy AlixPartners advises retailers to begin taking steps to \u201cstop the margin leakage\u201d and consider new pricing tools and strategies. Perhaps, the report suggests, a retailer doesn\u2019t need to have the same price for an item in stores and online. \u201cCustomers may be more accepting of different prices across channels right now because these variations will likely be prevalent everywhere as all retailers work to get margins back in line with elevated e-commerce penetration,\u201d the report said.

But these are unique times. \u201cOverall, consumers\u2019 willingness to accept price differences between online and in-store has increased as e-commerce penetration has grown and more shoppers have grown to understand and appreciate the convenience of home delivery or click-and-collect,\u201d said Joel Rampoldt, a managing director in the retail practice at AlixPartners. There will be 7.4 million new online shoppers in 2020, according to an eMarketer forecast, with 204 million people in the U.S. ages 14 and older making an e-commerce purchase. Grocery retailer Kroger Co. KR, +0.46% said digital sales grew 92% in the most recent quarter. Walmart Inc. WMT, +1.00% said online sales grew 74%. And Costco Wholesale Corp. COST, +1.19% reported 64.5% digital sales growth in fiscal third-quarter. The increased cost of all this online shopping can put a major squeeze on margins.

And click-and-collect became popular as consumers sought ways to purchase what they needed with the least amount of interaction with other human beings as possible. \u201cConvenience is dazzling,\u201d he said. Rampoldt also says that customers don\u2019t price compare as much as retailers think they do. Instead, customers are more concerned about a change in price to the overall cost of the shopping trip. If the purchase is convenient, the price difference reasonable, and customers can get the items they\u2019re looking for, including seasonal items or other things that they may not buy often, like sunscreen in the summer, then a little price difference won\u2019t hurt. \u201cThe bigger effect will be where they choose to shop; where they feel they\u2019ll get a better price overall on their basket going out,\u201d he said. Others think this strategy is all wrong. \u201cPricing online pressures margin because consumers are just one-click away from another retailer competing on price. Online forces price commoditization (Thank you Amazon),\u201d said Jonathan Treiber, chief executive of RevTrax, a deal management platform. \u201cThe only way the a retailer can compete omnichannel is to price consistently across channels and make the rest of the online shopping experience differentiated so that price isn\u2019t the only factor for customers.\u201d Those experiences can include fast shipping and easy returns. Also:Bubble Wrap maker SealedAir and Simplehuman CEOs are prepping for a touchless future after coronavirus But the question of \u201cvalue\u201d and what consumers think is worth the price, time or effort comes down to a few factors, including the individual shopper mentality and the economy. We\u2019re in a time when many people are still social distancing while others are quickly heading to beaches, salons and restaurants after a period of confinement. We\u2019re also in a time when unemployment has reached shocking levels with millions out of work, though sales of things like bikes and breadmakers have gone through the roof. Gretchen Jezerc, senior vice president of marketing at First Insight, a retail analytics platform that uses data to help clients make decisions about things like pricing, says research is the best way to determine how to proceed. COVID-19, the jobless situation, racial unrest and the myriad other current events consumers are now dealing with have shifted \u201cconsumer value equations.\u201d Don\u2019t miss: TJX results show shoppers will head back to stores if the price is right, analysts say \u201cSales history data are not predictive of what the future is going to hold,\u201d Jezerc said. \u201cSome of the tools we had in the past for willingness to pay and how to set pricing have gone out the window.\u201d So perhaps customers will be OK with a pricing difference under the right circumstances. But if a customer feels cheated by that tactic, then a retailer may find itself facing a backlash. \u201cWhat hasn\u2019t changed \u2013 if you give the customer the sense they\u2019re being ripped off, it\u2019s a massive perception problem,\u201d said AlixPartners\u2019 Rampoldt."}]}
