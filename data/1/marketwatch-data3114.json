Pelosi is cutting short lawmakers\u2019 summer recess with a vote expected the Saturday after the Democratic National Convention on legislation that would prohibit changes at the agency as tensions mount. President Donald Trump\u2019s new postmaster general, Louis DeJoy, has sparked nationwide outcry over delays, new prices and cutbacks just as millions of Americans will be trying to vote by mail to avoid polling places during the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cIn a time of a pandemic, the Postal Service is Election Central,\u201d Pelosi wrote Sunday in a letter to colleagues, who had been expected to be out of session until September. \u201cLives, livelihoods and the life of our American Democracy are under threat from the president.\u201d The decision to recall the House, made after a weekend of high-level leadership discussions, carries a political punch. Voting in the House will highlight the issue after the weeklong convention nominating Joe Biden as the party\u2019s presidential pick and pressure the Republican-held Senate to respond. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sent senators home for a summer recess. Earlier Sunday, Democratic lawmakers demanded that leaders of the Postal Service testify at an emergency oversight hearing Aug. 24 on mail delays. The House Oversight and Reform Committee said it wants to hear from DeJoy and from the chair of the Postal Service board of governors, Robert \u201cMike\u201d Duncan. With heightened scrutiny of its operations, the Postal Service is now requesting a temporary preelection rate increase, from mid-October through Christmas, although not for first-class letters. The agency did not immediately respond to requests for comment about whether the two men would appear before the House committee. But it said Sunday it would stop removing its distinctive blue mailboxes through mid-November following complaints from customers and members of Congress that the collection boxes were being taken away. \u201cGiven the recent customer concerns the Postal Service will postpone removing boxes for a period of 90 days while we evaluate our customers\u2019 concerns,\u2019\u2019 Postal Service spokeswoman Kimberly Frum said. House Democrats are expected to discuss the lawmakers\u2019 schedule details on a conference call on Monday and were likely to be in session next Saturday, a senior Democratic aide said on condition of anonymity because the plans were private. The legislation being prepared for the vote, the \u201cDelivering for America Act,\u201d would prohibits the Postal Service from implementing any changes to operations or level of service it had in place on Jan. 1. DeJoy, a major Republican donor and ally of the president who took control of the agency in June, has pledged to modernize the money-losing agency to make it more efficient, and has eliminated most overtime for postal workers, imposed restrictions on transportation and reduced of the quantity and use of mail-processing equipment. Trump said last week that he was blocking a $25 billion emergency injection sought by the Postal Service, as well as a Democratic proposal to provide $3.6 billion in additional election money to the states. The Republican president worries that mail-in voting could cost him reelection. The money for the post office is intended to help with processing an expected surge of mail-in ballots. Both funding requests have been tied up in congressional negotiations over a new coronavirus relief package. On Saturday, Trump tried to massage his message, saying he supports increasing money for the Postal Service. He said he was refusing to capitulate to Democrats on other parts of the relief package, including funding for states weighed down by debt accumulated before the pandemic. But the president\u2019s critics were not appeased, contending that Trump has made the calculation that a lower voter turnout would improve his chances of winning a second term. \u201cWhat you are witnessing is a president of the United States who is doing everything he can to suppress the vote, make it harder for people to engage in mail-in balloting at a time when people will be putting their lives on the line by having to go out to a polling station and vote,\u201d said Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. In announcing the upcoming hearing, congressional Democrats said in a statement: \u201cThe postmaster general and top Postal Service leadership must answer to the Congress and the American people as to why they are pushing these dangerous new policies that threaten to silence the voices of millions, just months before the election.\u201d The lawmakers included Pelosi of California and New York Rep. Carolyn Maloney, the committee chair, along with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, the top Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which oversees the Postal Service. Earlier this month, Maloney\u2019s committee had invited DeJoy to appear Sept. 17 at a hearing focusing on operational changes to the Postal Service that are causing delays in mail deliveries. But after Trump acknowledged in a Fox Business interview on Thursday that he\u2019s starving the agency of money to make it harder to process an expected surge of mail-in ballots, the committee decided to move up their call for the appearance of DeJoy\u2019 well as the governing board chair. Funding a cash-strapped Postal Service has quickly turned into a top campaign issue as Trump presses his unsupported claim that increased mail-in voting will undermine the credibility of the election and Democrats push back. Trump, who spent the weekend at his New Jersey golf club, derided universal mail-in voting as a \u201cscam\u201d and defended DeJoy as the right person to \u201cstreamline the post office and make it great again.\u201d His chief of staff, Mark Meadows, tried on Sunday to counter criticism that Trump was trying to stifle turnout with national and battleground state polls showing him facing a difficult path to reelection against Biden. \u201cI\u2019ll give you that guarantee right now: The president of the United States is not going to interfere with anybody casting their vote in a legitimate way, whether it\u2019s the post office or anything else,\u201d Meadows said. But Democrats said changes made by DeJoy constitute \u201ca grave threat to the integrity of the election and to our very democracy.\u201d The agency in the meantime is now seeking a short-term, end-of-the-year rate increase, according to a notice filed Friday with the Postal Regulatory Commission. The reasons: increased expenses, heightened demand for online packages due to the coronavirus pandemic and an expected increase in holiday mail volume. The plan would raise prices on commercial domestic competitive parcels, including Priority Mail Express, Priority Mail, first-class package service, Parcel Select and Parcel Return Service. Most of the proposed increases would be less than 10%. They range from 24 cents for Parcel Select Service, which starts at $3.05, to a $1.50 increase for Priority Mail Express Commercial, which starts at $22.75. The regulatory commission is expected to decide on the proposals next month. The Postal Service is the country\u2019s most popular government agency with 91% of Americans having a favorable opinion of the service, according to a Pew Research Center Survey published in April. \u201cWhat concerns me is an all-out attack \u2014 they\u2019re not even hiding it \u2014 by the president of the United States to undermine the United States Postal Service, to underfund it, to allow a mega-donor leading it to overtly do things to slow down the mail,\u201d said Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J. Sanders was on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u2019\u2019 while Meadows and Booker appeared on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d"}]}
