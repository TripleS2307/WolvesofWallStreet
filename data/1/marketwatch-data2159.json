Japan\u2019s ruling Liberal Democratic Party was set to pick a new leader, who will by definition become the prime minister because of the party\u2019s control over the more powerful lower house of Parliament. Favored to win is veteran ruling party politician, Yoshihide Suga, who will continue Shinzo Abe\u2019s \u201cAbenomics\u201d policies of easy lending and deregulation. \u201cThat decision should not be market moving as we fully expect a steady hand to remain on the tiller of Abenomics. Mr. Suga has signalled that no further rises in sales tax are on the horizon, but all else should stay the same,\u201d said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at Oanda. \u201cOf more interest will be if Mr. Suga signals that a new election will be held to mandate his new government,\u201d Halley said. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 NIK, -0.11% gained 0.7%. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng HSI, -0.30% gained nearly 1%, while the Shanghai Composite SHCOMP, +1.67% rose 0.6%. Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 XJO, +0.00% added 0.6% while South Korea\u2019s Kospi 180721, +0.21% jumped 1%. Stocks were about flat in Singapore STI, -0.39% , but rose in Taiwan Y9999, +1.10% and Indonesia JAKIDX, +0.28% . SoftBank 9984, -1.24% , which announced Sunday that it was selling Britain\u2019s Arm Holdings to computer graphics chip company Nvidia NVDA, -0.54% for $40 billion, jumped 9.4% in morning trading. SoftBank spent $32 billion to acquire Arm in 2016. Nvidia is best known for its graphics processing chips, while Arm is renowned as an innovator in the \u201cInternet of Things.\u201d Also on players\u2019 radar screen is the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee, which is meeting later in the week. The Federal Reserve\u2019s massive aid for the economy has helped underpin the markets\u2019 recovery from the coronavirus downturn by slashing short-term interest rates to record lows and buying up bonds to support markets. The Bank of Japan also is due to hold a policy meeting this week. No major changes are expected in its ultra-lax monetary policies. Stephen Innes, chief global market strategist at AxiCorp, noted that investors face \u201cmany uncertainties,\u201d including the U.S. elections and the global pandemic. \u201cUnquestionably the virus story is the dominant macro pivot event, especially for equities, and is more likely to be dominated by optimism surrounding a vaccine. Indeed investors will be keeping their eye on the vaccine prize,\u201d he said. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% rose 1.78, or 0.1%, to 3,340.97 after a day of the lightning-quick shifts in momentum that have rocked Wall Street recently. The Nasdaq composite COMP, +1.39% , which includes many of the superstar tech stocks that have been the focus of the market\u2019s recent selling, lost 0.6% to 10,853.55 after also flip-flopping between gains and losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% rose 0.5%, to 27,665.64. Analysts expect swings to continue to rattle markets for weeks, if not months, as investors wait for more clarity on several key issues. At the head of the list of uncertainties is what to do with Big Tech stocks, which critics have long said were due for a slide after soaring too high through the summer. In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude US:CLV20 rose 12 cents to $37.45 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude UK:BRNX20 , the international standard, stood unchanged at $39.83 a barrel. The U.S. dollar USDJPY, -0.38% inched down to 106.12 Japanese yen from 106.16 yen on Friday."}]}
