Bezos, Zuckerberg and Pichai each have agreed to testify as long as the other tech CEOs take part as well, and making their appearances contingent on the other companies could provide them with a way to back out, said a Politico report. Apple AAPL, +1.74% \u00c2 told the committee that it would send a senior executive but it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t clearly commit to having Cook appear, said a Washington Post report. Large technology companies have been skirmishing with U.S. antitrust regulators for some time amid escalating investigations, but investors largely haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t blinked. Some analysts have said the \u00e2\u0080\u009cexistence of so many disparate critiques\u00e2\u0080\u009d in Washington against Silicon Valley \u00e2\u0080\u009ccomplicates making progress on any one issue.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}]}
