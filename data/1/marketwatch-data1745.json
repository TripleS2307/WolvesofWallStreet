Bezos, Zuckerberg and Pichai each have agreed to testify as long as the other tech CEOs take part as well, and making their appearances contingent on the other companies could provide them with a way to back out, said a Politico report. Apple AAPL, +1.74%  told the committee that it would send a senior executive but it didn't clearly commit to having Cook appear, said a Washington Post report. Large technology companies have been skirmishing with U.S. antitrust regulators for some time amid escalating investigations, but investors largely haven't blinked. Some analysts have said the \"existence of so many disparate critiques\" in Washington against Silicon Valley \"complicates making progress on any one issue.\""}]}
