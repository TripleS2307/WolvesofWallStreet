In a note to developers, the iPhone maker said it would \u201cgive developers time to make necessary changes and apps will be required to obtain permission to track users starting early next year.\u201d Facebook, and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in particular, vociferously complained that changes to the iOS 14 operating system would leave one of its mobile advertising tools \u201cso ineffective on iOS 14 that it may not make sense to offer it.\u201d Digital advertising firms have dreaded the planned privacy changes that would require them to explain in their notifications why they are seeking tracking permissions. They expect most consumers would decline to grant permission. \u201cThis is good news for our clients who have spent weeks scrambling to prepare for changes with little to no concrete information,\u201d Adam Landis, CEO of mobile-analytics company AdLibertas Inc. told MarketWatch. \u201cThe rumored push-back of six months will be hugely beneficial for the app developers to better prepare for these massive changes.\u201d In a punishing day for technolgy stocks, Facebook FB, +0.26% shares declined 3.8% and Apple AAPL, +1.74% plunged 8% in its worst trading day since March."}]}
