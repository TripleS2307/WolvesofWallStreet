After a 0.6% advance on Wednesday, the Stoxx Europe 600 SXXP, +0.55% fell 0.7%. The aviation sector had another rough day, with Rolls-Royce RR, +14.25%, International Airlines Group IAG, -3.72% and Airbus AIR, -0.20% retreating. The German DAX DAX, +0.06%, French CAC 40 PX1, +0.71% and U.K. FTSE 100 UKX, +0.64% each declined. U.S. stocks had a rough Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% retreating 525 points. Stock futures YM00, +0.82% NQ00, +1.63% were lower on Thursday as well. U.S. jobless claims rose by 4,000, according to the latest data from the Labor Department. Economists at Goldman Sachs cut their U.S. growth forecast for the fourth quarter in half, to 3% from 6%. \u201cWe think it is now clear that Congress will not attach additional fiscal stimulus to the continuing resolution. This implies that after a final round of extra unemployment benefits that is currently being disbursed, any further fiscal support will likely have to wait until 2021,\u201d the economists said. The continuing resolution is a reference to the extension of funding beyond the September-ending fiscal year, which the U.S. House has already passed. Germany\u2019s Ifo business climate index rose a fifth month, according to data released on Thursday that was very close to economist expectations, while U.K. Chancellor Rishi Sunak rolled out a new program to replace the expiring job furlough program, which will pay part of the cost for employees working at least one-third their previous hours. Ajay Rajadhyaksha, a New York-based strategist for U.K. bank Barclays, told clients that \u201cthe valuation gap between growth and value equities is now at such an extreme that value stocks offer positive asymmetry on the next leg of the recovery, which should help European and other non-U.S. indices.\u201d Bucking the broader trend, some hard-hit financials rose. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria BBVA, -1.84%, UniCredit UCG, -1.68% and NatWest Group NWG, -0.35% each advanced. Of stocks on the move, Suez SEV, -0.62% shares fell 4% after its board of directors announced moves that seek to prevent a sale of its water subsidiary Suez Eau France, as part of Suez\u2019s broader resistance to a takeover from Veolia Environnement VIE, -0.92%. Smiths Group SMIN, +1.08% shares dropped 8%. The U.K. engineering group reinstated its dividend as its pretax profit from continuing operations slumped due to the planned separation of Smiths Medical as well as a new write-down. Analysts at Barclays said even though the firm didn\u2019t provide guidance, its own estimates of a 5% organic sales decline and steady margins of 15% seem \u201cachievable\u201d after the results. Pets At Home PETS, -1.38% shares rose 24%, as the U.K. pet supplies retailer said underlying pretax profits would be ahead of the \u00a373 million consensus. It said it had double-digit like-for-like sales growth through the eight weeks to Sept. 10."}]}
