Trump also claimed anew \u2014 falsely \u2014 that Democrats were pushing for universal mail-in voting and predicted without providing evidence that mail-in voting would lead to massive voter fraud in the November election. Polls indicate Trump is in for a tough re-election fight against Democrat Joe Biden. The Republican president said on Fox Business Network that among the big sticking points for a new congressional virus relief package were the Democrats\u2019 demands for billions of dollars to assist states in protecting the election and to help postal workers process mail-in ballots. Key Words: Trump blasts Democratic demands for postal-service money, saying mail-in voting would be \u2018fraudulent\u2019 Biden, responding during a meeting in Delaware on the coronavirus, told reporters the comments were, \u201cPure Trump. He doesn\u2019t want an election.\u201d Key Words (April 2020):White House officials may or may not explicitly threatened a veto but made clear Trump\u2019s opposition to the inclusion in the CARES Act of post-office rescue funds Trump said on Fox\u2019s \u201cMornings with Maria\u201d: \u201cThey need that money in order to have the post office work so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots.\u201d He added, \u201cIf they don\u2019t get those two items, that means you can\u2019t have universal mail-in voting because they\u2019re not equipped to have it.\u201d Trump has moved to sow public distrust in the Postal Service\u2019s ability to deliver what is expected to be record numbers of mail-in ballots. The agency\u2019s new leader, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a major donor to Trump and other Republicans, has instituted operational changes that have led to delivery delays across the U.S. For Democrats, Trump\u2019s new remarks were a clear admission that the president is attempting to restrict voting rights. \u201cThe President of the United States is sabotaging a basic service that hundreds of millions of people rely upon, cutting a critical lifeline for rural economies and for delivery of medicines, because he wants to deprive Americans of their fundamental right to vote safely during the most catastrophic public health crisis in over 100 years,\u201d Biden spokesperson Andrew Bates said in a statement. Letter carriers load mail-delivery trucks last month at a U.S. Postal Service facility in McLean, Va. Associated Press Negotiations over a new virus relief package have all but ended, with the White House and congressional leaders far apart on the size, scope and approach for shoring up households, reopening schools and launching a national strategy to contain the coronavirus. While there is some common ground over $100 billion for schools and new funds for virus testing, Democrats also want other emergency funds that Trump rejects. \u201cThey want $3.5 billion for something that will turn out to be fraudulent. That\u2019s election money, basically,\u201d Trump said during Thursday\u2019s call-in interview.

That figure, which would include money to help with election mail, is down from a $25 billion plan in a House-passed coronavirus measure. DeJoy, who was tapped to head the Postal Service by a Trump-appointed board of governors and started in June, has said that the agency is in a financially untenable position, but he maintains that it can handle this year\u2019s election mail. He is the first postmaster general in nearly two decades who is not a career postal employee. \u201cAlthough there will likely be an unprecedented increase in election mail volume due to the pandemic, the Postal Service has ample capacity to deliver all election mail securely and on-time in accordance with our delivery standards, and we will do so,\u201d he told the Postal Service\u2019s governing board last week. Memos obtained by the Associated Press show that Postal Service leadership has pushed to eliminate overtime and halt late delivery trips that are sometimes needed to ensure mail arrives on time, measures that postal workers and union officials say are delaying service. Additional records detail cuts to hours at post offices, including reductions on Saturdays and during lunch hours.

The Postal Service has warned the electoral battleground states Michigan and Pennsylvania that the time frames set forth in their absentee-voter rules may not be realistic given the post office\u2019s mail-delivery capacities, ABC News and others have reported. North Carolina, Minnesota and Maine, too, have been warned by the Postal Service\u2019s general counsel that voters could comply with state requirements but still not have their ballots returned in time to be counted due to USPS limitations, MSNBC reported Friday. Later Friday the Washington Post reported that 46 states and the District of Columbia had all received such warnings from the Postal Service. See:Postal Service is warning 46 states about mail voting delays, report says Democrats, and a handful of Republicans, have sent DeJoy several letters asking him to reverse his changes and criticizing what they say is a lack of openness by he agency. Late Wednesday, Senate Democrats again wrote DeJoy, this time saying he is pushing state election officials to opt for pricier first-class postage for mail-in ballots to be prioritized. \u201cInstead of taking steps to increase your agency\u2019s ability to deliver for the American people, you are implementing policy changes that make matters worse, and the Postal Service is reportedly considering changes that would increase costs for states at a time when millions of Americans are relying on voting by mail to exercise their right to vote,\u201d the Democrats wrote. A spokesman for the Postal Service, David Partenheimer, said in a statement that \u201ccertain deadlines concerning mail-in ballots, may be incompatible with the Postal Service\u2019s delivery standards,\u201d especially if election officials don\u2019t pay more for first-class postage. \u201cTo the extent that states choose to use the mail as part of their elections, they should do so in a manner that realistically reflects how the mail works,\u201d he said. Judy Beard, legislative and political director for the American Postal Workers Union, said postal workers are up to the task of delivering mail-in ballots this year. \u201cWe definitely know that the president is absolutely wrong concerning vote-by-mail,\u201d she said. Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., chair of the House subcommittee on government operations, said Trump is acknowledging that he wants to hold up funding for the U.S. Postal Service to hinder Americans from voting. \u201cThe president admits his motive for holding USPS funding hostage is that he doesn\u2019t want Americans to vote by mail,\u201d Connolly said in a statement Thursday. \u201cWhy? It hurts his electoral chances. He\u2019s putting self-preservation ahead of public safety, for an election he deserves to lose.\u201d MarketWatch contributed."}]}
