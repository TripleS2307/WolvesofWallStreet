The petition says Cohen's First Amendment rights are being violated, CNN reported, and claims the Justice Department is attempting to silence him. The American Civil Liberties Union joined the lawsuit. Cohen has reportedly been in solitary confinement since being returned to prison earlier this month for allegedly violating terms of his parole. He had been freed May 21 to serve out his sentence at home, due to the coronavirus pandemic."}]}
