At a Wednesday briefing, Trump disputed comments made earlier in the day by Robert Redfield, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who told Congress that a vaccine may not be available to the general public until well into next year. Redfield also said a face mask could be \u201cmore guaranteed to protect me against Covid than when I take a Covid vaccine.\u201d \u201cAs soon as it\u2019s announced, we\u2019ll be able to start,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019ll be from mid-October on \u2014 maybe a little bit later than that. We\u2019ll be all set so as soon as it\u2019s given the go-ahead \u2014 they\u2019re doing trials, as you know \u2014 so as soon as it\u2019s given the go-ahead, we will get it out, defeat the virus.\u201d It\u2019s not the first time that Trump has contradicted his own health experts. \u201cI believe he was confused,\u201d the president said about Redfield. Trump also again mocked his presidential opponent, Democrat Joe Biden, for wearing a face mask in public. See:Coronavirus vaccine likely to be unavailable to most Americans until well into 2021 His comments again raised concerns that science and health experts and the agencies they work for are being undermined and politicized during the current administration. They come just a day after the news that Michael Caputo, the assistant secretary of health for public affairs, will take a 60-day leave of absence \u201cto focus on his health and the well-being of his family,\u201d a statement from the Department of Health and Human Services said.

HHS also said Dr. Paul Alexander, who reportedly pressured officials to alter a key CDC report, is leaving the department. World Health Organization head of emergencies Mike Ryan told reporters at a Thursday briefing that it\u2019s important to have \u201cconsistent messaging\u201d from all levels by top officials. \u201cIt isn\u2019t easy for everyone to be on message all the time,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWhat is important is that governments, scientific institutions, step back, review the evidence, and give the most comprehensive, easy-to-understand-and-digest information so that people can take the appropriate action.\u201d The public need to understand that means complying with all of the measures recommended by health experts, from frequent hand washing to social distancing and wearing a face mask, said Ryan. Dr. Vin Gupta, affiliate assistant professor of Health Metrics Sciences at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington, agreed. \u201cThe science is that if 95% of Americans wore masks, we would follow the trajectory of Hong Kong, or these places that were puddle jumps from Wuhan, and have not experienced nearly what we\u2019ve experienced,\u201d he told MSNBC in an interview. The U.S. now has \u201cdefinitive proof\u201d of what Trump knew in February, said Gupta, namely that the virus was airborne. \u201cThat should trigger (the response) to ensure not only that every American has access to a mask, but to one that is well fitting and high quality,\u201d said Gupta. The president tried to pin the blame for total COVID-19 deaths on \u201cblue states,\u201d arguing if you take out such areas \u2014 which include many of the largest cities by population, such as New York and Los Angeles \u2014 the death count would be far lower. He again urged Democratic governors to reopen their states. But about 47% of COVID-19 deaths have occurred in red states, versus 53% in blue states, according to the Washington Post. Over time, the blue states that were early hot spots, have succeeded in containing the spread, and are seeing fewer hospitalizations and deaths. Since mid-June, the majority of new deaths are occurring in red states, where governors moved fast to reopen for business. The University of Washington\u2019s Institute on Health Metrics is expecting nearly 413,000 deaths by year-end, half of which are expected to occur in red states. In other news: \u2022 The WHO is warning of \u201calarming rates of transmission\u201d of COVID-19 across Europe and cautioned governments against shortening quarantine periods, Agence France-Presse reported. Hans Kluge, WHO head of Europe, said rising infections \u201cshould serve as a wake-up call for all of us.\u201d Kluge said the WHO is sticking with its guidance for individuals to quarantine for 14 days if exposed to the coronavirus. France has reduced the recommended period for self-isolation to seven days, while the U.K. and Ireland have cut it to 10 days. \u2022 A new study has found that people of color are far more likely than white people to test positive for COVID-19, to be hospitalized and to die, supporting other research on the racial disparities among coronavirus patients. The study from the Kaiser Family Foundations\u2019 Epic Health Research Network analyzed the records of about 50 million patients across 21 states. \u201cAlthough there were not large differences in testing by race and ethnicity, among those tested, Hispanic patients were over two and a half times more likely to have a positive result (311 per 1,000) and Black and Asian patients were nearly twice as likely to test positive (219 and 220 per 1,000, respectively) compared to White patients (113 per 1,000),\u201d the study found. \u2022 China has locked down a city located on the border with Myanmar and started a campaign to test the entire population of more than 200,000 people, the Guardian reported. The move comes after two new cases surfaced among travelers from Myanmar. Residents have been ordered to stay at home and checkpoints have been set up to stop people entering or leaving. \u2022 Just one day after officials said they are planning to lock down poorer neighborhoods in Madrid to stem the spread of infections, plans have changed, the Guardian reported. The justice minister in the Madrid regional government, Enrique Lopez, said today the word confinement \u201cgenerates anxiety\u201d and stressed that the government planned only to \u201creduce mobility and contacts\u201d in areas with a high rate of infections but would not lock them down.Latest tallies There are now 29.9 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University, and 942,631 people have died. At least 20.4 million have recovered, the data show. The U.S. has the highest tallies in the world with 6.6 million cases and 197,223 deaths. Brazil has the second highest death toll at 134,106 and third highest case tally at 4.4 million. India is third with 83,198 deaths and second with 5.1 million cases. Mexico is fourth with 71,978 deaths and seventh with 680,931 cases. The U.K. has 41,794 deaths and 384,075 cases, the highest death toll in Europe and fifth-highest in the world.

LLY, +2.20% and Amgen Inc. AMGN, -1.41% will collaborate on COVID-19 antibody treatments as a way to significantly boost global supply capacity. The announcement comes a day after Lilly said interim data from a mid-stage clinical trial assessing its experimental antibody treatment reduced the rate of hospitalization as well as viral load in some COVID-19 patients. The investigational therapy, LY-CoV555, is produced using neutralizing antibodies gathered from patients who have recovered from COVID-19. The ongoing, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study is expected to enroll a total of 800 participants, all of whom have mild to moderate symptoms and are being treated with LY-CoV555 in an outpatient setting. \u201cThrough this collaboration, the two companies will have the ability to quickly scale up production and serve many more patients around the world should one or more of Lilly\u2019s antibody therapies prove successful in clinical testing and receive regulatory approval,\u201d Lilly and Agmen said in a joint statement.

The number of Americans who applied for unemployment benefits through state and federal programs fell in September for the first time in five weeks, but initial jobless claims are still very high and point to ongoing job losses due to the coronavirus pandemic, MarketWatch\u2019s Jeffry Bartash reported. Initial jobless claims filed traditionally through state employment offices fell to 860,000 in the week of Sept. 6 to Sept. 11, the Labor Department said Thursday. Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast new claims to fall to 870,000. New claims also fell for the first time since mid-August if self-employed workers who applied for benefits under a separate federal program are included. Some 658,737 people filed under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance Act. See also:Stock markets have now seen the \u2018peak of Fed stimulus\u2019 unless these 2 things happen That put the number of actual or unadjusted new claims at 1.45 million, compared to 1.73 million in the prior week. Federal filings declined for the first time in five weeks. The labor market continues to heal from the viral recession, but unemployment remains extremely elevated and will remain a problem for at least a couple of years,\u201d said chief economist Gus Faucher of PNC Financial Services in Pittsburgh. \u201cWith initial claims at almost four times their pace before the pandemic, layoffs are far higher than normal.\u201d Separately, The Philadelphia Fed said its gauge of business activity in its region dipped in September. The regional Fed bank\u2019s index fell to 15 from 17.2 in August. Any reading above zero indicates improving conditions. This is the fourth straight positive reading. Economists polled by MarketWatch expected a 13 reading.
