Major U.S. benchmarks have suffered three consecutive weekly losses.What drove the market? Stocks ended lower to start the week but it could have been worse, as a late-session rally helped to mitigate some of the day\u2019s worst selling and avoid bearish patterns crystallize in some of the major benchmarks and assets. Helping to catalyze the slump was U.S. and European equities tumbling as a rising number of COVID-19 cases across several European economies sparked fears of renewed restrictions on activity, a development that would slow the global economic recovery\u2019s pace. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said on Monday that he and local officials will propose a round of new restrictions to stem the coronavirus\u2019 spread. Pubs in England could be subject to early closes to tackle rising infections, while some bars and restaurants in hard-hit areas could be shut completely, according to a report from the Sun.

Equity markets already during the pandemic have been prone to powerful whipsaws. \u201cWith an equity market that\u2019s been stretched, it\u2019s not surprising to see a pullback,\u201d Kaprich said. \u201cWe went from big, big lows back to normal, not in years, but in months.\u201d See: Monday\u2019s stock-market selloff sets up worst September in 18 years Esty Dwek, head of global macro strategy for Natixis Investment Managers, said it would be important to see what Europe\u2019s climbing case count means to the economic recovery. \u201cData has basically stalled over the summer, so if [European policy makers] manage to keep activity going with \u2018minor\u2019 measures, data can hold up,\u201d she said in emailed comments. \u201cBut if the situation deteriorates further or self-discipline impacts growth even further, we could have a tougher few months for European assets.\u201d U.S. and European bank shares fell sharply after BuzzFeed News and other outlets published articles alleging that the world\u2019s most powerful banks continued doing business with customers they suspected of engaging in money laundering and other illicit activities. The SPDR Financial Select Sector ETF XLF, +0.11% dropped 2.8%. Shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM, -0.57%, which was mentioned in the investigative news report, fell 4.2%.

Tech-related stocks, which had led the market\u2019s rally back from the March pandemic lows, have flagged in recent weeks, leading the market back down from all-time highs. But Monday\u2019s selloff was led by more growth-sensitive sectors, reflecting the fickle swings in market expectations around an uncertain U.S. economic recovery.

Other central bankers including New York Fed President John Williams will speak throughout the day.
