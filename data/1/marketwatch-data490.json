However, he'll no longer be the rocker-in-residence in this quiet Southern California suburb if he has his way - he has recently put his Mediterranean-style mansion on the market for $5.7 million. Sixx purchased the 10,300-square-foot home in 2015 for $4,125,000, and proceeded to make it his own. However, his makeover isn't exactly what you might expect from the legendary rocker. The listing agent, Emil Hartoonian of The Agency, describes it this way: \"This home is special in many ways. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 [It has] a storybook presence, scaled with magnificent grandeur and flow. The home is a perfect haven for comfort, retreat, and inspiration.\" With its arched windows and doorways, coffered ceilings, crystal chandeliers, as well as inlaid wood and marble flooring, the rocker's estate is quite elegant.

This dedicated movie theater has a posh club vibe, thanks to its lush velvet recliners, tasteful animal-print carpeting, and stately office/studio and game areas. Plush theater realtor.com Studio realtor.com Game room realtor.com With five bedrooms and 6.5 bathrooms, there's plenty of room in the home to accommodate a large family or many guests-without the concern of prying eyes. It sits on a 1.2-acre lot behind the guarded gates of North Ranch Country Club Estates. The grounds include a pool and spa with multiple fountains, a substantial Mediterranean-style cabana with a fire pit, lush lawns, meticulously manicured box hedges and rosebushes, plus mature landscaping almost everywhere you look.

At present, he's making his home sweet home in Wyoming, after living in the Los Angeles area for 40 years. As he puts it on his Facebook page, \"Being relocated in Wyoming most of the time, I am feeling reconnected to some new creativity already. Right now, I am here to reset, restart and recreate. I am working on a book, a musical and awaiting a world tour with @motleycrue\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\" This story was originally published on Realtor.com"}]}
