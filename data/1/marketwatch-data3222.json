Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the right way to do it", "body": "What if you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pay the rent, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing in the fridge\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the only money you have is what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in your 401(k) or IRA? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a rhetorical question. Millions of Americans have been hammered by the pandemic-induced economic crash. GDP collapsed at a still-hard-to-believe 33% rate in the second quarter. Tens of millions of jobs have been lost. Up to 40 million Americans are at risk of eviction. Meanwhile, nearly 20% of households with kids report being unable to afford to give their children enough food. So what to do? One option for people lucky enough to have a 401(k) and/or an individual retirement account (IRA) could be to tap into them on a short-term basis, says Sally Brandon, senior vice president at Rebalance, an investment and retirement advisory firm. In the old days\u00e2\u0080\u0094as in before the pandemic changed everything\u00e2\u0080\u0094financial advisers like Brandon were pretty much unanimous in their view that you should only take an early withdrawal from your 401(k) or IRA account as a last resort. Not only were there stiff penalties and taxes, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d lose time for that money to compound. But now, Brandon acknowledges that \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour retirement savings may be the only lifeline you have\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that \u00e2\u0080\u009csome people might not have a choice\u00e2\u0080\u0094they may have to take money out right now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Fortunately, the federal government has eased its strict rules on early withdrawals from retirement accounts. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was passed by Congress with overwhelming, and bipartisan support and signed into law by President Trump in March; among other things, it eliminates the 10% early withdrawal penalty if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re younger than 59\u00c2\u00bd. The money is treated as income, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re allowed to spread the tax burden over 2020, 2021 and 2022 (the IRS also gives you the option of including the entire distribution in your income for the year of the distribution). If you absolutely must tap your retirement accounts, Brandon offers some useful advice here. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take out big sums of cash. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust because you can doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean you should,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cConsider taking out only a little bit at a time, and keep as much invested as you can.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Read: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a 57-year-old nurse with no savings and I want to retire in 7 years.
