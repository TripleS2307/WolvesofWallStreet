It went on to compare the U.S. administration to \u00e2\u0080\u009ca gangster forcing an unreasonable and unfair business deal on a legitimate company.\u00e2\u0080\u009d - The White House last weekend approved a deal that quickly showed the three signatory companies at odds over its interpretation. TikTok\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Chinese owner, ByteDance, said it would own 80% of a new TikTok Global entity, while Oracle and Walmart, its U.S. future partners, insisted instead that they will control the company. - Global Times, an English language version of the Communist Party newspaper People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Daily, also denounced the Trump-approved deal on Wednesday, proclaiming in a headline that China wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t \u00e2\u0080\u009callow the U.S. to rob TikTok.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The paper also quoted an expert describing Oracle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s founder Larry Ellison as \u00e2\u0080\u009cdefinitely an anti-China person.\u00e2\u0080\u009d - ByteDance chose database software company Oracle ORCL, +0.42% \u00c2 and retailer Walmart WMT, +1.00% \u00c2 over technology giant Microsoft MSFT, +2.48% \u00c2 when it was forced by Washington to hand over its U.S. operations under the threat of an outright ban. The U.S. government balked at a first version of the deal that kept the Chinese in control of the popular videosharing app. - \u00e2\u0080\u009cEven if it means TikTok could be shut down complete in the U.S., China will not sit idle and allow the U.S. government to seize a Chinese asset so brazenly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Global Times warned.

But it is still hard to tell whether the Chinese media editorials signal Beijing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s outright opposition to any form of agreement, or whether they just amount to a bit of saber-rattling before another compromise is found. However important it has become to the online lives of American and European teenagers, and to President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign against Chinese security threats, TikTok isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen by analysts as crucial to Beijing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interests. And in any case, the dispute about its ownership must be placed in the overall context of the tense and deteriorating U.S.-China relations.
