Getty Images The battle over the replacement of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has refocused American attention on the future of the Affordable Care Act. The Supreme Court is\u00c2 scheduled to hear oral arguments Nov. 10 in a case seeking to overturn the law\u00c2 that brought insurance coverage to\u00c2 millions of Americans. Meanwhile, Trump recently released his \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmerica-First Healthcare Plan.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In it, the president claims significant achievements. He also outlines broad principles of his vision for the future of health care in America. Over the past three years, the Trump administration has taken a number of steps to dismantle pieces of the ACA. And his recently introduced executive order\u00c2 lacks a number of key details\u00c2 and the\u00c2 legal grounds for enacting much of the proposal. The two factors leave me \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a\u00c2 health policy and politics scholar who\u00c2 has closely followed the Affordable Care Act\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 skeptical about the emergence of a\u00c2 meaningful replacement\u00c2 to the ACA that would expand insurance access should the Supreme Court invalidate the\u00c2 Obama administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s signature achievement.Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s moves on health care President Trump campaigned and entered office with the pledge to \u00e2\u0080\u009crepeal and replace\u00e2\u0080\u009d the ACA. In his own words, there would be a \u00e2\u0080\u009creally great HealthCare Plan with far lower premiums (costs) & deductibles\u00e2\u0080\u009d right after the election. Since 2016, Congress has made little headway besides eliminating the ACA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s penalty for not carrying insurance. This is the basis for the\u00c2 current lawsuit\u00c2 to be heard before the Supreme Court in November.\u00c2 The argument is\u00c2 that because Congress did away with the penalty, the individual mandate can no longer be constitutionally justified as a tax. As a result, the entire law should fall. While Republicans have been unable to repeal the law, the Trump administration has taken a number of\u00c2 executive actions to limit its reach. In combination, these efforts have contributed to bringing the uninsured rate to\u00c2 14% by 2019 from a low of 11% in 2016. This leaves millions of Americans without coverage and exposed to medical bills should they fall ill. One of the major targets of the Trump administration has been reducing enrollment through the\u00c2 ACA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s marketplaces. Here, the administration\u00c2 shortened the periods in which people are allowed to purchase insurance\u00c2 and drastically\u00c2 reduced funding for individuals who help consumers enroll in coverage as well as advertising. It also\u00c2 withheld subsidies\u00c2 to support low-income individuals with out-of-pocket costs, which also caused problems to insurers offering plans to those people. The administration has also worked to expand alternative insurance plans like so-called\u00c2 short-term, limited-duration health plans\u00c2 and\u00c2 association health plans. While these plans have lower premiums, they do not carry the consumer protections of the ACA like preexisting condition coverage. They also do not pay for prescription drugs or hospital stays. And unlike the ACA, they also require consumers to undergo a medical assessment before enrollment. Consumers may be charged higher premiums or rejected entirely based on their medical condition and age. Regulations issued by the Trump administration have reduced access to\u00c2 reproductive care for women. The administration has also pushed states to implement\u00c2 work requirements for Medicaid beneficiaries\u00c2 and\u00c2 discourage immigrants from enrolling\u00c2 in Medicaid for fear of being denied permanent residency. As a result,\u00c2 thousands of individuals have become uninsured. Even on one of the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s favorite topics, reducing the cost of prescription drugs, numerous initiatives regarding\u00c2 generic drugs, drug importation and capping insulin prices\u00c2 for Medicare beneficiaries\u00c2 have done very little to reduce cost or improve access. On one of the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other priorities, eliminating\u00c2 surprise bills\u00c2 for medical services that patients unexpectedly receive for care that they reasonably thought would be covered by their insurance, the administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions have yet to have a\u00c2 meaningful effect.Executive order When it comes to Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s executive order, the topic that received the most public attention \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the guarantee that \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmericans with pre-existing conditions can obtain the insurance of their choice at affordable rates\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 carries no legal weight nor clear explanation of how it would be achieved or funded. More generally,\u00c2 after years of promising a detailed plan, the\u00c2 America-First Healthcare Plan\u00c2 focuses primarily on past actions. It also spends just 491 words on laying out a set of objectives \u00e2\u0080\u0094 lower costs, better care and more choice \u00e2\u0080\u0094 yet does not provide a mechanism or road map for how to implement them. All this leads me to believe that if the ACA is overturned before the Supreme Court, the prospect of substantive replacement that seeks to expand care to more Americans is unlikely.
