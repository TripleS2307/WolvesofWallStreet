Is that accurate? As Biden prepares to accept the presidential nomination on Thursday, give Trump partial credit for spotting a leftward tilt by the former vice president. But only partial. Biden has indeed moved to the left in some of his policy proposals. Yet on others, the 77-year-old veteran Democrat hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t budged. Having fought a bitter primary-season battle with progressives Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, Biden wound up adopting some of those senators\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ideas. For example, Biden added to his own agenda Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal to make public college tuition-free for students whose families make less than $125,000. He backed Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plan to make it easier to file for bankruptcy. And Biden recently rolled out an environmental plan that was more aggressive than what he proposed during the campaign. See:Biden calls for $2 trillion in clean-energy spending and zero power-plant emissions by 2035. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s moved on some issues quite decidedly to the left,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Larry Jacobs, a political scientist at the University of Minnesota. But Biden hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t gone as far as some policies in the Green New Deal, the climate-change-fighting plan of progressives such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. While his running mate Sen. Kamala Harris said last year during a debate that there was \u00e2\u0080\u009cno question\u00e2\u0080\u009d she was in favor of banning fracking, Biden would do that only for oil and gas production from federal lands. And the former vice president hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t signed on to Medicare for All, preferring instead to build on the Affordable Care Act that became law under President Barack Obama. Now read:Are Democrats wavering on oil subsidies? Biden-Harris climate platform remains fluid. Still, Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s line of attack is to paint the longtime Democrat as an extremist. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJoe Biden and Kamala Harris would DESTROY America,\u00e2\u0080\u009d read a Trump campaign fundraising email on Monday, the day the Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 convention kicked off. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTheir Socialist Convention this week is only a preview of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to come,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the campaign said. Trump is spending the week lobbing such attacks in four battleground states, counterprogramming the convention. Watch:Joe Biden officially nominated by virtual roll call at DNC. Trump, facing unemployment of more than 10% as the coronavirus continues to wrack the U.S. economy, claims that Biden and Harris would sink stocks SPX, +0.87% \u00c2 and even cause a depression via their economic policies, such as raising the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% and imposing higher rates on individuals. Wall Street analysts offer a much more nuanced picture. At least one has said another Trump term has the potential to cause a double-dip recession if the coronavirus crisis is mishandled. And analysts say there are sector winners and losers under a potential Biden presidency, with utilities and health care poised to benefit, and energy and financials possibly suffering. Barron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s:How a Biden win would affect different market sectors \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and stock picks for both election outcomes. To be sure, Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to make sweeping policy changes in health care or tax policy would depend on the makeup of Congress. Republicans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued hold on the Senate could stymie major ambitions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but the GOP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ceding the chamber to Democrats would open a path for Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plans, especially with a Democratic-controlled House. A tug of war over Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policies appears poised to continue if he gets elected. Speaking at the Democratic convention on Monday night, former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a Republican, argued against those in his party and independents who worry that Biden \u00e2\u0080\u009cmay turn sharp left and leave them behind.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo one pushes Joe around.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Some activists, meanwhile, say they intend to try to do just that. Varshini Prakash, co-founder of the climate-advocacy group the Sunrise Movement, called Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to stop fracking on federal lands \u00e2\u0080\u009ca strong step,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but said the former vice president can go much farther on issues affecting the environment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo matter what, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re got to push Joe Biden to increase and improve his ambition,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Prakash, whose organization wants to \u00e2\u0080\u009cmake the Green New Deal the law of the land,\u00e2\u0080\u009d told MarketWatch."}]}
