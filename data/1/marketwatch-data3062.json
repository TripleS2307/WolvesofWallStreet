Will it be a quick V-shaped recovery, or a long period between the decline and subsequent recovery (a U-shape)? Other possible recovery shapes have been likened to the letters \u00e2\u0080\u009cW\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cL.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In truth, this alphabet soup \u00e2\u0080\u009cultimately matters very little,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to Vincent Deluard, head of global macro strategy at investment firm INTL FCStone. In an email, he said that investors should not be discouraged by this, because, he notes, \u00e2\u0080\u009ceconomic forecasting, a perilous exercise at the best of times, is even more futile today: we have no idea whether there will be a second wave of infections or not, inflation or deflation, a balance sheet recession or a debt jubilee etc.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Therefore, knowing that forecasts don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make much a different to our investment strategies should be reassuring.

That implies an incredible level of clairvoyance, of course, since it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s well after a given quarter has ended that the government arrives at that quarter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s final GDP number. Yet Deluard found that this hypothetical investor, despite possessing amazing clairvoyance, would have barely beaten a simple buy-and-hold strategy over the past seven decades. Specially, he assumed that this investor would be 100% invested if GDP growth four quarters hence was faster than in the current quarter; otherwise he would invest in cash. Since the late 1940s, this investor would have beaten the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% \u00c2 by less than an annualized percentage point. That is an awfully small reward for being a perfect forecaster, especially since the odds are overwhelming that our forecasts will fall far, far short of being perfect. Consider what Deluard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s findings mean for our current uncertain situation, in which we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really know how fast the economy is growing. But we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have very little leg up on our fellow investors even if we knew now that economic growth would be accelerating in the second quarter of 2021. Why does knowledge of the economy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future growth rate matter so little? Deluard argues that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because profit margins and P/E ratios matter a lot more. The economy can be growing at a fast clip, after all, but if profit margins are shrinking that growth won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t translate into earnings growth. And fast-growing earnings can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always overcome a shrinking P/E ratio. This outsized role that the P/E ratio plays relates to the discount rate that investors use \u00e2\u0080\u0094 either explicitly or implicitly \u00e2\u0080\u0094 when valuing companies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 future earnings. With a high discount rate, future years\u00e2\u0080\u0099 earnings mean relatively little to a company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current valuation. With a low discount rate, they matter a lot more. Indeed, Deluard recently showed that, depending on the discount rate used, the S&P 500 now is fairly valued anywhere between 1,851 and 3,386. No wonder, as Deluard put it, knowing in advance the GDP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growth rate is \u00e2\u0080\u009cremarkably useless.\u00e2\u0080\u009d None of this is to say that the economy doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter. It very much does, of course. But its impact is greatest when focusing on the stock market over the long term. Over shorter periods, the economy plays a lesser role than profit margins and valuation-linked discount rates. This discussion also puts into perspective the recent debate about the apparent disconnect between the stock market and the economy. What Deluard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s research shows is that this disconnect is neither new nor particularly larger now than in years past. Mark Hulbert is a regular contributor to MarketWatch.
