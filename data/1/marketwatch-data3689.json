(AP) \u2014 The coronavirus may be changing the world, but there aren\u2019t many signs of the pandemic at the massive annual motorcycle rally being held this week at a small city along Interstate 90 in western South Dakota. The scene Saturday at the 80th Sturgis Motorcycle Rally was familiar to veterans of the event, with throngs of maskless bikers packing the streets. Motorcyclist Kevin Lunsmann, 63, rode more than 600 miles to the rally from Big Lake, Minn., with several friends. Lunsmann said he has attended the Sturgis event every year since 2003 and didn\u2019t want to miss the 80th, despite being \u201csomewhat\u201d concerned about the coronavirus. Still, the crowds of people and rows of bikes surprised him. He said there was no difference from previous years \u201cother than a few people wearing masks.\u201d See:U.S. coronavirus infections now exceed 5 million \u201c \u2018Screw COVID. I went to Sturgis.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 T-shirt on sale at event Lunsmann said he was avoiding the bars and nightclubs that line the city\u2019s main drag this year, but many others were not. They were filled with revelers as the sun set Friday. \u201cEverybody\u2019s still partying hardy,\u201d Lunsmann said. Organizers expected the overall crowd to be smaller, perhaps half the size of a normal year, when some half-million people from across the country roar into a town whose population is around 7,000. The sheer numbers raise the prospect that this year\u2019s rally could spread the COVID-19 virus in a state with no special limits on indoor crowds, no mask mandates, and a governor who is eager to welcome visitors and their money. \u201cScrew COVID,\u201d read the design on one T-shirt being hawked at the event. \u201cI went to Sturgis.\u201d Bob Graham, 71, was one of the few people wearing masks as he walked along Main Street. \u201cWe don\u2019t want the virus. We want to come up here a few more years yet,\u201d Graham said. Graham made his 36th annual trip to Sturgis from Central City, Neb., with his wife, calling it \u201ckind of like our therapy for the year.\u201d For Stephen Sample, who rode his Harley from Arizona, the event was a break from the routine of the last several months, when he\u2019s been mostly homebound or wearing a mask when he went to work as a surveyor. \u201cI don\u2019t want to die, but I don\u2019t want to be cooped up all my life either,\u201d he said. People crowded around bars in Sturgis, S.D., on Friday. Associated Press Sample was aware his trip to the rally could end in the hospital, which seemed to weigh on him. \u201cThis is a major experiment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could be a major mistake.\u201d Republican Gov. Kristi Noem has taken a largely hands-off approach to the pandemic, avoiding a mask mandate and preaching personal responsibility. She supported holding the rally. Daily virus cases have been trending upward in South Dakota, but the seven-day average is still only around 84, with fewer than two deaths per day. Sturgis officials plan to mass test residents to try to detect and halt outbreaks, but the area\u2019s largest hospital system is already burdened with the influx of tourists and bikers who inevitably need medical care during this time. Marsha Schmid, who owns the Side Hack Saloon in Sturgis, was trying to keep her bar and restaurant from becoming a virus hot spot by spacing out indoor tables and offering plenty of hand sanitizer. She also scaled back the number of bands hired for the rally, hoping the crowds would stay thin but still spend the cash that keeps her business viable for the rest of the year. \u201cYou\u2019ve got people coming from all over the world,\u201d she said. \u201cI just hope they are being responsible and if they don\u2019t feel good, they stay away.\u201d"}]}
