The rule, issued July 10, went into effect July 5. It tells hospitals to now report data to the Department of Health and Human Services rather than to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as they have done since March. The reporting change has been met with concern that the decision is politically motivated and there has been a lack of transparency about how the change will improve the government's data-gathering process. There are also worries that data about hospital capacity and other metrics used by researchers will no longer be made public. \"Governors are requesting a 30-day delay of these new requirements, in order for hospitals to learn a new system, as they continue to deal with this pandemic,\" the organization said Thursday. \"In addition, governors urge the administration to make this information publicly available.\""}]}
