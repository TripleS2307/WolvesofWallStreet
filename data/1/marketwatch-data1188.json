Kamala Harris of California to be his running mate, tapping a former rival in the Democratic presidential primary as he takes on Donald Trump for the White House. Harris, 55, drew praise last summer for her strong performance in the first Democratic presidential debate, when she attacked Biden for his stance decades ago on busing, but her 2020 campaign ultimately failed to get traction, leading her to exit the race in December. \u201cI have the great honor to announce that I\u2019ve picked @KamalaHarris \u2014 a fearless fighter for the little guy, and one of the country\u2019s finest public servants \u2014 as my running mate,\u201d Biden tweeted in making his announcement. He also invoked Harris\u2019s work with his late son Beau, the former attorney general of Delaware, and the pair\u2019s work \u201cas they took on the big banks,\u201d KBE, -0.69% and advocated for working people and women and children. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Harris brings law-enforcement experience to Biden\u2019s presidential bid, having served as California\u2019s attorney general and San Francisco\u2019s chief prosecutor before becoming a U.S. senator, though that record as a \u201ctop cop\u201d also has drawn criticism. Biden, who served as vice president in the Obama administration and as a U.S. senator from Delaware, had long said he would choose a woman as his running mate. The choice of Harris, who is Black, comes in the wake of nationwide protests over police killings of Black Americans.

Trump\u2019s campaign attacked Harris as embracing \u201cthe left\u2019s radical manifesto\u201d in her own campaign, and said she would bring the same agenda to Biden\u2019s ticket. \u201cJoe Biden is no moderate, and with Harris as his \u2018political living will,\u2019 he is surrendering control of our nation to the radical mob with promises to raise taxes, cut police funding, kill energy jobs, open our borders, and appease socialist dictators,\u201d said Katrina Pierson, a senior Trump adviser. The 77-year-old politician\u2019s age has prompted questions about whether he would serve two terms as president and put extra focus on his choice for vice president. Biden in late April said he viewed himself \u201cas a transition candidate\u201d who would have young leaders in his administration. Other Democratic politicians under consideration for the No. 2 job included former national-security adviser Susan Rice, Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Rep. Val Demings of Florida. One expert told MarketWatch in June that Wall Street SPX, +0.87% DJIA, +0.56% could have been shaken if Biden had picked Warren, who is known for taking on the financial sector and other parts of Corporate America."}]}
