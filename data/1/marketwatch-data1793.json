President Vladimir Putin announced the news of the vaccine at a government meeting, The Wall Street Journal reported, following accelerated trials conducted by the Gamaleya Institute for Epidemiology and Microbiology in Moscow in collaboration with the Defense Ministry. Putin said one of his daughters has already received a dose of the vaccine, which has been named Sputnik-V, referring to the satellite Russia launched into space during the Cold War, beating the U.S. to the punch. Russia has conducted just two trials of the vaccine, with a third planned after volunteers register. The normal approval process for a new medicine is to gather data from a Phase 1 and Phase 2 trial, and then expand the patient base to thousands in a Phase 3 trial to create enough evidence it is effective and safe. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are no Olympic medals for being first,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Matthew Schmidt, University of New Haven Associate Professor of National Security and Political Science and a Russia expert, in emailed comments. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCheating on the scientific process hurts the perception of vaccine safety everywhere. The goal isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t to be first, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to be first in a way that gives people faith in a vaccine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safety,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.

The list includes Pfizer Inc. PFE, -0.27% \u00c2 and partner BioNTech SE BNTX, +1.23%, Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +1.39%, Merck & Co. MRK, -0.14%, AstraZeneca PLC AZN, +1.16% \u00c2 AZN, +0.63% \u00c2 in combination with Oxford University, Moderna Inc. MRNA, +0.09%, Sanofi SAN, +1.20% \u00c2 and GlaxoSmithKline GSK, +1.10% GSK, +1.52%, among others. A vaccine would change the trajectory of the pandemic, allowing economies to fully reopen and people to return to work and school. But vaccine development is normally a lengthy process. Even PhRMA, the pharmaceutical industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest lobbying group, says vaccine development takes 10 years, and the chief executives of Novartis AG NVS, +0.97% \u00c2 and Johnson & Johnson, have said developing a COVID-19 vaccine will take longer than 12 months. At the same time, several companies developing COVID-19 vaccines have pledged millions and sometimes billions of doses of vaccines that have yet to prove their efficacy.

Barbosa said the vaccine should not be produced until Phase 3 trials have been completed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAny vaccine producer has to follow this procedure that guarantees it is safe and has the WHO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recommendation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Association of Clinical Trials Organizations, a nongovernmental agency, appeared to also have safety concerns Tuesday and asked the health minister in an open letter to delay registering the vaccine until all trials have been completed, The Wall Street Journal reported. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even completed testing with participation of even 100 people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the letter said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exactly in the course of that phase when proof of the effectiveness can be ascertained as well as information about undesirable reactions, which the vaccine can cause in various patient groups.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The data has not been peer-reviewed, according to media reports, another important step in achieving regulatory approval. Russia has not made data from the earlier trials public. Russia has 890,799 confirmed COVID-19 cases, fourth highest in the world, Johns Hopkins data shows, and at least 14,973 Russians have died. Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, said he would not take the Russian vaccine, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccertainly not outside of a clinical trial right now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In an interview with CNBC, Gottlieb said in addition to the limited number of patients involved in trials, it appears to be similar to a vaccine being developed by Chinese biotech CanSino which is currently in clinical trials in Canada. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEarly data on that vaccine is not very encouraging,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA lot of people had antibodies to the viral vector itself, so they effectively neutralized the viral vector, because it was based on a common cold.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not clear if the Russian trial will also find patients have prior immunity, he said. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Florian Krammer, professor of microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Mount Sinai Hospital, said he too would not take any vaccine that had not been thoroughly investigated. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot sure what Russia is up to but I certainly would not take a vaccine that hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been tested in Phase III,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said on Twitter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNobody knows if its safe or if it works. They are putting HCWs (health care workers) and their population at risk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Russia is planning to start inoculation with the vaccine in October and will offer voluntary vaccination to the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health care workers and teachers first. After that, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hoping to roll out the vaccine at home and overseas. Kirill Dmitriev, head of Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Direct investment Fund, which partnered with Gamaleya Institute for the vaccine, said Russia had already received requests from 20 countries, including Brazil, Indonesia, and the United Arab Emirates, the Journal reported. So far, Russia has orders for one billion doses of Sputnik-V, he said. Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center of Infection Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, reiterated his message that the virus has infected just 8% to 10% of Americans, but will not stop until at least 50% to 70% are infected. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can get there through natural disease, or we can get there through a vaccine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said in an interview on MSNBC. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t count on the vaccine yet being there, and so we have to come to grips with this virus. We have to learn how to deal with it. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not. we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ignoring it, thinking that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go away, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not going to happen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d See:Coronavirus update: U.S. case tally tops 5 million, more than one-quarter of the 20 million global cases"}]}
