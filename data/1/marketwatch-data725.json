But there's something else going on that points to a long-term trend investors need to know about: a housing shortage outside cities, and a boom in home renovation and improvement. It's understandable that at a time when people have to stay home that cloud-services providers such as Zoom Video Communications Inc. US:ZM  will soar. The stock is up 20% this month and 349% for 2020. The familiar FAANG stocks (plus Microsoft Corp. US:MSFT ) have also surged this year: Company Ticker Total return - 2020 Facebook Inc. Class A US:FB 43% Apple Inc. US:AAPL 71% Amazon.com Inc. US:AMZN 84% Netflix Inc. US:NFLX 62% Alphabet Inc. Class C US:GOOG 23% Alphabet Inc. Class A US:GOOGL 22% Microsoft Corp. US:MSFT 46%  Source: FactSet But variety is the spice of life - and an excellent tool to cut risk in your investment portfolio and avoid missing out on opportunities. As people are stuck inside, they are also improving their homes. Others are trying to move away from cities, leading to incredibly strong markets for home sellers in suburbs and rural areas. That points to a housing shortage and good times for home builders, suppliers to those builders and home-improvement retailers, including Home Depot Inc. US:HD  and Lowe's Cos. US:LOW. Digging further, consider a company such as Pool Corp. US:POOL, which bills itself as \"the world's largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies, equipment and related leisure products\" and has well over 100,000 wholesale customers. This stock is up 57% this year. It's easy to screen the broad indexes for home-builder stocks, but it is difficult to identify companies similar to Pool Corp. US:POOL, because a company's industry listing may be something vague like \"wholesale distributors\" within the consumer discretionary sector. Of course, an excellent way to play the home construction/renovation trend is through exchange traded funds that focus on appropriate industries. So we looked to three U.S. construction and home improvement-related ETFs, combined their holdings and removed their duplicates for a list of stocks. Here are the three ETFs: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00e2\u0080\u0089The iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF US:ITB  holds shares of home builders and companies that supply them, including the large home-improvement chains. The portfolio is weighted by market capitalization. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00e2\u0080\u0089The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF US:XHB holds an equal-weighted group of companies involved with home building and supplying builders. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00e2\u0080\u0089The Invesco Dynamic Building & Construction ETF US:PKB  holds 30 U.S. construction companies, and isn't focused only on home construction. Here's how the three ETFs have performed this year: FactSet Taking the three ETFs together and eliminating duplicate holdings, we are left with a group of 69 stocks, 42 of which have had double-digit returns this year. So here's the entire list, sorted by how well the stocks have performed this year.
