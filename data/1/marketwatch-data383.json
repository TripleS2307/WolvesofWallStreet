In its first Prime Day forecast, eMarketer expects sales of $9.91 billion, with U.S. sales coming in at $6.17 billion. Amazon AMZN, +3.01% Prime Day will take place on Oct. 13 and Oct. 14. It\u2019s usually a summertime event, but was delayed by the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cDespite an uncertain economy, consumers will continue to spend heavily on e-commerce and actively seek deals heading into the holiday season,\u201d eMarketer wrote. Amazon typically doesn\u2019t disclose sales numbers for the Prime Day event.

But we believe Amazon is well positioned to handle the holiday surge, with the company increasing warehouse square footage 50%\u2014including opening 100 new operations buildings in September\u2014and Amazon Logistics (AMZL) set to deliver more than 50% of all packages from Amazon fulfillment centers, thereby reducing dependence on third-party shippers.\u201d JPMorgan rates Amazon stock overweight with a price target of $4,050. One of the benefits to pushing back Prime Day to a period closer to the holiday season is that shoppers will be looking to purchase for themselves as well as for gifts. \u201cRetail therapy during COVID has been real, and consumers will likely indulge in products they will use now: electronics, kitchen appliances, and desk/office products,\u201d said Greg Portell, head of global consumer industries and retail at global management consulting firm Kearney. See: Barbie could be queen of the holiday season with analysts upbeat about Mattel and Hasbro \u201cWe anticipate a lift in at-home or cold weather activities, toys, and games, as consumers consider how they can stay entertained throughout the season, while apparel sales outside of athleisure will likely trail last year.\u201d Amazon released a new lineup of its Echo smart speakers and other devices late last month, which should also give the e-commerce giant a boost. Amazon has said after past Prime Days that Echo speakers were bestsellers. The company could also ring up sales from a new demographic of shoppers who have turned to e-commerce during COVID-19. \u201cBefore the pandemic, the e-commerce story seemed clear: It was geared towards younger, tech savvy generations and focused on specific, delivery-friendly categories, like electronics and clothing,\u201d said Pedro Palandrani, research analyst at ETF provider Global X EBIZ, +1.48%. \u201cHowever, post-pandemic, older generations realized that online shopping was not only a viable option for many of their needs, but also convenient and safe. With seniors increasingly utilizing the technology at much higher than expected rates, the trajectory for e-commerce\u2019s growth now looks quite different than it did just a few months ago. For Prime Day, this means a larger number of new customers.\u201d Other retailers have also jumped on Prime Day to drive their own sales. This year, for example, Target Corp. TGT, +1.14% is hosting Deal Days on Oct. 13 and Oct. 14 as well. Also: Target to host Deal Days shopping event during Amazon Prime Day Bank of America expects holiday comparative sales growth of 2.2%, compared with 2.7% growth last year. \u201cThis holiday, the continued shift online could pressure margins, but most retailers plan to start the holiday season earlier and push store pick-up to mitigate surcharges and ease traffic pressure during peak times,\u201d analysts wrote. \u201cAmazon\u2019s Prime Day is shifting to Oct 13-14 this year (vs. July prior) to kick off the holiday shopping season. Most stores will be closed on Thanksgiving, and Black Friday will not include the usual doorbusters due to safety and social distancing measures.\u201d Bank of America calls Target, Coach parent Tapestry Inc. TPR, +0.80% and Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. BBBY, -1.37% its top choices for the holidays. Analysts think Target\u2019s merchandise selection in \u201chigh-demand categories\u201d will give it an edge. Tapestry will see earnings upside due to \u201cstabilizing sales and margin improvement.\u201d And Bed Bath & Beyond is benefitting from a quicker-than-expected turnaround, led by Target vet Mark Tritton, currently the home retailer\u2019s chief executive, analysts say. Don\u2019t miss: Bed Bath & Beyond turnaround under way, but analysts say outside forces are also giving the company a boost Bank of America rates all three retailers buy. Amazon\u2019s price target was raised to $3,800 from $3,675 at Benchmark on Wednesday, which rates the company\u2019s stock buy. Amazon shares were up 2% in early Wednesday trading, and have soared 71% for the year to date. The Amplify Online Retail ETF IBUY, +1.39% has gained 80.6% for 2020 so far. And the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% is up 5.1% for the year to date."}]}
