Twitter hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been as consistently a target of the boycott call but has come under a new wave of scrutiny, and shares have fallen alongside those of Facebook. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe invest billions of dollars each year to keep our community safe and continuously work with outside experts to review and update our policies,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a Facebook spokesman said Monday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe know we have more work to do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The spokesman added that the company will continue to work with civil rights groups and other experts \u00e2\u0080\u009cto develop even more tools, technology and policies to continue this fight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vice president for global client solutions Sarah Personette said in a statement that the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mission \u00e2\u0080\u009cis to serve the public conversation and ensure Twitter is a place where people can make human connections, seek and receive authentic and credible information, and express themselves freely and safely.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She added that Twitter is \u00e2\u0080\u009crespectful of our partners\u00e2\u0080\u0099 decisions and will continue to work and communicate closely with them during this time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Read:Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Zuckerberg was reportedly talked out of making moves against Trump as far back as 2015 The boycotts stem from a #StopHateforProfits campaign announced by a coalition of civil-rights and other groups, including the Anti-Defamation League and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which has asked Facebook advertisers to show that they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t support companies that prioritize profits over safety. Since the launch of the campaign, the list of companies opting to pause advertising is growing, but Facebook is still looking at less than a 5% hit to revenue, said Rohit Kulkarni, executive director at MKM Partners, in a note to clients. Firstly, he said Facebook makes the bulk of its revenues from mobile direct ads and small-business marketing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFB has more than 160 million registered businesses globally and 8 million paying advertisers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Kulkarni, who noted that Ad Age\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 100 biggest advertisers spend less on a proportionate basis with Facebook. \u00e2\u0080\u009cProcter & Gamble PG, +0.89% \u00c2 is the largest advertiser in the world, but we think it accounts for less than 0.50% of FB\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revenues,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kulkarni said. Due to COVID-19, he said MKM had already expected leading advertisers to scale back on spending in the second half of this year, \u00e2\u0080\u009cimplying a lower marginal headwind\u00e2\u0080\u009d for Facebook. Wall Street is estimating 1% year-over-year growth in the second quarter and 7% in the third. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe believe near-term Street estimates are reasonable and that there is upside potential given ad market recovery.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said Snapchat parent Snap Inc. SNAP, -0.18% \u00c2 could benefit from \u00e2\u0080\u009cnear-term uncertainty with advertiser policies related to [Alphabet-owned GOOGL, +1.82% \u00c2 GOOG, +1.97% \u00c2 YouTube] and Instagram.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tim Rostan contributed to this report."}]}
