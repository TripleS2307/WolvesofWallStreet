After detailing a quarterly loss of $5 billion that was transformed into an adjusted profit thanks to an accounting trick involving sports rights, Disney changed the conversation by announcing that it would allow consumers to watch its long-delayed \u00e2\u0080\u009cMulan\u00e2\u0080\u009d film for $30 on Disney+ and launch a new international streaming service under its Star brand. Full earnings results: Disney shakes up streaming approach after losing nearly $5 billion due to pandemic Analysts were quick to jump on the positive news and use it to wipe away their previous doubts about Disney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile COVID-related dynamics are likely to severely impact many of Disney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s businesses for some time, we are removing the 20% risk discount we have applied to our target price given what we see as increased visibility,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Credit Suisse analysts wrote while upgrading Disney to outperform from neutral and raising their price target to $146 from $116. \u00e2\u0080\u009dWith new CEO Mr. Bob Chapek now indicating an \u00e2\u0080\u0098innovative and bold\u00e2\u0080\u0099 further pivot to streaming, we expect Disney shares to be even more aggressively positioned as a streaming growth story (where investors have limited investment vehicles), and eventual COVID recovery play.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Credit Suisse was one of at least three banks to upgrade Disney shares in the wake of the fiscal third-quarter earnings report, while many boosted their price targets, pushing the average price target on Disney stock from $128.48 to $132.09 Wednesday, according to FactSet tracking. Disney shares jumped as high as $130.31 before closing at $127.61, recording their best one-day percentage gain since March 24 and highest close since Feb. 25.

In explaining the difficult job of pricing the movie, Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger described it as \u00e2\u0080\u009cboth shockingly high, and quite a consumer bargain, depending on one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s view.\u00e2\u0080\u009d See also: Disney+ was the only plus for Disney as coronavirus slammed other businesses \u00e2\u0080\u009cCertainly, $30 for a family is significantly less expensive than it would cost to take that family to see this movie in a theater. On the other hand, the marginal cost of watching some other movie on Disney+ or Netflix is \u00e2\u0080\u0098zero.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Or framed differently, a consumer could receive almost a half-year of Hulu SVOD ad-supported, or Disney+ at the annual discounted rate, for the same price as watching Mulan once,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Juenger wrote while maintaining a market perform rating and raising his price target to $116 from $105. While the \u00e2\u0080\u009cMulan\u00e2\u0080\u009d move made big waves, analysts pointed out that Disney was adamant that the move was a one-off that will help get some needed revenue \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Juenger pointed out that less than 15% of Disney+ subs would need to rent the movie for Disney to get its costs back. The bigger long-term move from the analysts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 perspective was the move for an international Star-branded streaming service similar to Hulu, Disney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s majority-owned North American streaming offering. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe announcement lacked details, but we believe it is a significant development as it could be a driver in helping Disney achieve 200M global streaming subs, potentially in 2022, following reaching 100M in June,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rosenblatt Securities analyst Bernie McTernan wrote while maintaining his buy rating and increasing his target to $145 from $135. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis would be a significant milestone in catching up to Netflix NFLX, +1.43%, as we expect Netflix to cross 200M subscribers during CY\u00e2\u0080\u009920E.\u00e2\u0080\u009d See also:Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s everything coming to Netflix in August 2020 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leaving Juenger described it as \u00e2\u0080\u009ca chance to replay the [2019] playbook,\u00e2\u0080\u009d referencing Disney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s launch of Disney+ last year. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnnounce a new [direct-to-consumer offering].

Disney/Fox TV content is not consumer-distinguished in the same way as the Disney+ brands. There will be sizable required investments, we believe the biggest of which will be, once again, foregone licensing. Not to mention accelerated decline of int\u00e2\u0080\u0099l linear channels ($5bn write-off in the quarter).\u00e2\u0080\u009d Read: Walt Disney World tightens face mask policy after guests took advantage of loophole Not all analysts were swayed by Disney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s streaming plans. Needham analyst Laura Martin reiterated her hold rating and summarized the questionable numbers Disney released Tuesday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDisney provided no forward guidance. COVID-19-related costs in Disney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s FY3Q20 were $3B, net of cost savings, with Parks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 adverse impact alone at $3.5B. ... We remain on the sidelines until the structural economic impacts of COVID-19 on Disney are clearer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she wrote. Most other analysts, though, were happy to point toward new streaming initiatives as a potential savior for Disney. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDisney management delivered a focused message of boldly pursuing additional global streaming video opportunities by leveraging STAR and Disney+ assets and a premium VOD window,\u00e2\u0080\u009d wrote Guggenheim analysts, who upgraded the stock to buy from neutral and increased the price target to $140 from $123. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile it would be easy to maintain a cautious or skeptical approach to these initiatives, we expect the possible further expansion of streaming economics and core underlying investor confidence in Disney intellectual property make further share appreciation the more likely path from here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Disney Loses Nearly $5 Billion Amid Pandemic Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why Netflix stock, now below $500, is going to $1,000"}]}
