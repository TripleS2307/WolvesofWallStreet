The Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund XLI, +0.37% was up 2.3% in the late morning, as was the Vanguard Industrials ETF VIS, +0.34%, nearly double the gain in the broader market SPX, +0.87%. The iShares U.S. Industrials ETF IYJ, +0.65% gained more than 2%. The sector is down about 4.4% in the year to date, compared with a more-than 26% gain for the technology sector. Some of that year-to-date decline is because the category includes airlines, which have been hammered on stay-at-home orders. But on Wednesday, stocks like United Airlines Holdings, Inc. UAL, +0.32% and American Airlines Group, Inc. AAL, +0.34% were up nearly 4% in morning trade on hopes for fiscal stimulus."}]}
