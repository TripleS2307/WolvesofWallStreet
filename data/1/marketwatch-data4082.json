Airline stocks have been hammered during the height of the coronavirus pandemic and reports of treatments have buoyed the group. Shares of American Airlines Group Inc. AAL, +0.34% were up 10%, while United Airlines Holdings Inc. UAL, +0.32% shares jumped more than 9% and Delta Air Lines Inc. DAL, +0.39% shares rose 8.7%. JETS has drawn attention for its popularity among retail investors using the online platform Robinhood to place their bets. Over the past month, it's up about 9.5%, roughly in line with the best-performing stock index, the Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39%. But since the March 23 market bottom, it's gained only about 35%, compared to a 66% surge for the Nasdaq and a 53% jump for the broader S&P 500 SPX, +0.87%."}]}
