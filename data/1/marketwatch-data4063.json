The report showing statewide bed capacity of 83%, released Wednesday by the Department of Health Services, comes as the state deals with a surge in virus cases and hospitalizations that experts say is likely tied to Gov. Doug Ducey\u2019s ending of statewide closure orders in mid-May. Ducey has been criticized for not adding requirements that could prevent a surge, and some say the time to put those measures in place has come. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do some things right now we\u2019re going to end up either at a stay-at-home order or over-capacity or both,\u201d former state health director Will Humble said. \u201cBut the things that we can do now, they\u2019re going to take time to work.\u201d They include better infection control in nursing homes, masks in public and allowing cities to crack down on bar districts where social distancing has been ignored, Humble said. Ducey did none of those things when he lifted his orders last month. Halting elective surgeries would greatly affect patients, since surgical procedures affect their quality of life in measurable ways and are needed. And it would be a major financial blow for hospitals who get a major portion of their revenue from procedures. Many hospitals instituted furloughs, pay cuts or other savings measures during the first ban on elective surgeries. Health Services Department Director Dr. Cara Christ said her agency is looking at the bed use data supplied by hospitals and trying to determine if elective surgeries should stop. She declined to name the hospitals or hospital chains that concern her. \u201cHospitals will always get a chance to dispute our initial findings or provide data that may show us a different picture,\u201d Christ said. \u201cSo we are going to be working with some of the hospitals on that.\u201d None of the hospital chains contacted by The Associated Press said they were halting surgeries. Banner Health, the state\u2019s largest system with about half the state\u2019s beds, said it was below the threshold. But there are some hospitals that have acted, said Ann-Marie Alameddin, president and CEO of the Arizona Hospital and Healthcare Association. \u201cI have heard of hospitals that have cancelled procedures to make sure they are preserving that extra capacity,\u201d Alameddin said. \u201cIt\u2019s a financial issue, but hospitals are going to manage their patient care appropriately to make sure they can meet the needs of the community if there is a patient surge.\u201d Ducey halted elective surgeries on March 19 to preserve personal protective equipment like masks and gowns in the early part of the pandemic. The rules established under an executive order Ducey issued in April that allowed hospitals to resume elective surgeries are clear: Hospitals can only perform them if they have at least 20% of their beds available. Arizona hospitals were are 83% of capacity on Tuesday, up from 78% the previous day, according to state data. The state also exceeded 80% one day last week. The state has seen a major surge in virus patients that started about 10 days after Ducey\u2019s stay-home order and other restrictions ended on May 15. That\u2019s about the period of time it takes the virus to begin causing symptoms in patients. The state reported 1,556 new cases Wednesday and 25 new deaths. That brings the total cases to 29,852 and deaths to 1,095. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some \u2014 especially older adults and people with existing health problems \u2014 it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death. Dr. Marjorie Bessel, Banner\u2019s chief clinical officer, has been urging the public to take steps to slow the spread of the virus. They include wearing masks, limiting exposure in public spaces, frequent hand-washing and more. \u201cWe do have an ability to mitigate the spread of this virus right now \u2013 it\u2019s not necessarily the message that people always want to hear, but it is the message of what we know about the virus.\u201d Not taking those steps will impact people needing care at hospitals and the staff, who will be overworked. And if Banner is forced to end elective surgeries, that\u2019s a big deal, she said. \u201cElective surgeries \u2013 they\u2019re a little bit of a misnomer,\u201d Bessel said. \u201cThese are necessary surgeries \u2013 they\u2019re medically necessary surgeries.\u201d That means they are needed surgeries, just not so urgent that they need to be done immediately, \u201cAnybody\u2019s who\u2019s had a surgery knows that,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you need a surgery you need a surgery.\u201d Dr. Rebecca Sunenshine, Maricopa County\u2019s disease control director, said the county is now urging everyone to wear masks in public. That\u2019s a reversal for Sunenshine, who early in the pandemic said there was no evidence they could help prevent the virus\u2019 spread. \u201cNow there is a mounting body of scientific evidence that shows that cloth face mask, a well-fitted cloth face mask, can prevent COVID-19 from spreading,\u201d Sunenshine said Wednesday. She also noted a huge surge of cases in the county, the state\u2019s most populous. A full 27% of the 15,200 cases have come in the past week."}]}
