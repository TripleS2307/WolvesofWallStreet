The Fed controls short-term interest rates, so the policy won't directly impact mortgage rates. Instead, mortgage rates roughly track the direction of long-term bond yields, including the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.777%  . The yield on the 10-year note initially fell in response to the Fed's announcement. More notably for the mortgage market, Powell also said the Fed will continue buying mortgage-backed securities \"at least at the current pace.\" That will continue to pump liquidity into the mortgage market, which lenders will use to continue to offer low rates to attract borrowers. \"With no end in sight for this Fed policy, it's likely that mortgage rates are poised to remain low for a while,\" Speakman said."}]}
