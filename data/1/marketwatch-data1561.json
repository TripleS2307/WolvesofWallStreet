MRNA, +0.09% were up 1.9% in premarket trading on Thursday after the company said it has finalized the Phase 3 study protocol for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate. However, the Phase 2 trial, which began dosing patients less than two weeks ago, has not been completed. Moderna has previously said it expects the experimental vaccine to move into Phase 3 trials in July if it is successful in the mid-stage study. The plans for the Phase 3 trial include a randomized, placebo-controlled study with about 30,000 participants in the U.S. The primary endpoint will test whether a 100 microgram dose of the investigational vaccine prevents symptomatic COVID-19 disease, and secondary endpoints will evaluate if the vaccine candidate can prevent severe forms of COVID-19 and infection from the virus at all. Moderna's stock has gained 207.1% year-to-date. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% is down 1.2%."}]}
