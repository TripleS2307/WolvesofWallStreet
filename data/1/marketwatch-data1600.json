On Twitter, Trump said reopening guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are \u201cvery impractical\u201d and that he would be meeting with the organization. Those guidelines currently include spacing desks at least 6 feet apart and cleaning frequently touched surfaces, according to CDC Director Robert Redfield. Trump didn\u2019t say which of the guidelines he disagreed with. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Redfield told reporters that his agency will issue new guidance in the coming days and said keeping schools closed is not the intent. \u201cIt is critical that we get these schools open,\u201d he said at a briefing at the Education Department. Vice President Mike Pence told reporters at the same event that the administration will \u201cwork with\u201d schools if any of the recommendations present barriers to children returning to classrooms. In a separate tweet, Trump said school reopening is important for children and families. \u201cMay cut off funding if not open!\u201d he tweeted, without elaboration. Pence signaled that the White House would tie funding in the next coronavirus recovery package to reopening, saying the administration will look for a \u201cstrong incentive\u201d to get kids back to school. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Trump\u2019s tweets followed his call on Tuesday during a White House event for schools to reopen, even as the country neared its 3 millionth case of the coronavirus disease COVID-19, alongside nearly 131,000 deaths. \u201cWe want to reopen the schools,\u201d said Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s time to do it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very important for the well-being of the student and the parents,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to be putting a lot of pressure on: Open your schools in the fall,\u201d he said. Even as Trump made his preference clear, administration officials on Tuesday said the decision to reopen is up to local jurisdictions. Some public schools have announced plans to bring students back for only a few days a week, an option that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Tuesday said was unacceptable. During a call with governors Tuesday, DeVos criticized plans by Virginia\u2019s Fairfax County Public Schools to have families decide between fully remote instruction or two days a week at school. \u201cA choice of two days a week in the classroom is not a choice at all,\u201d DeVos said, according to audio of the call obtained by the Associated Press. U.S. stocks DJIA, +0.56% rose in Wednesday\u2019s trade, led by the tech-heavy Nasdaq COMP, +1.39%, even as investors dealt with an acceleration of coronavirus infections in the U.S. and escalating tensions between Washington and Beijing.
