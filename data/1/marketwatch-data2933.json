BA, -0.39% rose 1.3% in premarket trading Wednesday, after the aerospace and defense giant reported a much wider-than-expected loss, amid a big miss in commercial airplanes revenue, but reported free cash flow that was much less negative forecast. The net loss narrowed to $2.38 billion, or $4.20 a share, from $2.94 billion, or $5.21 a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding non-recurring items, the core loss per share narrowed to $4.79 from $5.82 but was much wider than the FactSet consensus for a loss of $2.57, as results were \"significantly impacted\" by the COVID-19 pandemic and 737 MAX grounding. Revenue fell 25% to $11.81 billion, below the FactSet consensus of $12.95 billion. Among Boeing's business segments, Commercial Airplanes revenue tumbled 65% to $1.63 billion, below the FactSet consensus of $2.91 billion; Defense, Space & Security revenue was little changed at $6.59 billion, just shy of expectations of $6.62 billion; and Global Services revenue dropped 23% to $3.49 billion, below expectations of $3.68 billion. Free cash flow was a negative $5.63 billion, to beat the FactSet consensus of negative $6.67 billion. Boeing said it will lower the production rate for 787 planes to 6 per month in 2021, from previous guidance of a gradual reduction to 7 per month in 2022 from 10 at the end of 2020. The production rate for 777/777X planes was cut to 2 per month from 3 per month. The 737 production rate is expected to gradually increase to 31 per month by the beginning of 2022. The stock has tumbled 47.6% year to date through Tuesday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% has lost 7.6%."}]}
