Do you have a question about buying or selling a home? Do you know where your next move should be? Email Jacob Passy at jpassy@marketwatch.com. Dear MarketWatch, I\u2019m a tech worker in Silicon Valley, and my company recently informed us that we can work remotely indefinitely. There\u2019s a lot I love about living here \u2014 including the easy access to Michelin-starred restaurants and to outdoor activities like hiking and surfing. What I don\u2019t love is the high cost of living. I earn all this money, and it goes on rent and transport and, yes, eating out. With everything that\u2019s happened in the last six months, I have had long talks with friends about our future, and our relationship to our work. There\u2019s got to be some reward for all of the long days, right? I\u2019m a renter right now, but I have enough money saved up to buy a home somewhere. I hate to leave, but several members of my friend group have the same idea. We\u2019re done! My money would go much further outside of Northern California. Where should I go? Searching and So Over It in San Jose Dear Searching, Open Google Maps GOOG, +1.97% GOOGL, +1.82% and take your pick. You\u2019re far from alone when it comes to working from home on a more permanent basis. As far back as May, major companies like Twitter TWTR, -0.23% and Square SQ, +2.06% \u2014 which are both run by Jack Dorsey \u2014 said they would allow many employees to work from home indefinitely. A survey of more than 300 chief financial officers conducted by research firm Gartner found that around nearly three-quarter of them plan to shift at least 5% of on-site employees to permanently-remote positions post COVID-19. It appears that there\u2019s something of a a movement afoot. The pandemic has forced lots of people to rethink their living arrangements. Faced with the prospect of working from home for many, many more months to come, major cities like New York and San Francisco are seeing an exodus of folks moving to the suburbs. And still more people are looking for cheaper housing in light of the pandemic-fueled economic downturn. Even before COVID-19, high-cost housing markets like where you live in San Jose were seeing people leave simply because it got to be too expensive. So where were those people moving? An analysis of listing-view data from Realtor.com found that 62.8% of the homes San Francisco Bay Area shoppers looked at were in fact not in the Bay Area. Here are Top 10 counties with the most home-listing views from current Bay Area residents: . Sacramento . San Joaquin . Placer . El Dorado . Stanislaus .. Monterey . Los Angeles . Santa Cruz . Fresno .. Nevada Buying a home like this in the Bay Area of California could cost you an arm and a leg \u2014 but looking further afield will provide you with many more affordable options. Getty Images \u201cWe are seeing a migration out of San Francisco to what we\u2019ll call the North Bay, the East Bay, the Central Valley, and even Sacramento,\u201d said Scott Fuller, a real-estate broker and founder of LeavingTheBayArea.com, a real-estate services firm that helps people relocate out of California. \u201cPeople are feeling like they\u2019re being given some independence and some flexibility and they want what they would consider a better quality of life,\u201d he said. Many of the counties from Realtor.com\u2019s list \u2014 including Sacramento and San Joaquin\u2014 are in the Central Valley. This region has become increasingly popular in recent years because of high home prices in areas like San Jose and San Francisco. (Realtor.com is operated by News Corp NWSA, -1.35% subsidiary Move Inc., and MarketWatch is a unit of Dow Jone, which is also a News Corp subsidiary.) But moving to this part of California has its trade-offs. \u201cThe most exciting thing you could do is go to Safeway or maybe duck hunting,\u201d said Pat Kapowich, a Silicon Valley-based real-estate broker. \u201cIt\u2019s still really a bedroom community \u2014 you have to get in your car if you want to do anything exciting or fun.\u201d \u201c \u2018It\u2019s still really a bedroom community \u2014 you have to get in your car if you want to do anything exciting or fun.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Pat Kapowich, a Silicon Valley-based real-estate broker, on the downsides to living in California\u2019s Central Valley It\u2019s a bit of a resurgence of the drive-until-you-qualify phenomenon we saw in the housing bubble that preceded the Great Recession \u2014 people are moving to many towns and cities in this region despite the hours-long commute to work because they can afford to buy a home here. For someone in your position, who can work remotely indefinitely, living in the Central Valley could make a lot of sense. It\u2019s not too long of a drive to many of the amenities you like about where you live now \u2014 the beach, the mountains, and even Napa Valley\u2019s wineries. Plus, you need to consider the fact that you might want to change jobs eventually \u2014 and, if you do, your new job might not be remote. If you choose to buy in this region, you could theoretically commute to a job in Silicon Valley, if need be. But let\u2019s say that you\u2019re tired of California living. There are many markets across the country where you could be happy. Again, one consideration should be whether the region has a thriving or growing tech sector. Along those lines, there are the usual suspects \u2014 places like Seattle, Denver and Austin. But other markets Fuller and Kapowich identified as being popular among his clients also include areas like Phoenix, Nashville, Raleigh, N.C., and Boise, Idaho. Even more places to consider include Scottsdale, Ariz., Reno and Santa Fe or Albuquerque, N.M. In most of these places \u201cfor $500,000 and less you can get into a home that\u2019s going to be at least 3,000 square feet,\u201d Fuller said. Don\u2019t miss:California\u2019s emigrants aren\u2019t all moving to cheaper housing markets Fuller estimated that some 80% of his clients who choose to relocate fully outside of California still stay west of the Rocky Mountains. \u201cThey\u2019ve got family or something that\u2019s tying them back so they want to be within a couple of hours plane ride to get back to California,\u201d he said. Some of these cities \u2014 like Seattle, Nashville and Denver \u2014 will offer lots in the way of restaurants, entertainment and access to the great outdoors. Unfortunately, it may be hard to fully replicate the lifestyle you currently can lead in the Bay Area. \u201cHere you have all these activities within a 90-minute drive,\u201d Kapowich said. \u201cYou can go surfing on Saturday and snow skiing on Sunday.\u201d Why didn\u2019t I give you one or two suggestions? These aren\u2019t normal times, so instead I suggest you reach out to your network to see if you know people who live in those areas and get the honest truth from them about what lifestyle you could lead after you move. The pandemic is a time when we can and should lean on each other. Take some time to narrow down where you might want to live, and then fly out to see if your most desired amenities are within a stone\u2019s throw. If you have got close friends who have the same idea, you can pool your resources, creatively, if not financially. It might be easier if you made some of these decisions together."}]}
