The first time, he showed up an hour before the public testing site was set to close and was told they had reached capacity. He was turned away from a second center when rain shut it down, and voluntarily left a third after someone ahead of him said they had been waiting in line for more than three hours. \u201cIf you have symptoms and you are just driving around the city trying to figure out how you can get a test, for people who are positive, it is not ideal,\u201d said Lee, who finally got a test on June 29 after he showed up at a site before dawn and waited for more than two hours. Another five days passed before he was able to view the results online, and he didn\u2019t receive a text with the results until seven days after being tested. Four months, 3 million confirmed infections and over 130,000 deaths into the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S., Americans confronted with a resurgence of the scourge are facing long lines at testing sites in the summer heat or are getting turned away. Others are going a week or more without receiving a diagnosis. Some sites are running out of kits, while labs are reporting shortages of materials and workers to process the swabs. Some frustrated Americans are left to wonder why the U.S. can\u2019t seem to get its act together, especially after it was given fair warning as the virus wreaked havoc in China and then Italy, Spain and New York. \u201cIt\u2019s a hot mess,\u201d said 47-year-old Jennifer Hudson of Tucson, Arizona. \u201cThe fact that we\u2019re relying on companies and we don\u2019t have a national response to this, it\u2019s ridiculous. \u2026 It\u2019s keeping people who need tests from getting tests.\u201d It took Hudson five days to make an appointment through a CVS pharmacy near her home. She booked a drive-up test over the weekend, more than a week after her symptoms \u2014 fatigue, shortness of breath, headache and sore throat \u2014 first emerged. The clinic informed her that her results would probably be delayed. Testing has been ramped up nationwide, reaching about 640,000 tests per day on average, up from around 518,000 two weeks ago, according to an Associated Press analysis. Newly confirmed infections per day in the U.S. are running at over 50,000, breaking records at practically every turn. More testing tends to lead to more cases found. But in an alarming indicator, the percentage of tests coming back positive for the virus is on the rise across nearly the entire country, hitting almost 27% in Arizona, 19% in Florida and 17% in South Carolina. While the U.S. has conducted more tests than any other nation, it ranks in the middle of the pack in testing per capita, behind Russia, Spain and Australia, according to Johns Hopkins University. \u201cI am stunned that as a nation, six months into this pandemic, we still can\u2019t figure out how to deliver testing to the American people when they need it,\u201d said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of Harvard\u2019s Global Health Institute. \u201cIt is an abject failure of leadership and shows that the federal government has not prioritized testing in a way that will allow us to get through this pandemic.\u201d Testing alone without adequate contact tracing and quarantine measures won\u2019t control the spread of the scourge, according to health experts. But they say delays in testing can lead to more infections by leaving people in the dark as to whether they need to isolate themselves. In other developments: \u2022 While the number of confirmed cases in the U.S. hit 3 million Wednesday by Johns Hopkins\u2019 count, health officials have said that because of inadequate testing and the many mild infections that have gone unreported, the real number is about 10 times higher, or almost 10% of the U.S. population. \u2022 A crowd of thousands attending President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in late June, along with large groups of people who showed up to protest, \u201clikely contributed\u201d to a dramatic surge in new coronavirus cases in the area, Tulsa City-County Health Department Director Dr. Bruce Dart said Wednesday. Tulsa County reported 261 confirmed cases on Monday, a new record one-day high, and another 206 confirmed cases on Tuesday. A spokesman for the Trump campaign didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. \u2022 Most New York City students will return to school in the fall two or three days a week and learn online the rest of the time under a plan announced by Mayor Bill de Blasio. He said schools can\u2019t accommodate all their students at any one time and maintain social distancing. The school system in New York is the biggest in the nation, with 1.1 million students. It has been closed since March. In New York City, the most lethal hot spot in the nation during the spring, testing was scarce early on but is now widely available. As many as 35,000 tests are conducted daily through a combination of private health organizations and city agencies, according to the city Health Department. \u201cWidespread testing holds the key to reopening our city safely,\u201d de Blasio said. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services this week said it will open free \u201csurge testing\u201d sites in three hard-hit cities: Jacksonville, Florida; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and Edinburg, Texas. The sites will be able to conduct as many as 5,000 tests a day in each city, with results in three to five days, officials said. In Georgia, one of the states where cases are surging, officials are rushing to expand testing capacity as demand threatens to overwhelm six major sites around Atlanta, said DeKalb County CEO Michael Thurmond. \u201cIf you project this out over the next three weeks, we can\u2019t handle it,\u201d he said. In New Orleans, people were turned away from a free testing site for a third consecutive day after it reached its daily allotment of tests. Health care providers are running low on trays and chemicals needed to run machines used in the tests. Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego called the situation there \u201cdesperate\u201d as residents have sat in sun-baked cars for up to 13 hours to get drive-thru testing. Robert Fenton, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said FEMA is doubling the testing supplies it plans to ship to Arizona. Patrick Friday, a United Methodist minister in Alabama, went to several hospitals and clinics in Birmingham this week to get checked after his school-age son tested positive. But he was told that unless he had a preexisting condition, he didn\u2019t qualify. Finally, he ended up at a site offering rapid-result tests and his negative result came back quickly. \u201cWe are several months into this,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can it be that we can\u2019t go in and get a test?\u201d"}]}
