Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican and fervent backer of the president, doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite see it that way, however, and, in an an interview this week with Snapchat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s SNAP, -0.18% Peter Hamby, he summed up QAnon in these two words: \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098Batshit crazy\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d For those fortunate enough not to have been exposed to QAnon, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the basic belief system: The \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeep state\u00e2\u0080\u009d is being run by a bunch of left-wing elites, who also happen to be murderous pedophiles working to tear down the Trump presidency. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also cannibalism. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCrazy stuff. Inspiring people to violence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Graham said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think it is a platform that plays off people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fears, that compels them to do things they normally wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do. And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very much a threat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yet QAnon remains popular in some of the more extreme corners of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s base. Just take a look at what happened in Georgia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 14th District earlier this month: Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has previously endorsed the theory, actually won a Republican primary and looks like a safe bet to win a seat in the House of Representatives in November.
