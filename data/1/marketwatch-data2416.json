Don't count on it, warns \u00e2\u0080\u0098Dr. Doom\u00e2\u0080\u0099", "body": "\u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098The European system of greater social cohesion gives you better economic outcomes than the one of the United States that is just Wild West capitalism. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why the unemployment rate barely went up in Germany or even in Italy, while in the U.S. we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had double-digit unemployment rate and actually even worse, considering underemployment and so on.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s NYU economics professor Nouriel \u00e2\u0080\u009cDr. Doom\u00e2\u0080\u009d Roubini explaining to Bloomberg Television in a recent interview why he believes the battered U.S. economy will have a particularly tough time delivering the swift rebound some have been predicting amid the coronavirus pandemic. In fact, Roubini, who was once named one of the \u00e2\u0080\u009ctop 100 global thinkers\u00e2\u0080\u009d after he nailed the housing crisis more than a decade ago, said that the V-shaped bounce \u00e2\u0080\u009cis becoming a U, and the U could become a W if we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find a vaccine and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have enough stimulus.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Last week, initial weekly jobless benefit claims rose above 1 million again, worse than expected and potentially pointing to an increase in layoffs after a summer coronavirus surge. Bottom line, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMain Street is struggling,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Roubini said, and those struggles obviously aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t being reflected in the stock market, where the major indexes are bouncing around record highs. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a clip from the interview: iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } At last check, stocks were building on recent gains, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% \u00c2 up almost 300 points to start the week. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% \u00c2 and Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39% \u00c2 were both firmly in the green, as well."}]}
