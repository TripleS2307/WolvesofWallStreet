In two weeks, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be making that move \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to a home they bought that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never seen in person. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCOVID just sped everything up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Vanni, 29, told MarketWatch. The pandemic made moving closer to family a priority for the couple. Originally, the pair were thinking of first relocating to Minneapolis to a rental and then looking for a home to buy in person this fall. But their Realtor encouraged them to start looking sooner. Like many other parts of the country, more homes are listed for sale in the summertime than during other parts of the year. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe decided that we wanted to look remotely just in case we found something we really loved,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Vanni said. Eventually Vanni found the home they ended up buying when a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccoming soon\u00e2\u0080\u009d listing for it appeared online. Vanni had her parents tour the property with their real-estate agent \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Vanni and her fianc\u00c3\u00a9 Hank saw the property over video chat. The couple quickly put in an offer that got accepted. The couple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experience buying a home essentially sight unseen is not an uncommon one, particularly during the coronavirus pandemic. A Redfin study RDFN, +2.16% \u00c2 released in late July found that 45% of people who bought a home in the past year had made an offer on a home they hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t toured in person. That was up from 28% of people surveyed around this same time a year ago and 20% of people when Redfin first conducted a survey on this topic. \u201c 45% of people who bought a home in the past year had made an offer on a home they hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t toured in person, according to Redfin \u201d That percentage is likely to climb in the months to come. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI predict that by the end of the 2020 home-buying season, the majority of homebuyers will have made a sight-unseen offer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Redfin chief economist Daryl Fairweather said in the report. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe pandemic has changed the way many people view homes, and on top of that, the market is highly competitive. If you aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t using this strategy, another buyer who is could beat you to the punch.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gabrielle Pinkerton, an event planner who recently moved from California to a suburb south of Nashville, also made an offer on a home her family hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen in person, though she did tour the home during the inspection. While virtually touring the home saved Pinkerton money, it was a nerve-wracking experience. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was definitely a gamble and, for such a large purchase, I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t normally buy blindly like this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur health was more important so we chose not to travel during that time because of the virus.\u00e2\u0080\u009d With more families across the country likely to buy homes while relying solely on virtual methods to explore the properties, MarketWatch spoke with real-estate experts and home buyers to get advice on how to approach the process.Picking the right real-estate agent is even more important Pinkerton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main tip for buyers was to select a Realtor that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trustworthy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur Realtor knew us from when we lived in California,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe knew our personalities and he was the best person to represent us in-person when we couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go.\u00e2\u0080\u009d After all, your real-estate agent will be your eyes and ears during the touring process. When evaluating potential agents, it can be useful to find one who is experienced in helping people who are relocating, argued Scott Fuller, a real-estate broker and founder of LeavingTheBayArea.com, a real-estate services firm that helps people relocate out of California. Most agents, he said, are more used to working with people who are moving within a community. Brokers that specialize in relocation may understand more of the challenges that come along with buying a home sight unseen. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot more unknowns and hand-holding involved,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Fuller said. The best agent will also be one that can act as a \u00e2\u0080\u009chuman Rolodex,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Fuller said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCan your agent help you to schedule movers and get different moving options and quotes?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCan your agent help to set up utilities and services is at your home or at least provide contact information for water, gas, garbage and electrical, everything else that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to need to set up?\u00e2\u0080\u009dBe mindful of \u00e2\u0080\u0098analysis paralysis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Many people are accustomed to browsing sites like Zillow ZG, -0.42% \u00c2 or Realtor.com these days to see what homes are available where they want to buy. And one of the big benefits of buying a home virtually is that it can actually be a less time-consuming process. After all, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easier to set up multiple tours when you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to hop in the car and drive to see all of them. \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098We just had to count on the inspection turning up anything that might be a pitfall.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Nora Vanni, a home buyer who purchased a property virtually But over-browsing can actually make the process more stressful. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe emotional experience of buying a home and looking at it online becomes addictive,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Fuller said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou tend to spend a lot of time and start focusing on things you necessarily shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it becomes analysis paralysis.\u00e2\u0080\u009d One way to avoid the information overload is to create a detailed list of your must-haves in your new home. Using these to limit your search will help prevent you from getting caught in the weeds.Request the most in-depth video tour possible Ahead of the tour, buyers should request a floor plan of the home, said Kelly Gaitten, an agent with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices BRK.A, +0.06% \u00c2 in Virginia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThink about things as far as the feel of a room,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat looks good in a picture of the family room might be way too small. So measurements and floor plans are huge right now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ideally, the tour should actually begin well before the agent reaches the front door. Ideally, the real-estate agent should begin the tour while driving up to the home in question, Fuller said. This will give you a better sense of the neighborhood and local amenities. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a parent, you may also want to request that the agent drive from the home to the nearby schools to give a sense of how long it would take the kids to get to school each morning. \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098If it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty tight, and the seller knows that one of the buyers hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actually seen it in person, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to lean towards the guy that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually seen it in person.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Maggie Wells, an agent with Keller Williams in Lexington, Ky From there, the real-estate agent should show you every part of the home from every possible angle. As the tour is going on, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hesitate to ask as many questions as possible \u00e2\u0080\u0094 particularly about the things you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t learn just from looking at a home. Does a room smell moldy or like cigarette smoke? Can you hear planes overhead or the neighbor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dog barking all day? Real-estate agents will gladly answer questions about these aspects of the home. But keep in mind there are other times when an agent can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give their opinion. The National Association of Realtors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 code of ethics prohibits agents from providing subjective opinions on things like nearby schools. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not allowed to steer people on what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good and what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bad,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Maggie Wells, an agent with Keller Williams in Lexington, Ky. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t waive the home inspection Laws vary from state to state on whether home sellers are required to provide potential buyers with disclosure forms detailing a house\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history and condition. And a video tour can only key a prospective buyer into so much. Today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s real-estate market may be a competitive one, which can make waiving the home inspection tempting because it can be attractive to buyers. But doing so is a very risky proposition. Real-estate experts and buyers told MarketWatch that the home inspection takes on renewed significance if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re buying a home sight unseen. Vanni and her fianc\u00c3\u00a9 opted for a more expensive \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but more thorough \u00e2\u0080\u0094 inspection when they purchased their new home. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe just had to count on the inspection turning up anything that might be a pitfall,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Vanni said. When reviewing the report, pay particular attention to expensive parts of the home that could be in rough shape, such as the roof or HVAC system.Sellers may be biased against buyers who haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t toured in person Once it comes time to make an offer, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s critical that a buyer who hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t toured the home in person put their best foot forward in today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s competitive market. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty tight, and the seller knows that one of the buyers hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actually seen it in person, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to lean towards the guy that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually seen it in person, because the person who had seen it virtually could get cold feet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wells said. Wells suggested that when buyers line up financing they choose a local mortgage lender rather than an online lender or a major bank. In her area, many seller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agents are wary of larger lenders because of the difficulties people can have getting in touch with a loan officer or customer service. And one common tactic Realtors encourage buyers to take is sending a personalized letter to the seller explaining who you are and what you love about the home. That can be useful in this situation, but Fuller actually recommended taking it a step further. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat you really need to do is you need to put that to video, so the seller can kind of get that emotional connection,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said."}]}
