Stocks put in a choppy performance Thursday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell announced that the Fed was shifting to a policy of average inflation targeting which would effectively see policy makers end the practice of preemptively hiking interest rates to stave off inflation. Need to Know:The Fed might never hike rates again. Here are growth stocks for the long run, according to one strategist \u201cBy any metric, valuations are in nosebleed territory, but there is this entrenched view that the Fed has your back, that the polls are wrong and there will be a Trump sweep, and that a vaccine is coming this fall,\u201d said David Rosenberg, a long-time strategist now running his own firm, Rosenberg Research. \u201cThese are hardened views in the marketplace. That\u2019s what\u2019s triggering this ongoing rally in risk equities.\u201d Reflationary moves in the market, including the steepening of the yield curve and jump in bond yields to a roughly two-month high, is \u201clikely temporary, but may still have more room to run near-term,\u201d Rosenberg said in an interview with MarketWatch. The Fed\u2019s new stance might as well be \u201can overt attempt to steepen the yield curve to help out the bank stocks,\u201d Rosenberg noted. \u201cThey have helped out everyone else \u2013 the growth stocks, the credit markets, everything except the value trade, which needs the steeper yield curve. They\u2019ve made no bones about the fact that they want to stimulate financial conditions. I\u2019m not bullish on the economy going into the fourth quarter, and I don\u2019t think the Fed is going to be successful in generating sustainable inflation any more than they have over the past 12 years. But I do think it\u2019s a great buying opportunity for Treasurys.\u201d See:\u2018The stock market no longer thinks it needs the economy if it has the Fed,\u2019 David Rosenberg says Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester, in a television interview Friday, said the economic recovery from the pandemic-induced recession \u201cis likely to be a slow one.\u201d \u201cThere is more pain out there that we are going to have to support the economy through,\u201d Mester said. Data showed U.S. personal income rose 0.4% in July, while consumer spending was up 1.9%. Economists surveyed by MarketWatch expect had expected income to fall another 0.4% after a 1.1% drop in June. Spending was expected to show a 1.6% rise after a 5.6% increase in June. Spending on durable goods is up 12.2%, while spending on services is down 9.3% for a net shortfall of 4.6% in total consumer demand, said Aneta Markowska, chief financial economist at Jefferies, adding that the variation in spending patterns explains \u201cpart of the disconnect between the stock market and the economy, since the former has much less exposure to the service sector than the latter.\u201d Read:Stop saying \u2018stocks are not the economy\u2019 The final reading of the University of Michigan\u2019s August consumer sentiment index came in at 74.1 versus a preliminary reading of 72.8 and up from 72.5 in July.Which stocks were in focus?
