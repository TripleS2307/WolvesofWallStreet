Dr. Stephen Hahn, FDA Commissioner, told the Financial Times that his agency may make a vaccine available before Phase 3 trials have been completed, but only if it is convinced that the benefits outweigh the risks. Hahn suggested it could do so using its emergency use authorization (EUA), which is not a full approval, but could be put into effect for certain groups, such as health care workers. \"We have a convergence of the Covid-19 pandemic with the political season, and we're just going to have to get through that and stick to our core principles,\" Hahn told the newspaper. \"This is going to be a science, medicine, data decision. This is not going to be a political decision.\" His comments come after a difficult week for the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with both public agencies facing criticism that they have become increasingly politicized during the Trump administration. Hahn had to admit he misspoke at a press conference accompanied by Trump to announce an EUA for convalescent plasma in treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients, when he described its expected benefits. Trump had criticized the FDA for working slowly on treatments for COVID-19 to stop him being re-elected. Then CDC head Robert Redfield had to walk back a change in guidelines on testing to exclude asymptomatic patients, even if they had been exposed to the virus, after an outcry from doctors and scientists. Ana Santos Rutschman, assistant law professor at Saint Louis University, Lisa Vertinsky, law professor at Emory University in Atlanta, and Yaniv Heled, associate professor of law at Georgia State University in Atlanta, said last week they are worried by the incidents and fear they are not isolated. \"We believe that this episode is symptomatic of a larger problem, and we worry that FDA's repeated departure from evidence-based standards and long-tested and proved procedures will soon translate into a poorly considered authorization of COVID-19 vaccines,\" they wrote in commentary. There was more controversy on Monday, when the Washington Post reported that Scott Atlas, a neuroradiologist from Stanford's Hoover Institution who joined the White House earlier this month as a pandemic adviser, is pushing for the U.S. to adopt the Swedish approach to the crisis of seeking herd immunity. Herd immunity is the notion that once a high proportion of a population has contracted or been vaccinated against an infectious disease, the likelihood of others in the population being infected is drastically reduced. That same approach has left Sweden, which did not lock down or even introduce many restrictions for its citizens, preferring to ask them to voluntarily comply with safety measures, with a far higher case tally and death toll than its neighbors and has been widely criticized by infectious disease experts. Sweden has 57.16 deaths from COVID-19 per 100,000 people, just ahead of the U.S. with 55.95 per 100,000 people, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. By comparison, neighbor Finland has just 6.07 deaths per 100,000 people, the data show. A Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine report recently concluded that Sweden is nowhere close to achieving herd immunity more than four months into the pandemic. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Meanwhile, President Trump over the weekend added to the misinformation that is spreading across the internet on COVID-19, when he retweeted a conspiracy theory that claims the U.S. death toll of more than 183,000 is exaggerated because many of the people who died had underlying health issues and were elderly, as the New York Times reported. The conservative website that originally sent the tweet has criticized key members of the White House Task Force created to manage the pandemic, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the task force. Fauci said over the weekend that the pace of enrollment in trials and level of infections in the U.S. mean it is \"conceivable\" that we get an answer to the question of when a vaccine will be available by year-end. In other news: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 German Chancellor Angela Merkel sharply criticized an attempt by protesters angry at coronavirus restrictions to storm the German parliament, saying the \"shameful\" effort was abuse of the right to demonstrate peacefully. Several hundred people tried to gain entrance to the Berlin Reichstag building during a rally in Berlin on Saturday. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Hundreds of people demonstrated on Sunday in Boston to protest a new state rule mandating flu shots for students.

Gov. John Bel Edwards said the coronavirus has killed 400 times as many residents of the state as the major storm. In the absence of data, officials are looking to other metrics to gauge the spread, including hospitalizations, which were rising on Friday and Saturday, he said. Louisiana is expected to see an uptick in case numbers, as many residents fled the storm in crowded buses and were photographed not wearing face masks. Louisiana has 148,030 cases and 4,931 deaths, according to a New York Times tracker. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 New Jersey restaurants will be allowed to open at 25% of capacity from Friday, Gov. Philip Murphy said in a tweet. That means they will be able to resume limited service during the coming Labor Day holiday weekend, he said. \"Reopening responsibly will help us restore one of our state's key industries while continuing to make progress against Covid-19,\" iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } Latest tallies There are now 25.3 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, according to the Johns Hopkins data, and at least 847,400 people have died.
