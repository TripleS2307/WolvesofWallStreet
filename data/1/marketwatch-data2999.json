If Mirror reached that revenue figure, it would account for about 10% of Lululemon\u2019s LULU, +2.52% annual total. Calvin McDonald, Lululemon\u2019s chief executive, said the deal will be financed with the company\u2019s $1.5 billion in liquidity, with the transaction expected to close in a week or two. Mirror is an interactive workout platform that looks like a mirror when it isn\u2019t in use, but becomes a screen showing fitness classes and more when activated. The core Mirror product starts at $1,495 and a subscription is $39 per month. Mirror launched in 2018 and had a previous partnership with Lululemon. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, at-home fitness was a growing business, with Bank of America forecasting disruption at the high end of the health club category as Mirror and other options make classes cheaper.

Bank of America rates Lululemon stock buy with a $340 price objective. \u201cRecognizing the work-out-from-home surge, the idea behind the acquisition makes perfect sense,\u201d wrote BMO Capital Markets analysts led by Simeon Siegel. \u201cWhat the two companies ultimately do for each other remains to be seen. We love the brand, but are wary that sales and margins are approaching a crossroads.\u201d BMO notes that Lululemon\u2019s North American sales for the last 12 months totaled about $3.3 billion, approaching a revenue threshold that analysts say requires expensive marketing and other pricey investments to surpass. Also:Gap hopes it can burnish its image with a new Kanye West clothing line, repeating the rapper\u2019s brand success with Adidas BMO also highlights the likely consumer overlap between Mirror and Peloton Interactive Inc. PTON, +6.97% , \u201csuggesting Lululemon\u2019s ability to reach and grab the incremental at-home fitness customer away from Peloton could be meaningful.\u201d BMO rates Lululemon stock market perform with a $192 price target. Raymond James analysts see the acquisition as a long-term growth opportunity that bolsters the case for Lululemon\u2019s stock price. Lululemon shares closed Tuesday up 6% to $312.01. The stock has rallied nearly 33% for the year to date while the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.87% has slipped 3.3% for the period. See: Nike\u2019s COVID-related sales decline is a bump on the path to long-term growth, analysts say \u201cWe therefore see Lululemon\u2019s acquisition of Mirror as extremely timely and one that positions it to benefit from a large shift in consumer behavior,\u201d wrote Raymodn James analysts led by Matthew McClintock. \u201cImportantly, we believe the acquisition could prove to be a boon to Lululemon\u2019s valuation over time.\u201d Raymond James rates Lululemon shares strong buy with a $335 price target."}]}
