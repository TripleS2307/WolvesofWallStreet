Wages - some 70% of employment costs - increased 0.4% in the second quarter. Benefits jumped 0.8%, according to the government's closely followed employment cost index. In the 12 months ended in June employment costs increased at a modest 2.7% rate, based on unadjusted data. The ECI reflects how much companies, governments and nonprofit institutions pay their employees in wages and benefits. Yet the report is not likely to offer much useful benefit until the pandemic recedes. The viral outbreak has caused the loss of millions of jobs, distorted the labor market and made it almost impossible to glean clear trends from the ECI data."}]}
