The director of national intelligence, John Ratcliffe, said most briefings on what the administration knows about efforts to influence the vote will now be given to Congress in writing. In the past, delivering \u201call-member\u201d briefings in-person, he said, has resulted in \u201cleaks\u201d for political purposes within moments. President Donald Trump has made that same claim as the news that congressional briefings would be halted was met by outrage from lawmakers and the public. \u201cA falsehood, yet again another lie by the president,\u201d responded Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Sen. Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with the chamber\u2019s Democrats, said on MSNBC early Monday that he can recall no leak of classified information in his years on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. He added that Ratcliffe will need to demonstrate an understanding of the difference between intelligence classified for legitimate reasons of national security and information that might merely be embarrassing. Ratcliffe said those lawmakers who are \u201centitled to the briefings and classified information will still get that information\u201d and that the briefings would be \u201cprimarily in writing.\u201d \u201cWhat we won\u2019t be doing is all-member briefings, to all members of the House and all members of the Senate,\u201d he said. King said it\u2019s a rare in-person briefing at which the give-and-take between intelligence professionals and lawmakers does not yield valuable information. Background (May 2020):Democrats remain skeptical that Ratcliffe will operate independently as the Trump ally and Texas Republican wins confirmation as intelligence chief John Ratcliffe, then a Republican congressman from Texas a day away from formal renomination by President Trump for director of national intelligence, speaks on Feb. 27, 2020, at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference at Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center in National Harbor, Md.

There was little time for Democrats to challenge the decision in the shadow of the Nov. 3 election and few options to compel the administration to change course, though they mustered plenty of outrage.

The decision on briefings, Biden said in a statement, shows that Trump is \u201choping Vladimir Putin will once more boost his candidacy and cover his horrific failures to lead our country through the multiple crises we are facing.\u201d Schiff, D-Calif., said his committee could demand that Ratcliffe or other intelligence officials testify under oath, but that decision would be made by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. An official with Schiff\u2019s committee said Ratcliffe\u2019s decision was unexpected because Ratcliffe\u2019s office earlier had reached out to schedule an in-person briefing to the committee on Sept. 17. A room on Capitol Hill had already been reserved, according to the official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. \u201cWe will compel the intelligence community to give Congress the information that we need,\u201d Schiff said. Ratcliffe insisted that China is the graver threat to election security than Russia. Earlier this month, the nation\u2019s counterintelligence chief, William Evanina, issued a statement saying U.S. intelligence officials believe Russia is using various methods to denigrate Biden and that people linked to Russian President Putin are boosting Trump\u2019s reelection bid. U.S. officials also believe China does not want Trump to win a second term and has accelerated its criticism of the White House, Evanina wrote. \u201cThis is not where you cut off Congress from getting the information. That\u2019s what happened in 2016 \u2014 there wasn\u2019t enough information out there. Now we know. We\u2019ve learned a lesson,\u201d said Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. A requirement to subpoena Ratcliffe, she said, \u201cis crazy. We are just a few months out of a major election.\u201d In a statement late Saturday, the acting chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee indicated the Senate may still have some access to some briefings. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said that the \u201cgrotestque criminal misconduct\u201d of leaking does not release intelligence agencies from fulfilling their legal requirements to keep Congress informed. It was unclear whether that means Senate will receive in person briefings. A spokesman for Rubio said he would not elaborate beyond the statement. Trump on Saturday said Ratcliffe \u201cgot tired\u201d of intelligence about election security leaking from Congress. The president did not offer details to support his statement. From the MarketWatch archives (August 2019): Trump says Rep. John Ratcliffe has withdrawn as intelligence chief nominee amid concerns about his experience and charges that he inflated his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 Maine Sen. Angus King, a member of the Senate committee, said the idea that the national intelligence director\u2019s office would stop briefing Congress on foreign threats to the U.S. election is \u201can outrage\u201d and that written updates were \u201cflatly insufficient.\u201d \u201cAmerica\u2019s election \u2014 indeed, our foundation of democracy itself \u2014 is under threat as we face weaponized disinformation from global foes around the planet,\u201d King said in a statement. \u201cTo stifle and limit the American peoples\u2019 awareness of this fact cannot be explained \u2014 or allowed.\u201d Ratcliffe was on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning Futures,\u201d Schiff was on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d and Klobuchar appeared on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d Read on:Flynn-Kislyak transcripts released by Ratcliffe, and allies and foes of Trump administration say they prove their points MarketWatch contributed."}]}
