More people are out on the sidewalks. Gyms are open again. Though Broadway\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still dark and Manhattan CEOs are grumbling about \u00e2\u0080\u009cwidespread anxiety,\u00e2\u0080\u009d many offices aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite as empty as they were before Labor Day. Meanwhile, indoor dining and classroom learning are both set to return by the end of the month\u00e2\u0080\u0094with restrictions. But there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still a big missing piece in the complex puzzle of New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slow resurgence, and transit officials are struggling mightily to fit it back in. The subway is still a relative ghost town. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome back,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Patrick Foye, chairman and CEO of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, was saying a couple of hours after Gov. Andrew Cuomo instituted new $50 fines on Thursday for anyone caught on a train or in a station without a face mask. Is the subway safe? \u00e2\u0080\u009cAbsolutely,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Foye said. With fewer riders, cleaner trains, overnight shutdowns and mask-wearing already north of 90%, the MTA chairman does seem to have science on his side. But he still needs to gain the confidence of millions of his former riders as well as reluctant Republicans in Washington who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been maddeningly slow to step up with a financial bailout. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a five-alarm fire, a 100-year fiscal tsunami,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Foye, a veteran of the Empire State Development Corporation and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe get half our revenues from customers based on ridership, and we get a package of subsidies from the state legislature,\u00e2\u0080\u009d shares of the mortgage-recording tax, payroll-mobility tax and other revenue streams that have also been whacked by the coronavirus pandemic. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe state of New York and the city of New York are in equally perilous waters,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Foye said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only the federal government that has the resources and the capability.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The stakes could hardly be higher for the New York economy, as the city creaks back to life. Those 36 lines, 472 stations and 691 miles of track aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just a means of transportation. They are the irrigation system that nourishes all those gleaming Manhattan skyscrapers and has kept the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy humming for the past 116 years. No one would get anywhere with a couple of million extra cars on the streets. Subway ridership has been inching back up since the depth of the spring, when fare card swipes and taps were down 95% from last year. Now, the passenger count is off 73%, which comes out to about 1.6 million riders a day. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good sign but still far short of the 5 million-plus who rode on a typical weekday last year. Coronavirus update: U.S. case and death tallies keep rising, as Fauci warns not to look on the \u00e2\u0080\u0098rosy side\u00e2\u0080\u0099 MTA figures tell a fascinating story about the metropolitan area\u00e2\u0080\u0099s uneven recovery. City bus ridership is almost half back now. And traffic on the MTA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bridges and tunnels\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Triborough Bridge, Queens-Midtown Tunnel, Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel and five other crossings\u00e2\u0080\u0094is down just 10%, suggesting that many people are still more comfortable in their own cars. On Wednesday, 833,000 cars and trucks paid MTA tolls. Meanwhile, the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s two commuter lines\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Long Island Rail Road and the Metro-North Railroad\u00e2\u0080\u0094are down even more sharply than the subway. What gives there? Part of it may be that suburban commuters are more likely to own cars. But a bigger explanation, Foye said, is that many white-collar professionals in the suburbs are still working from home or from satellite offices outside the city. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not so possible if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a construction worker or a waiter or you work in a pharmacy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a remote working option.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But the pattern in New York\u00e2\u0080\u0094cars first, city transit next, suburban rail after that\u00e2\u0080\u0094is a repeat of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already happened in large European cities, the MTA chairman said. So a big part of the focus now is building confidence at home. Foye noted a recent study from the American Public Transportation Association concluding that transit ridership has not been a vector for spreading the virus. And MTA officials are working with researchers at Columbia University who believe that ultraviolet light can help disinfect a transit system. The subway\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overnight closing has helped transit workers and teams from the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Department of Homeless Services find shelter for homeless people\u00e2\u0080\u0094or at least escort them out of the system. And Cuomo, Foye and other New York officials keep glancing toward Washington, while trying to ease local concerns. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNew Yorkers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 behavior does not rest in the hands of Washington,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Foye emphasized. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA lot of this is up to us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Clearly, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still a ways to go. Also see: I went to the Met, and here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I saw At an emergency MTA board meeting in August, budget officials warned that if Washington doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t step up, the only alternative will be 40% cuts in bus and subway service and 50% cuts on Metro-North and the Long Island Rail Road, plus 8,500 layoffs. Said Foye: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Great Depression wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t nearly as bad as this.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ellis Henican is an author based in New York and a former newspaper columnist."}]}
