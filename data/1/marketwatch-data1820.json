The term conjures up visions of open prairies and animals on the hoof. But all of a sudden, one research scientist is asking: Could certain densely packed New York City neighborhoods have already achieved herd immunity against the deadly coronavirus? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s far from proven, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not quite as far-fetched as it sounds. And there might even be some rough justice lurking in here somewhere. The biggest beneficiaries of herd immunity, if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually happening, would be poorer and especially immigrant neighborhoods, the very communities hit hardest by the virus so far. \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u009c...I want to note that we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have proof of it, and we should just work off of an abundance of caution, not rest on that laurel, if you will.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio When herd immunity takes hold, so many infected people have already developed antibodies that the disease just peters out. The petering-out part would be fabulous. The getting-there part? Not so much. Up till now, herd immunity has not won much respect in the global fight against the novel coronavirus. Sweden moved in that direction this spring and quickly got the highest infection rate in Scandinavia. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was a proponent until he contracted COVID-19 and nearly died. And Wednesday on Staten Island, Mayor Bill de Blasio threw cold water on the whole idea of herd immunity in New York. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSomething has gotten around out there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the mayor said, \u00e2\u0080\u009csort of folk wisdom in some communities. But I want to note that we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have proof of it, and we should just work off of an abundance of caution, not rest on that laurel, if you will.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Added de Blasio: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re nowhere near that point from what we know and understand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But in fact it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data from the mayor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own Health Department that has reinvigorated the herd immunity discussion in New York, along with a provocative interview on a brainy British website that, yes, went viral. First the interview. Sunetra Gupta, a theoretical epidemiologist at Oxford University, spoke with Reaction.life, a London-based journal of news and commentary edited by former Scotsman and Wall Street Journal executive Iain Martin. In the interview, Gupta argued that coronavirus antibody rates are so high in some neighborhoods of London and New York that parts of those cities may have already achieved herd immunity. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA large swath of the population has been exposed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSome have become immune, and therefore exhibit antibodies\u00e2\u0080\u00a6And some were resistant to start with.\u00e2\u0080\u009d However they got their protection, this could be a life saver should another wave of the virus hit this fall. Said Gupta: \u00e2\u0080\u009cUnder those circumstances, no, we shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see a huge surge in infections in those regions like London and New York where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had a major incidence of infection and death.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Call it much-deserved payback for March and April, when things got really bad around here. But not evenly bad, according to a fresh data dump from the New York City health department. Coronavirus tally: U.S. daily death toll tops 1,000 for 3rd-straight day The department has just released 1.5 million coronavirus antibody test results, a far larger sample than had been made public before. The clear trend: Lower-income neighborhoods, especially those with large immigrant populations, have far more antibodies than richer ones. That makes sense because so many of those people worked right through the plague. Unlike a lot of wealthy New Yorkers, they weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hiding in the Hamptons or the Hudson Valley for the last six months. Citywide, the positive rate was 27%. Of the five boroughs, the Bronx was highest, 33%. Manhattan was lowest at 19%. But that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fully reveal the disparities. In Corona, Queens \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a neighborhood packed with Spanish-speaking immigrants, many of whom have been working all year \u00e2\u0080\u0094 51% of those tested had antibodies for coronavirus. South of 96th Street in Manhattan, not a single ZIP Code topped 20%.\u00c2 Depending how contagious an infection is, usually 70% to 90% of a population needs immunity to achieve herd immunity, according to Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. At one clinic in Corona, 68% of the antibody tests came back positive. In upscale Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, it was 13%. So what does all this mean? Well, for one thing, if there is any herd immunity, those with the most infection would likely get the most protection. Finally, some good news for Corona at the expense of Tribeca and the Upper East Side. And second, whatever immunity might be out there, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still almost certainly a good idea to keep doing all the things that helped New York beat back the raging virus this spring.

The murky future of NYC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nightlife business That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the plea being made by the mayor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s public health adviser, Dr. Jay Varma. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still in the wear-a-mask-and-wash-your-hands school of medicine. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom our perspective,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe only way to continue to keep infections low, like we have right now, is to focus on all the things we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 face coverings, social distancing, limits on gatherings, good hygiene \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and it may very well be that there is some percentage of the population that is currently immune that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also helping keep our infection rates low. But I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think that we should be complacent and rest upon that until we know more.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ellis Henican is an author based in New York City and a former newspaper columnist."}]}
