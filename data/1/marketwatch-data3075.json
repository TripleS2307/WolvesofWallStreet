On Friday, December gold GCZ20, +2.17% GC00, +2.17% declined by $16.40, or 0.8%, to settle at $1,947.90 an ounce, following a rise of 0.5% Thursday. December silver SIZ20, +5.96% SI00, +5.96%, meanwhile, gave up 43 cents, or 1.6%, at $26.857 an ounce. For the week, gold tallied a 0.7% gain, while silver climbed by 0.5%, based on the most-active contract settlements last Friday, FactSet data show.

U.S. benchmark stock indexes were lower for the week. Bullion, which has ascended in price amid the global viral outbreak, has benefited recently from newfound volatility in the stock market after the precious metal\u2019s coronavirus-fueled advance stalled out over the past few weeks. Gold investors, meanwhile, make the case that uncertainty around the U.S. presidential elections on Nov. 3, with incumbent President Donald Trump trailing former Vice President Joe Biden in national polls, and concerns about the virus and geopolitical tensions, provide a host of possible catalysts for gold to rise. Looking at the technical picture, Otunuga said a breakout or breakdown \u201copportunity is in play\u201d with support level of $1,910 and resistance level of $1,985 \u201cacting as key levels of interest. Weakness below $1,910 may trigger a drop towards $1,890 and $1,865, respectively.\u201d In other metals trading Friday, December copper HGZ20, +1.38% tacked on 1.4% to $3.0395 a pound, ending around 0.7% for the week. October platinum PLV20, +3.99% shed nearly 0.2% to $939.60 an ounce, with prices up about 4.6% for the week. December palladium PAZ20, +2.31% fell by a dime to $2,330.80 an ounce, losing 0.5% for the week."}]}
