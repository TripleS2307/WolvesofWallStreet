That they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve lived through this before. That the pride comes before the fall. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Yet here I am. Beating them like a drum for the past three months at their own game.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy appearing to fully embrace his unofficial role as leader of an army of day traders that has taken Wall Street by storm amid a public health crisis that has rocked Wall Street and the economy. In an op-ed on Fox Business on Friday, Portnoy claims a financial community that initially embraced him as a newbie bringing a younger crowd\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention to the world of investing became resentful of the success that he seemed to be enjoying using his unique brand of equity trading. See: AOC goes after Barstool founder Dave Portnoy on Twitter over labor unions \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe finance community welcomed me with open arms. But then something funny happened along the way. I started winning and they started losing. The more I won, the more mad they got,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he writes in the op-ed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYet I ask them, how many global pandemics have they actually lived through? The answer is zero.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The outspoken Barstool founder\u00e2\u0080\u0093cum\u00e2\u0080\u0093go-go trader has drawn outsize attention as an avatar of the young investors that have made massive, and so far successful, bets on a powerful recovery for stocks from their March lows. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% and the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% have soared 35% since hitting a low point on March 23 amid a coronavirus-induced rout. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.39%, meanwhile, has vaulted 43% higher and earlier this month notched its first closing record since Feb. 19.

FB, +0.26%, Amazon.com AMZN, +3.01%, Apple AAPL, +1.74%, Microsoft MSFT, +2.48% and Google and YouTube parent Alphabet GOOG, +1.97% GOOGL, +1.82%, which have been among the biggest gainers during the market\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recovery from the economic fallout of the pandemic. On top of that, those speculative investors have also bought stocks that were brutalized in the initial selloff, including airlines and travel-related companies, including American Airlines Group Inc. AAL, +0.34%, Delta Air Lines Inc. DAL, +0.39%, Carnival Corp. CCL, +0.51% \u00c2 and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL, +2.59%. Some have made the case that an era of zero-commission discount brokerage trades, ushered in by Charles Schwab SCHW, +1.29%, and platforms like Robinhood that cater to younger investors, combined with a dearth of diversions due to COVID-19 lockdowns and unemployment over the past few months, have created a perfect environment for newly minted day traders like Portnoy. Portnoy has been cast as the \u00e2\u0080\u009csupreme leader\u00e2\u0080\u009d of this band of investors by the Financial Times, which has described his acolytes as \u00e2\u0080\u009cretail bros.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The antics of Portnoy have been notable and outlandish, including live streaming his trading exploits, picking investments based on selecting letters at random from a bag of Scrabble tiles and declaring himself better suited to the current investing environment than legendary long-range investor Warren Buffett. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not saying I had a better career. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the best ever to do it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m the new breed. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m the new generation. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nobody who can argue that Warren Buffett is better at the stock market than I am right now. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m better than he is. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fact,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. On Friday, he claimed that he has \u00e2\u0080\u009cas much experience in this trading climate as they do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd maybe the very fact that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not burdened with their history has allowed me to see this market for what it is, while they have failed miserably,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. Day traders, however, may have been smarting on Friday, as rising cases of the coronavirus knocked returns lower for bullish investors.
