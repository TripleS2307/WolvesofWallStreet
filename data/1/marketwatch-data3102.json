Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg News U.K. travel and leisure stocks slumped on Monday, as Germany warned over Spain\u2019s rising coronavirus cases, fueling worries about an uptick in coronavirus cases in Europe. Like the U.K., Germany is imposing a two-week quarantine on those who return from Spain. TUI TUI, -0.92%, the U.K.-listed German travel operator, slumped over 5%. Iberia owner International Airlines Group IAG, -3.72% dropped 3.8%, InterContinental Hotels IHG, +1.35% fell 2.1% and easyJet EZJ, -4.22% fell 2.4%. London-listed Ryanair RYA, -2.60% RYAAY, -2.08% shares fell 4.3%, as the Irish airline operator said it was cutting capacity by 20% in September and October. Forward bookings have \u201cnotably weakened over the last 10 days, given continuing uncertainty over recent COVID case rates in some EU countries.\u201d The capacity reductions will be focused on Spain, France and Sweden, where case rates have led to increased travel restrictions, and Ireland, which the airline said has a \u201cuniquely restrictive\u201d quarantine, said the airline, which is a holding of hedge-fund giant Elliott Management, according to the latest 13-F filings.
