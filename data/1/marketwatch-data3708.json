The Chinese Embassy in Washington said that a statement issued by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo deliberately distorts the facts and disregards the efforts of China and the others to achieve peace and stability in the South China Sea. \u201cThe United States is not a country directly involved in the disputes. However, it has kept interfering in the issue,\u201d the embassy said on its website. \u201cUnder the pretext of preserving stability, it is flexing muscles, stirring up tension and inciting confrontation in the region.\u201d Pompeo, in a statement released Monday, said the U.S. now regards virtually all Chinese maritime claims outside its internationally recognized waters to be illegitimate. The new position does not involve disputes over land features that are above sea level, which are considered to be \u201cterritorial\u201d in nature. Previous U.S. policy had been to insist that maritime disputes between China and its smaller neighbors be resolved peacefully through U.N.-backed arbitration. Pompeo\u2019s statement was a major change in South China Sea policy, said Zhu Feng, the director of a South China Sea studies center at Nanjing University. He said other countries challenging China\u2019s claims may take a more aggressive stance because of America\u2019s openly stated support. \u201cThe U.S. didn\u2019t used to comment on the sovereignty issue in the South China Sea, because it itself is not the claimant,\u201d Zhu said. \u201cBut this time it has made itself into a judge or arbiter. It will bring new instability and tension.\u201d He advised against a strong response from China, saying that current U.S. policy toward the country is being driven in a significant way by President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection considerations. \u201cTrump\u2019s current China policy is insane,\u201d Zhu said. \u201cHe is making the China issue the most important topic for his election to cover his failure in preventing the epidemic and to divert public attention. I have no idea how far he will go in fully utilizing the China issue.\u201d Chu Yin, a professor at the University of International Relations, dismissed the statement as a campaign move that doesn\u2019t deserve serious attention. \u201cI personally believe that Trump doesn\u2019t have the ability to introduce a medium to long-term strategy.\u201d Chu said. \u201cIf the two governments want to engage in strategic dialogue, we will have to wait until the completion of the U.S. election.\u201d Associated Press researcher Yu Bing contributed to this report."}]}
