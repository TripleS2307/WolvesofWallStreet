What does the future of aging in America look like? For answers, every year we ask some of our newest Influencers in Aging to offer their views at the American Society on Aging\u2019s Aging in America conference. The pandemic turned this year\u2019s in-person panel into a June 11 webinar, and the Influencers\u2019 forecasts \u2014 as well as their laments \u2014 couldn\u2019t have been timelier. \u201cI want to acknowledge that we as a country have had a few rough months and weeks. We are living and dying in at least two pandemics: COVID-19 and racism,\u201d said panelist Imani Woody, named an Influencer in Aging for her work to create Mary\u2019s House, an independent living community for LGBTQ older adults in Washington, D.C.The influencers in aging webinar panelists The two pandemics shaped Woody\u2019s webinar comments as well as those of the two other panelists: Ron Long, head of Wells Fargo\u2019s Aging Client Services Center of Excellence and an authority on elder financial abuse, and Larry Curley, executive director of the National Indian Council on Aging, a nonprofit advocating for the health, social services and economic well-being of American Indian and Alaska Native Elders. \u201cI really believe that what\u2019s been happening in this country, especially in the era of COVID-19, is that we\u2019ve gotten to a point where I feel as if elders have been a dispensable product; that it\u2019s OK that they\u2019re collateral damage. And that concerns me,\u201d said Curley. \u201cWhen we start devaluing elder people, we have a very serious problem in our country, and we need to address it.\u201d Also read: The coronavirus recession is destroying millennials\u2019 retirement dreams and they need to act now And, Long noted, \u201cWe are all in this boat together and all of us have to make sure we\u2019re not leaving anyone behind.\u201d \u201cHere, here!\u201d Woody responded. I hosted the one-hour webinar and asked each panelist to talk about: what concerns them about aging in America, what they\u2019re most optimistic about and where they think the future of aging in America is heading. You can read highlights below and watch the free webinar on the American Society of Aging\u2019s webcast site. One more thing before getting to what the panelists said: Next Avenue just opened nominations for our 2020 Influencers in Aging. Please send us yours soon at our site\u2019s Influencers in Aging nomination submission page. Highlights from the webinar:What concerns us about aging in America Ron Long: \u201cThere is a lack of coordination among [government] agencies, financial firms, regulators, nonprofits and other third parties as we try to take on this important mission of elder financial abuse prevention and protection\u2026We could have a centralized portal where no matter where you are, if you see a victim of elder abuse, you send it in and within seconds that portal should be able to send a full report to the adult protection agency that can help that elder get through that situation and to law enforcement if that\u2019s critical. Also see: COVID-19 will force older workers into early retirement \u201cI\u2019m also concerned about isolation and social disconnection in coordination with many cases of elder abuse\u2026When folks are isolated, it makes it easier for scammers to work on them\u2026.I fully anticipate that as we start going back and visiting our parents more [as the pandemic lessens], we will learn about more elder abuse cases that have occurred during COVID lockdowns.\u201d Larry Curley: \u201cCOVID-19 has had a major, major impact on Indian Country, with what it has done and services that have been disrupted for elderly people, who are having a difficult time dealing with it. The coronavirus infection rate on reservations has equaled those of New York and New Jersey. In Arizona, Indians comprise 6% of the population, yet they represent 16% of the fatalities from COVID-19. \u201cFunding has always been low for the Indian Health Service, the primary health provider for Indian people\u2026The funding level has been a challenging endeavor in light of COVID-19. Moreover, there are only eight nursing homes on Indian reservations with a total bed capacity of just over eight hundred\u2026.And one in three Indian Country elders are diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia.\u201d Imani Woody: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to be old and gay at the same time. Many old LGBTQ SGL [Same Gender Loving] people are finding it insurmountable and are going back into the closet. These times of COVID-19 make it definitely worrisome\u2026LGBTQ people of color and elders can be particularly marginalized. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be in the position where a 30-year-old and I need to use a ventilator. The decision makers may think I\u2019ve already led a full life. Yes, the ageism and disregard for old people generally is fierce.\u201dWhat we\u2019re most optimistic about and want to see Ron Long: \u201cWe are aging well and living longer. Some say that with better science and medical innovations, we will live longer and healthier so that you can be playing tennis at 95 \u2014 singles, not doubles\u2026.It will be absolutely critical to be able to financially support those longer lives.\u201d Read: For older workers, there are risks if they return to the office\u2014and if they don\u2019t Larry Curley: \u201cThere is room for optimism and hope in Indian Country. One of the things I see is an increase in the growth of intergenerational programs that preserve the language, customs and traditions of Native Americans\u2026The younger population is looking to the elders \u2014 our living encyclopedias who hold the history of Indians in their minds and hearts.\u201d Imani Woody: \u201cWe can create aging communities and social service environments that are visibly welcome and inclusive. We can continue to develop programs that specifically address the needs of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and same-gender loving people, particularly LGBTQ people of color.\u201d \u201cWe can produce materials that celebrate the lives of older, LGBTQ SGL elders. We can dismantle institutional levels of racism, ageism, heterosexism and classism.\u201dWhere the future of aging in America is heading Ron Long: \u201cI would like us to do [in the U.S.] what they\u2019ve done in England: have a Minister of Loneliness\u2026.That can start us on the path to look at the right solutions.\u201d Larry Curley: \u201cIncreasing numbers of tribal governments see the value of elders and have begun to move forward and fund elderly programs far more than ones the federal government is providing.\u201d \u201cWith the prevalence of the incidence of Alzheimer\u2019s in Indian Country, where are the caregivers \u2014 the people trained to deal with people with Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia?\u201d What I\u2019d like to see nationwide is a much greater emphasis on training more caregivers. That\u2019s something this country needs to respond to, I think.\u201d Imani Woody: \u201cI would like to see a change in our culture in how we treat our elders and how we house our elders. \u201cI\u2019m in my 60s and I\u2019ve been marching awhile\u2026women\u2019s rights, reproductive rights, LGBTQ SGL rights, civil rights for black people, for people of color\u2026.[Being older] doesn\u2019t stop you from being politically reactive. Political is the personal.
