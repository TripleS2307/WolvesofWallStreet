A day after tumbling 1.4% in a late-day slide, the Stoxx Europe 600 index SXXP, +0.55%  was flat at 366.37, vacillating between gains and losses, and headed for a loss of just over 0.5%. The French CAC 40 PX1, +0.71%  rose 0.4% and the FTSE 100 PX1, +0.71%  gained 0.4%, but the German DAX DAX, +0.06%  eased 0.1%.

That filtered through to gains for the rest of the sector, with shares of Sabadell SAB, -3.18%  rising 11% and Bankinter BKT, -3.43%  up 5%. Banco Santander SAN, -1.48%  SAN, -1.28%  rose 3% and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria BBVA, -1.40%  BBVA, -1.84%  rose over 4% each. \"While Spanish banking consolidation has seen a number of false starts, we believe consolidation is fast becoming much more of an imperative given [1] COVID fallout; [2] low rates; and [3] relaxation of merger requirements by the ECB/SSM (European Central Bank/Single Supervisory Mechanism),\" said Citi analysts Stefan Nedialkov and Anand Demble, in a note to clients. Citi has a buy rating on Bankia and neutral on CaixaBank. Investors remained focused on U.S. markets after the Dow industrials DJIA, +0.56% tumbled by more than 800 points on Thursday, driven by a tech-led selloff that wiped 5% off the Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39%.

The unemployment rate fell to 8.4% from 10.2%, the government said on Friday. In Europe, data showed German manufacturing orders losing steam in July, though they rose for the third-straight month. One notable element of Thursday's trade was that this year's standout advancers were among the worst performers.
