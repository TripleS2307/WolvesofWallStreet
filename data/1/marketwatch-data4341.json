A day after tumbling 1.4% in a late-day slide, the Stoxx Europe 600 index SXXP, +0.55% \u00c2 was flat at 366.37, vacillating between gains and losses, and headed for a loss of just over 0.5%. The French CAC 40 PX1, +0.71% \u00c2 rose 0.4% and the FTSE 100 PX1, +0.71% \u00c2 gained 0.4%, but the German DAX DAX, +0.06% \u00c2 eased 0.1%. An outperformer among regional indexes, Spain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s IBEX 30 IBEX, -0.59% \u00c2 climbed 0.7%, as shares of CaixaBank CABK, -2.15% \u00c2 surged 11% and Bankia BKIA, -2.99% \u00c2 jumped 23% after the Spanish banks said late on Thursday that they are in talks over a possible merger, potentially the biggest tie-up in the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s banking sector in years. That filtered through to gains for the rest of the sector, with shares of Sabadell SAB, -3.18% \u00c2 rising 11% and Bankinter BKT, -3.43% \u00c2 up 5%. Banco Santander SAN, -1.48% \u00c2 SAN, -1.28% \u00c2 rose 3% and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria BBVA, -1.40% \u00c2 BBVA, -1.84% \u00c2 rose over 4% each. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile Spanish banking consolidation has seen a number of false starts, we believe consolidation is fast becoming much more of an imperative given [1] COVID fallout; [2] low rates; and [3] relaxation of merger requirements by the ECB/SSM (European Central Bank/Single Supervisory Mechanism),\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Citi analysts Stefan Nedialkov and Anand Demble, in a note to clients. Citi has a buy rating on Bankia and neutral on CaixaBank. Investors remained focused on U.S. markets after the Dow industrials DJIA, +0.56% tumbled by more than 800 points on Thursday, driven by a tech-led selloff that wiped 5% off the Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39%. Along with the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87%, all three indexes marked the worst one-day drop since June 11. Stocks remained in the red for Friday. August U.S. payrolls gains data came in with a better-than-expected gain of 1.4 million, versus the 1.2 million gain expected. The unemployment rate fell to 8.4% from 10.2%, the government said on Friday. In Europe, data showed German manufacturing orders losing steam in July, though they rose for the third-straight month. One notable element of Thursday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trade was that this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s standout advancers were among the worst performers. Some of that selling continued on Friday, with communications company Sinch SINCH, +3.90% \u00c2 dropping 3% after falling nearly 10% on Thursday. Elsewhere, shares of Ryanair Holdings RYA, -2.60% \u00c2 rose 2.5%. The cut-rate airline said it raised \u00e2\u0082\u00ac400 million ($474.1 million) via a slightly discounted share placing late on Thursday. The airline is seeking to preserve cash and boost its financial position in an industry heavily damaged by the global pandemic. Shares of rival easyJet EZJ, -4.22% \u00c2 climbed 2.3%. Virgin Atlantic announced on Friday that it had completed a a \u00c2\u00a31.2 billion ($1.6 billion) rescue plan, but would still need to cut 1,150 jobs.

Shares of Just Eat Takeaway.com TKWY, +1.00% \u00c2 slipped 0.8%. Rival GrubHub GRUB, +0.83% \u00c2 said on Friday the acquisition by the Netherlands-based food delivery service is proceeding as expected, but disclosed an amendment to the merger agreement in which the \u00e2\u0080\u009cend date\u00e2\u0080\u009d is extended to Dec. 31, 2021 from June 10, 2021."}]}
