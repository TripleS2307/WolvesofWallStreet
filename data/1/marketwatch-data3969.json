Cuomo orders travelers from states with high number of COVID-19 cases to provide location info", "body": "New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday he is issuing an Emergency Health Order that will require that all travelers from states that are seeing spikes in COVID-19 cases provide a location form before leaving the airport, or face a summons and $2000 fine. The order will be enforced in every airport in the state, and travelers will have to say where they have come from and where they are going. The forms will be distributed on planes before landing. \"If you leave the airport without providing the information, in addition to a fine you can can be brought to a hearing and ordered to complete mandatory quarantine,\" Cuomo told reporters at a briefing. The move comes after New York ordered travelers from states with high numbers of cases to self-quarantine for 14 days, an order he conceded has not been fully complied with. Travelers from Georgia have infected New Yorkers in at least one county. \"We can't be in a situation where we have people coming form other states in the country bringing the virus again, it is that simple,\" he said."}]}
