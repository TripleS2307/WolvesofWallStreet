The food delivery company--which was formed through the merger of Just Eat and Takeaway.com--said that it has started an \"aggressive investment program\" and will invest in the U.K., Canada, Australia, Italy, Spain, France and several other ex-Just Eat markets. For the half year ended June 30 the company made a loss before tax of 121 million euros ($142.1 million), compared with a loss of EUR7 million for the comparable period last year. Revenue for the period rose to EUR1.03 billion, from EUR715 million.
