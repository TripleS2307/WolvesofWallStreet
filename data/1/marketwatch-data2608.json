He also is expected to talk up his achievements since his inauguration and pledge other accomplishments if he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s re-elected, as well as highlight a $750 million deal with Abbott Laboratories ABT, +1.02% \u00c2 for the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new rapid-response COVID-19 antigen tests. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s speech is slated to serve as the grand finale for the four-day, mostly virtual Republican Nation Convention, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s due to be delivered from the White House grounds. His address on Thursday night will follow testimonials earlier in the week from a range of speakers, including Donald Trump Jr. and Nikki Haley on Monday, first lady Melania Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday, and Vice President Mike Pence on Wednesday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTonight the president will deliver a tough speech, because Americans have tough choices in front of them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Trump re-election campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s communications director, Tim Murtaugh, told reporters during a conference call Thursday. Murtaugh said Trump will draw a contrast between his \u00e2\u0080\u009cexemplary\u00e2\u0080\u009d record and Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009c47-year record of failure as an elected official in Washington, D.C.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Republican incumbent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spokesman said Trump will accuse Biden of running \u00e2\u0080\u009cas an empty shell of a candidate \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a Trojan horse of a candidate \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that is being filled with the agenda of the radical leftists who are now in charge of the Democrat Party.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pence on Wednesday also described Biden as a Trojan horse. In addition, the president will \u00e2\u0080\u009cdescribe Joe Biden as a weak candidate with a poor record,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as well as \u00e2\u0080\u009clay out his vision and things he wants to accomplish in a second term,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Murtaugh said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe president will place a strong emphasis on jobs and economic recovery and economic excellence vs. Joe Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s record as one who has raised taxes, will raise taxes and has been a champion of outsourcing our jobs to other countries,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Trump spokesman added. He will cast the former vice president as having a \u00e2\u0080\u009cradical left-wing agenda on a variety of topics,\u00e2\u0080\u009d such as \u00e2\u0080\u009cour nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s borders, taxes, energy policy, trade, China, of course, and areas involving crime.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe president will also compare his record of mounting an unprecedented effort to combat the coronavirus vs. Joe Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basement strategy of sitting on the sidelines and offering nothing but useless criticisms,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Murtaugh said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe president will talk about the hurricane, and the preparations that have been made and ask for God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blessing for the people who are in its path. And he will also talk about the unrest that we have seen in American cities, including Kenosha, Minneapolis, Portland, Seattle, Chicago and other cities.\u00e2\u0080\u009d See:Hurricane Laura downgraded to category 3 as it moves across Louisiana And read:How the 2020 hurricane season could end up rivaling the worst on record Meanwhile, the Biden campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deputy campaign manager and communications director, Kate Bedingfield, said in a statement early Thursday that Trump has \u00e2\u0080\u009ccalled himself a wartime president, but instead of rallying the country in the fight against the single greatest challenge facing our nation, he and Mike Pence are waving the white flag of defeat, betting everything on the pandemic simply \u00e2\u0080\u0098disappearing\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 all while trying to tear our nation apart.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe American people cannot afford to wait any longer for this administration to finally take this threat seriously,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added. The Biden campaign also has said the GOP convention\u00e2\u0080\u0099s speakers have been revealing an \u00e2\u0080\u009cinability to make any affirmative case for Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s re-election after he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s made the United States the hardest-hit country by the pandemic in the entire world, and made divisive poison his calling card.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s speech last week at the Democratic convention, the former vice president cast himself as \u00e2\u0080\u009can ally of the light, not the darkness,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as he pledged to rebuild the battered U.S. economy and tackle the coronavirus pandemic. The longest economic expansion in American history ended earlier this year as nationwide lockdowns to contain the coronavirus pandemic hammered businesses and workers. The biggest unknown about the U.S. economy right now could be just how much the recent loss of federal aid will stunt a recovery that already has lost steam. Among the other speakers due to make remarks at the GOP event on Thursday night are Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Rudy Giuliani, Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Housing Secretary Ben Carson and Ivanka Trump, who is slated to introduce her dad before his speech. Trump already has spoken at the Republican National Convention, having been featured in videos and having made an in-person appearance on Monday during roll-call voting in Charlotte, N.C. In his remarks Monday, the president criticized Biden for not traveling to last week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Democratic convention due to ongoing public-health concerns, and Trump continued his long-running attacks against mail-in ballots. The accomplishments that he might talk up on Thursday include the 2017 tax cuts, a new trade deal with Canada and Mexico, and a 2018 criminal-justice reform law.
