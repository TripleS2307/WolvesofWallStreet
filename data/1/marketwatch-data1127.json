On Monday, Trump tweeted that he would leave Walter Reed Medical Center in the evening. He urged people \u00e2\u0080\u009cdon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be afraid of COVID\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cdon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let it dominate your life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as some \u00e2\u0080\u009creally great drugs\u00e2\u0080\u009d have been developed under his administration. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI feel better than I did 20 years ago!,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said. Meanwhile, the latest U.S. death toll from COVID-19 was 209,938, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University, which is roughly 2,600 more than the total reported by MarketWatch on Thursday afternoon. Trump had tweeted that he tested positive for COVID-19 late Thursday evening. On Sunday, Trump had said in a video posted on Twitter from Walter Reed that he was getting \u00e2\u0080\u009cgreat reports\u00e2\u0080\u009d from the doctors. He then traveled by motorcade past cheering supporters near the suburban Washington military hospital, waving from the back seat while wearing a face mask and giving the crowds his signature thumbs-up. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } James Phillips, doctor of emergency medicine at George Washington University and attending physician at Walter Reed, took to Twitter to express dismay: \u00e2\u0080\u009cEvery single person in the vehicle during that completely unnecessary Presidential \u00e2\u0080\u0098drive-by\u00e2\u0080\u0099 just now has to be quarantined for 14 days,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey might get sick. They may die.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Phillips said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor political theater. Commanded by Trump to put their lives at risk for theater. This is insanity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Phillips added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat Presidential SUV is not only bulletproof, but hermetically sealed against chemical attack. The risk of COVID19 transmission inside is as high as it gets outside of medical procedures. The irresponsibility is astounding. My thoughts are with the Secret Service forced to play.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Read: President Trump is prescribed a third drug to combat his COVID-19 infection \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098Our current best estimates tell us about 10% of the global population may have been infected by this virus. It varies depending on country, it varies from urban to rural, it varies depending on groups. But what it does mean is that the vast majority of the world remains at risk. We are now heading into a difficult period. The disease continues to spread.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Dr. Michael Ryan, World Health Organization The move came on a day when the U.S. added another 34,491 new cases and at least 332 deaths, according to a New York Times tracker. In the last week, new cases have averaged 43,586 a day, up 6% from the average two weeks earlier. The U.S. has the highest case tally in the world at 7.4 million, according to JHU data, and the highest death toll at about a fifth of the global total of 1.04 million. The U.S. accounts for just 4% of the global population. About two-thirds of U.S. states saw an increase in new cases in the last week, according to a Washington Post analysis, suggesting colder weather is driving people indoors, where there is greater risk of transmission. The highest increases on a per capita basis were in the Midwest and Mountain West, including in Wisconsin, Iowa, Utah and the Dakotas, the paper reported. Raymond James analysts said Monday that hospitalizations are on the rise in the U.S., too, with the average daily number up 2.6% in the past week. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe uptick in hospitalizations, a lagging indicator, is concerning and could be a sign of the growing next phase of COVID in the U.S.,\u00e2\u0080\u009d analysts led by Chris Meekins wrote in a note to clients. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMeanwhile, average daily tests increased by around 5% compared to last week while average daily identified cases decreased by around 2%, causing the 7-day average positivity rate to fall from 5.0% to 4.7%. As we continue to anticipate varying trends, we encourage individuals to practice strong mitigation measures so that we do not further increase the virus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strain on our health care system.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Read: Expert calls for \u00e2\u0080\u0098radical transparency\u00e2\u0080\u0099 on Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coronavirus treatment and progress as more in president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s circle test positive Global trends are also discouraging, according to Meekins. The number of new cases worldwide rose 6.3% last week to more than 2 million, while fatalities rose 3.9% to 39,257. Governments in Europe are considering new measures to restrict movement after a fresh surge in cases across the continent. The World Health Organization said Monday that roughly one in 10 people may have been infected with the novel coronavirus by now \u00e2\u0080\u0094 meaning most of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population is still vulnerable. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur current best estimates tell us about 10% of the global population may have been infected by this virus,\u00e2\u0080\u009d WHO top emergency expert Dr. Michael Ryan told the executive board, as the Guardian reported. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt varies depending on country, it varies from urban to rural, it varies depending on groups. But what it does mean is that the vast majority of the world remains at risk. We are now heading into a difficult period. The disease continues to spread,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. In other news: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Bars and caf\u00c3\u00a9s in Paris will be closed for two weeks under new measures being imposed to stop the spread of the virus, according to local media reports. Paris has been hit by rising cases, increasing hospitalizations and deaths months after it lifted a nationwide lockdown. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese are braking measures because the epidemic is moving too fast,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Paris police chief Didier Lallement told journalists. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom tomorrow, all bars will be closed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d France counted nearly 17,000 new cases on Saturday alone, the highest number since it started widespread testing. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 The official U.K. COVID-19 tally spiked this weekend \u00e2\u0080\u0094 because of a backlog caused by a Microsoft Excel error. According to Public Health England, 15,841 cases between Sept. 25 and Oct. 2 weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t uploaded to the government dashboard, because the column limits on an Excel spreadsheet reached the maximum size. The mistake was made worse because those details weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t passed to the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s test-and-trace operations. The issue has been solved by splitting the Excel files into batches, according to the Daily Mail. The U.K. case tally has now passed 500,000, and stands at 518,214 and its death toll is 42,440, the highest in Europe and fifth highest in the world, the Johns Hopkins data show. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Russia reported 10,499 new infections on Sunday, the highest number of new cases since May 15 at the peak of the crisis when lockdowns were still in effect, the Guardian reported. Moscow is now considering another strict lockdown to curb the spread, according to the newspaper Vedomosti. Russia has 1.2 million cases, fourth highest in the world, and 21,375 fatalities. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, is self-quarantining until Tuesday after being told she had participated in a meeting last week attended by a person who has since tested positive for COVID-19, German broadcaster Deutsche Welle reported. Von der Leyen tested negative on Monday, but she will remain isolated as a precaution. Latest tallies There are now 35.3 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, the Johns Hopkins data show, and at least 24.6 million people have recovered. Brazil has the second highest death toll after the U.S. at 146,352, but third highest case tally at 4.9 million. India is second to the U.S. by case tally at 6.6 million, and has the third highest death toll at 102,685. Mexico is fourth with 79,088 deaths and ninth with 761,665 cases. China, where the illness was first reported late last year, has 90,640 cases and 4,739 fatalities, according to its official numbers. What are companies saying? \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 3M Co.

The company also said it has identified cost savings of at least $10 million to $20 million on an annual run-rate basis by end fiscal 2023. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe costs to implement such opportunities are likely to be recognized during the latter part of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and during fiscal 2022,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the company said in a regulator filing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese SG&A reduction opportunities are in addition to the cost savings actions, of $40 million on an annualized basis, referenced in the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second quarter earnings release, dated September 17, 2020.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Fantasy sports and sports betting operator DraftKings Inc.
