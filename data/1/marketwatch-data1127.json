On Monday, Trump tweeted that he would leave Walter Reed Medical Center in the evening. He urged people \"don't be afraid of COVID\" and \"don't let it dominate your life,\" as some \"really great drugs\" have been developed under his administration. \"I feel better than I did 20 years ago!,\" Trump said. Meanwhile, the latest U.S. death toll from COVID-19 was 209,938, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University, which is roughly 2,600 more than the total reported by MarketWatch on Thursday afternoon. Trump had tweeted that he tested positive for COVID-19 late Thursday evening. On Sunday, Trump had said in a video posted on Twitter from Walter Reed that he was getting \"great reports\" from the doctors. He then traveled by motorcade past cheering supporters near the suburban Washington military hospital, waving from the back seat while wearing a face mask and giving the crowds his signature thumbs-up. iframe.twitter-tweet { width: 100% !important; } James Phillips, doctor of emergency medicine at George Washington University and attending physician at Walter Reed, took to Twitter to express dismay: \"Every single person in the vehicle during that completely unnecessary Presidential 'drive-by' just now has to be quarantined for 14 days,\" he said. \"They might get sick. They may die.\" Phillips said, \"For political theater. Commanded by Trump to put their lives at risk for theater. This is insanity.\" Phillips added, \"That Presidential SUV is not only bulletproof, but hermetically sealed against chemical attack. The risk of COVID19 transmission inside is as high as it gets outside of medical procedures. The irresponsibility is astounding. My thoughts are with the Secret Service forced to play.\" Read: President Trump is prescribed a third drug to combat his COVID-19 infection \u201c 'Our current best estimates tell us about 10% of the global population may have been infected by this virus. It varies depending on country, it varies from urban to rural, it varies depending on groups. But what it does mean is that the vast majority of the world remains at risk. We are now heading into a difficult period. The disease continues to spread.' \u201d - Dr. Michael Ryan, World Health Organization The move came on a day when the U.S. added another 34,491 new cases and at least 332 deaths, according to a New York Times tracker. In the last week, new cases have averaged 43,586 a day, up 6% from the average two weeks earlier. The U.S. has the highest case tally in the world at 7.4 million, according to JHU data, and the highest death toll at about a fifth of the global total of 1.04 million. The U.S. accounts for just 4% of the global population. About two-thirds of U.S. states saw an increase in new cases in the last week, according to a Washington Post analysis, suggesting colder weather is driving people indoors, where there is greater risk of transmission. The highest increases on a per capita basis were in the Midwest and Mountain West, including in Wisconsin, Iowa, Utah and the Dakotas, the paper reported. Raymond James analysts said Monday that hospitalizations are on the rise in the U.S., too, with the average daily number up 2.6% in the past week. \"The uptick in hospitalizations, a lagging indicator, is concerning and could be a sign of the growing next phase of COVID in the U.S.,\" analysts led by Chris Meekins wrote in a note to clients. \"Meanwhile, average daily tests increased by around 5% compared to last week while average daily identified cases decreased by around 2%, causing the 7-day average positivity rate to fall from 5.0% to 4.7%. As we continue to anticipate varying trends, we encourage individuals to practice strong mitigation measures so that we do not further increase the virus's strain on our health care system.\" Read: Expert calls for 'radical transparency' on Trump's coronavirus treatment and progress as more in president's circle test positive Global trends are also discouraging, according to Meekins. The number of new cases worldwide rose 6.3% last week to more than 2 million, while fatalities rose 3.9% to 39,257. Governments in Europe are considering new measures to restrict movement after a fresh surge in cases across the continent. The World Health Organization said Monday that roughly one in 10 people may have been infected with the novel coronavirus by now - meaning most of the world's population is still vulnerable. \"Our current best estimates tell us about 10% of the global population may have been infected by this virus,\" WHO top emergency expert Dr. Michael Ryan told the executive board, as the Guardian reported. \"It varies depending on country, it varies from urban to rural, it varies depending on groups. But what it does mean is that the vast majority of the world remains at risk. We are now heading into a difficult period. The disease continues to spread,\" he said.

Paris has been hit by rising cases, increasing hospitalizations and deaths months after it lifted a nationwide lockdown. \"These are braking measures because the epidemic is moving too fast,\" Paris police chief Didier Lallement told journalists. \"From tomorrow, all bars will be closed.\" France counted nearly 17,000 new cases on Saturday alone, the highest number since it started widespread testing. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 The official U.K. COVID-19 tally spiked this weekend - because of a backlog caused by a Microsoft Excel error. According to Public Health England, 15,841 cases between Sept. 25 and Oct. 2 weren't uploaded to the government dashboard, because the column limits on an Excel spreadsheet reached the maximum size. The mistake was made worse because those details weren't passed to the country's test-and-trace operations. The issue has been solved by splitting the Excel files into batches, according to the Daily Mail. The U.K. case tally has now passed 500,000, and stands at 518,214 and its death toll is 42,440, the highest in Europe and fifth highest in the world, the Johns Hopkins data show. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Russia reported 10,499 new infections on Sunday, the highest number of new cases since May 15 at the peak of the crisis when lockdowns were still in effect, the Guardian reported.
