(Photo: Wilfredo Lee/AP) Amid a pandemic that has made indoor crowds unsavory, many voters are seeking alternatives to casting their ballots at polling places on Election Day, and several states have expanded opportunities to vote by mail. About half of registered voters plan to cast their ballots early \u00e2\u0080\u0094 30% by mail and 20% through in-person early voting \u00e2\u0080\u0094 while 43% say they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll vote in person on Nov. 3, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll.\u00c2 Democratic nominee Joe Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s backers are far more likely than President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supporters to report a vote-by-mail preference, the survey found, as well as more likely to express confidence that the election results will be counted accurately. Trump once again sought to cast doubt on the validity of the upcoming election during the first presidential debate, claiming, without specific evidence, that there is fraud in mail-in voting. Trump said he was \u00e2\u0080\u009ccounting\u00e2\u0080\u009d on the Supreme Court to \u00e2\u0080\u009clook at the ballots.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Biden said Trump is \u00e2\u0080\u009cjust afraid of counting the votes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Experts have said fraudulent ballots are rare. In August, postmaster general and Trump ally Louis DeJoy defended his move to institute cost-cutting measures within the U.S. Postal Service that resulted in delays. DeJoy then said he would suspend his operational changes until after the election\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conclusion \u00e2\u0080\u009cto avoid even the appearance of any impact on election mail,\u00e2\u0080\u009d though Democrats still had plenty of questions for him in contentious hearings on Capitol Hill.\u00c2 Wary about voting by mail? Wondering how difficult it might be to vote in person? Here are answers to some of the questions you might have, according to voter-engagement advocates and experts.Should I vote in person or by mail? How should I make my decision? The decision will depend on your own personal circumstances and the voting options available in your state, said Jeanette Senecal, the senior director of mission impact for the League of Women Voters, a nonpartisan group that encourages voter participation. Most states currently offer any eligible voter the opportunity to vote by mail, including a handful of states now allowing voters to use COVID-19 as an excuse. But their exact processes \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that is, whether voters are automatically mailed ballots, automatically mailed applications for mail-in ballots, or must obtain the application themselves \u00e2\u0080\u0094 vary widely, as do their deadlines. And in six states, voters seeking to cast an absentee ballot must still furnish a non-COVID-19-related excuse. If voting by mail isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a possibility for you, see if your state allows you to vote early in person. Otherwise, head to the polls on Election Day, equipped with a mask and ready to exercise whatever precautions your community requires to prevent the spread of COVID-19, said Brian Miller, the executive director of Nonprofit VOTE, a nonpartisan group that partners with nonprofits to boost voter participation. \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098What mail-in voting does do is provide a safe way to vote amid COVID \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and, added bonus, it boosts turnout overall as a long-term policy and it gives people a chance to study the ballot and make informed decisions.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Brian Miller, executive director of Nonprofit VOTE \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople should vote in whatever way feels most comfortable to them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Vincent Hutchings, a University of Michigan political scientist, told MarketWatch in an email. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy polling place is not typically very crowded, so I have voted in person recently. However, for others (particular those with preexisting conditions) it may make sense to vote by mail.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Whatever voting option you choose, experts say, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crucial to plan ahead and begin the process as early as possible. Make sure you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re registered to vote at your current address well in advance of the election, particularly if your address has changed recently, Miller said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you think that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re probably going to vote by mail, request your application early. Send it back early. Call early to see if they received it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Myrna P\u00c3\u00a9rez, the director of the Brennan Center for Justice\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voting rights and elections program. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo the extent to which your state allows early voting, take advantage of it. If it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t allow early voting, get there as early in the day [on Election Day] as you can.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Be aware that rules in some states are subject to change pending the outcome of a number of lawsuits, said Senecal, who recommended voters consult the League of Women Voters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Vote411 resource for up-to-date rules in their state. Look up your polling site in advance, as many have changed locations due to the pandemic, Miller added.What are the major mail-in voting pitfalls I need to watch out for? The biggest challenge posed by mail-in voting is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new to many people and often a multi-step process, Miller said \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but by and large, he added, the pros significantly outweigh the cons. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat mail-in voting does do is provide a safe way to vote amid COVID \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and, added bonus, it boosts turnout overall as a long-term policy and it gives people a chance to study the ballot and make informed decisions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Request your ballot early and pay close attention to all instructions and technical requirements. Affix the appropriate postage to return your ballot, if necessary; correctly handle the envelopes provided; and sign your name wherever indicated. Be aware that your state might require your signature to match what the government has on file, and try to match it to the signature on your driver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s license or your voter registration form if possible, Senecal said. See if your state has a process to fix signature discrepancies. As for your ballot, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccomplete it early, send it back quickly, call the election office to see if they got it, and then ask if it was counted,\u00e2\u0080\u009d P\u00c3\u00a9rez said. If the answer is no, ask why not and what you can do to fix it, she added \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and do all of this before Election Day, if at all possible. The only difficulty posed by mail-in voting, Hutchings said, is being mindful of the deadline to request your mail-in ballot. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOtherwise, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a perfectly safe and convenient way to vote,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Nearly all states allow voters to drop off voted absentee ballots at local election officials\u00e2\u0080\u0099 offices, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures; check to see if your state allows for dropoff at additional locations or offers ballot drop boxes. Forty-one states and the District of Columbia also let voters track their ballots after voting by mail, according to data compiled by NBC News. Where available, this feature can help reassure voters anxious about an unfamiliar process, Miller said.\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt works just like a UPS UPS, +0.27% or FedEx FDX, +0.18% tracking number \u00e2\u0080\u0094 you just key it in on a website and it tells you where your ballot is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA combination of making sure you cast that ballot early and using that ballot-tracking tool gives you the confidence that your ballot is being received and counted.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIf I choose to vote in person, what are my rights at my polling place? What obstacles could I encounter? Voters are entitled to cast a ballot without interference, intimidation or discrimination, P\u00c3\u00a9rez said. Some states require voters to present photo ID, Miller added, and some also prohibit voters from wearing political apparel to the polls \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2 so leave your Biden/Harris T-shirt or MAGA hat at home. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be deterred by lines that look a lot longer than usual, Miller said, as they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re likely the result of social-distancing mandates and may move quickly. If you encounter an obstacle while voting in person, Hutchings added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou generally have a right to fill out a provisional ballot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098The vast majority of Americans wait mere moments. But voters of color, at least in 2018, waited longer.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Myrna P\u00c3\u00a9rez, director of the Brennan Center for Justice\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voting rights and elections program How long should I expect to be at my polling place? How should I prepare and what should I bring? If you live in an area with widespread polling-site closures, a lack of easy vote-by-mail options, and a history of long lines at polling locations, be prepared for the possibility of a long line, Miller said. Bring a water bottle. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe vast majority of Americans wait mere moments,\u00e2\u0080\u009d P\u00c3\u00a9rez said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut voters of color, at least in 2018, waited longer. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Not only did they wait longer, they were more disproportionately likely to be in the longest of lines.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be deterred by hiccups on Election Day, P\u00c3\u00a9rez said. Make sure you have a ride to the polls, she said; if necessary, make arrangements with your employer to allow for extra time to stand in line, and try to line up backup child care. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe most important thing for a voter to know is that if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re standing in a line when the polls close, they are entitled to vote,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Senecal said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo if there is a long line and they have the time to stay in line, we encourage them to do so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bring your own personal protective equipment, hand sanitizer, and blue or black pen, Senecal added. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend voting during off-peak hours, preparing any necessary documents or forms before arriving at the poll site, and filling out a sample ballot at home to expedite the process of casting your actual ballot. \u201c \u00e2\u0080\u0098If there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one big misconception this election cycle, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that mail-in voting is somehow fraudulent or unreliable. There is no evidence that either claim is true.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Vincent Hutchings, a University of Michigan political scientist How worried should I be about voter fraud with mail-in ballots? President Trump has claimed without evidence that expanded mail-in voting would lead to widespread voter fraud, though many state and local Republicans have promoted it as a safe way to vote during the pandemic. Voter fraud isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t nonexistent, but studies suggest it is relatively rare: An American Political Science Review study published this year, for instance, estimated that \u00e2\u0080\u009cat most, only 1 in 4,000 votes cast in 2012 were double votes\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 suggesting that \u00e2\u0080\u009cdouble voting is not currently carried out in such a systematic way that it presents a threat to the integrity of American elections,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the authors wrote. Out of some 14.6 million votes cast by mail in 2016 and 2018, only 372 potential instances of voting on behalf of a dead person or double voting emerged, according to a Washington Post analysis of data from Oregon, Colorado and Washington, states that automatically send voters ballots. And Stanford University research published this spring found that vote-by-mail programs didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to impact either party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s turnout share or boost either party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vote share. Meanwhile, a Federal Bureau of Investigation official told reporters Wednesday that the agency hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen \u00e2\u0080\u009ca coordinated national voter fraud effort during a major election\u00e2\u0080\u009d to date, ABC News reported. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are numerous security features in place, and the evidence of fraud is very scant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d P\u00c3\u00a9rez said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEvery credible expert thinks that vote-by-mail has to be one of the solutions to the challenge that our country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s facing in this moment.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhen should we expect the election results? Be patient and manage your expectations. Due to the expected deluge of mail-in votes, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likely we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know the results the morning after Election Day \u00e2\u0080\u009cunless it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a blowout,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Miller said. Plus, under the 12th Amendment and the Electoral Count Act, states actually have five weeks to tally their popular-vote results, he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not \u00e2\u0080\u0098delayed\u00e2\u0080\u0099 until it exceeds that Dec. 8 deadline,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Miller said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf states need three to four weeks to count the ballots, so be it \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more important that we get an accurate count than know on the morning of Nov. 4.\u00e2\u0080\u009d If the process is taking some time, he added, that means it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being done well.What misconceptions do people have about voting in this particular election? \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one big misconception this election cycle, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that mail-in voting is somehow fraudulent or unreliable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hutchings said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is no evidence that either claim is true.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Voting by mail \u00e2\u0080\u009cis not a new thing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Miller said \u00e2\u0080\u0094 after all, it began during the Civil War, and nearly one in four votes cast in 2018 was by mail. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is not an untested method,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been around for a while, and it works.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This story was updated on Sept. 30, 2020."}]}
