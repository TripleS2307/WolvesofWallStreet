Getty Images Nvidia Corp. shares were up more than 5% on Monday after the company announced it would be acquiring Arm Ltd. from Softbank Group Corp. in a deal, valued at $40 billion in cash and stock, that one analyst said could be \u00e2\u0080\u009ctransformational.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The acquisition of a microprocessor-design company would put Nvidia NVDA, -0.54% into direct competition with Intel Corp. INTC, -1.03% and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, -3.94% in developing brain chips that make up the heart of servers and personal computers. The hope is that Nvidia will become an even stronger power in the data center by combining its graphics processor with Arm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s central processing unit (CPU) designs.\u00c2 Analysts seemed excited about potential for the combination while raising some big questions about how the merger will play out.\u00c2 \u00c2 Nvidia Chief Exexutive Jensen Huang \u00e2\u0080\u009cis probably in for the battle of his life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the view of Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. The company will have to obtain approvals from \u00e2\u0080\u009cvirtually everywhere given the ubiquity of Arm licensees world-wide,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote. This includes the U.S., the U.K., the EU, and China.\u00c2 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unclear whether the U.K. or the EU will be as warm to the deal as the U.S. may be, and the company will likely have to make a continued commitment to spending in the U.K., just as Softbank 9984, -1.24% did when it acquired Arm in 2016. Arm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expense growth vastly exceeded its revenue growth after that, Rasgon said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthough this investment strategy was of course deliberate (and partially required as a condition of the British government allowing the original sale to Softbank).\u00e2\u0080\u009d Opinion:\u00c2 The pandemic has brought the personal computer back to life, with help from Zoom Nvidia might also face pushback from Arm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current customer base. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlready we believe that interest in other alternatives (such as RISC-V) has been increasing as Arm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fate has become nebulous, and there would seem to be risk that independent ownership (by Nvidia or any other semi company) could potentially impair the current value of the asset,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote.\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have to admit that we have found the idea of NVDA, or any individual semiconductor company, buying ARM to be a bit of a head-scratcher, as the current value proposition of ARM stems from their independence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rasgon wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t totally pessimistic on the combination, writing that if the company \u00e2\u0080\u009ccan pull it off\u00e2\u0080\u009d then Nvidia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cdominance will be extended into virtually every important compute domain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He also wrote that he was \u00e2\u0080\u009cinclined to grant the benefit of the doubt\u00e2\u0080\u009d while granting some praise for \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe boldness of the action\u00e2\u0080\u009d and reiterating his outperform rating and $545 price target.\u00c2 Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse took a similar view, arguing that the two companies together would make for \u00e2\u0080\u009ca powerful combination\u00e2\u0080\u009d though deal approval could be tricky.\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere will likely be many players who complain about this deal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote prior to the official deal announcement, including China, the U.K., and existing Arm licensees like Qualcomm Inc. QCOM, +2.06%, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, +0.90%, and Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.74% \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe would think a time to close, at a minimum, would be 18 months.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2 He maintained an overweight rating and $600 price target on the shares.\u00c2 Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis was more upbeat, writing that the deal could be \u00e2\u0080\u009ctransformative\u00e2\u0080\u009d and raising his price target on the stock to $680 from $570. The new target is the highest listed on FactSet. The merger puts Nvidia in a position \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot just to capture 80% of the ecosystem value in the data center, but also unify the compute ecosystem between the edge and data center,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote. He estimates that the company has five-year earnings-per-share power of $50 and reiterated a buy rating on the stock.\u00c2 \u00c2 Nvidia shares have risen 43% over the past three months as the S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% has gained 12%."}]}
