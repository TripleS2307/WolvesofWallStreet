Read: IPO market gears up for busiest week since May of 2019 \u2014 Uber\u2019s IPO week \u2014 with 12 deals on tap \u201cThat\u2019s another positive affecting the market today,\u201d said John Carey, director of U.S. equity income at Amundi Pioneer, of the slate of IPO and large batch of corporate tie-ups announced over the weekend. \u201cOtherwise, we\u2019ve got terrible fires in the Western part of the country that\u2019s just devastating, civil unrest and an acrimonious political environment as this campaign season heats up,\u201d he told MarketWatch. \u201cCertainly, other things could be front-and-center any other week,\u201d he said, adding that instead it\u2019s \u201coff to the races.\u201d President Donald Trump visited the Sacramento, Calif., area on Monday and argued with Wade Crowfoot, California\u2019s secretary for natural resources, about climate change\u2019s role in the wildfires raging in the West.

Notably, AstraZeneca PLC AZN, +1.16% said over the weekend that U.K. clinical trials for its experimental coronavirus vaccine resumed after trials were paused due to an unexplained illness contracted by one of the participants who was given the vaccine. However, a restart of the trials in the U.S. remains on hold until at least midweek, until the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and a safety panel investigate the case, Reuters reported.

At the same time, some investors say they aren\u2019t getting overconfident about the prospects of a coronavirus vaccine, as it remains unclear how swiftly a successful remedy could be produced in mass quantities and distributed widely. \u201cThe arrival of a vaccine will be a game-changer. But even if we start to see anything near broad distribution in the first quarter of next year, the turnaround is going to be gradual. As we have seen with testing, getting broad distribution and ubiquitous access isn\u2019t trivial,\u201d said James Meyer, chief investment officer at Tower Bridge Advisors. Shares of Oracle Corp.
