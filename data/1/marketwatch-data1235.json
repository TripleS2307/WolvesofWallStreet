Nasdaq clinches another record", "body": "U.S. stocks closed mostly lower Monday, but with Wall Street recording its strongest August return in decades, as vaccine hopes kept investors pushing equities to fresh highs. Shaking off moderate weakness elsewhere, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ended higher, pushing further into record territory.How did stock benchmarks perform? The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% shed 223.82 points, or 0.8%, to end at 28,430.05. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.87% fell 7.70 points, or 0.2%, ending at 3,500.31, after touching an intraday record of 3,514.77. The Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39% rose 79.82 points, 0.7%, to end at a record 11,775.46, after also setting a new intraday all-time high of 11,829.84. Over the past five months, the Dow\u2019s advanced 29.7%, its biggest 5-month percent gain since July 2009, while the S&P 500 added 35.4%, its best 5-month run since October 1938. The Nasdaq outperformed, advancing 52.9%, booking its strongest 5 months since March 2000, according to Dow Jones Market Data. What drove the market? The S&P 500 clinched its best August return since 1986 and the Dow its best return for that month since 1984, while the Nasdaq recorded its strongest August since 2000. Much of the strength has been attributed to hopes for vaccines and treatments for the COVID-19 pandemic that has debilitated economies across the globe. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq have continued to notch records as risk assets shrug off the economic damage wrought by the coronavirus. Read:COVID-19 vaccine hopes are driving the stock market rally \u2014 here\u2019s how much \u201cOver the course of the next eight weeks, we\u2019re going to have a raft of announcements on a vaccine. If they are all positive, it\u2019s going to trump everything,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial, in an interview. Adding to the optimism around potential coronavirus cures, the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s commissioner, Stephen Hahn, said the U.S. could fast-track a trio of vaccines. The FDA boss, in a weekend interview with the Financial Times, insisted there are safe ways to make a vaccine available before the end of final stage trials\u2014potentially by issuing an emergency authorization for use by certain groups, rather than achieving a blanket approval. Still, this comes ahead of a seasonally weak month for stocks in September, which could be amplified by worries about a COVID-19 resurgence in the fall and winter, by the stalemate in Congress over additional pandemic aid and by turbulence fostered by the U.S. presidential election race between former Vice President Joe Biden and incumbent President Donald Trump. Mark Hulbert: The stock market is on a tear, but now comes September, the worst month of the year \u201cAs some of the fiscal measures put in place begin to wear off, the need for additional fiscal stimulus only increases,\u201d Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist at Allianz Investment Management, wrote Monday. \u201cAt the end of the day, the speed of the recovery rests in the hands of politicians as they wrangle over the details in the next round of fiscal stimulus spending.\u201d What\u2019s more, the closely tracked CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX VIX, -5.15% rose 14.5% Monday, and also has climbed in October ahead of each of the past seven presidential election years since 1992, according to Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services, who notes that \u201csome observers are now questioning whether a pullback at some point is even possible while the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy remains so accommodative. \u201cOur response is an unequivocal yes,\u201d Lerner wrote in a client note Monday. Trading on Monday also followed last week\u2019s important declaration by the Federal Reserve that it would use an average inflation target as a part of its monetary-policy. The shift implies the central bank would pursue lower rates for a longer period, even if the unemployment rate, which is historically associated with rising price pressures, started to fall substantially. Read: Fed adopts new strategy to allow higher inflation and welcome strong labor markets Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida on Monday defended the central bank\u2019s shift to average inflation targeting. He said the link between inflation and the unemployment rate, known to economists as the Phillips Curve, began to lose its predictive power more than a decade ago. \u201cFor a long time now, many have been asking whether the Phillips curve is dead,\u201d wrote Kristina Hooper, Invesco\u2019s chief global market strategist, in commentary Monday. \u201cLast week, the Fed answered affirmatively \u2014 at least it believes that\u2019s what recent history has proven.\u201d See: Fed\u2019s Clarida says new inflation-fighting strategy has roots in failure of old approach Meanwhile, China on Friday unveiled new restrictions on artificial-intelligence technology exports that could further complicate the sale of TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations, as the Trump administration tries to quickly find a buyer.
