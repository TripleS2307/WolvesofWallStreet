Nikola Corp. The founder and executive chairman of embattled electric truck maker Nikola, Trevor Milton, has voluntarily resigned, the company said Monday. \u201cNikola is truly in my blood and always will be, and the focus should be on the Company and its world-changing mission, not me,\u201d said Milton, who will also be stepping down from the company\u2019s board of directors. according to a company press release. \u201cSo I made the difficult decision to approach the Board and volunteer to step aside as Executive Chairman. Founding Nikola and growing it into a company that will change transportation for the better and help protect our world\u2019s climate has been an incredible honor.\u201d Nikola shares plunged nearly 30% in premarket trade, set to open at a four-month low. Stephen Girsky, former vice chairman of General Motors and a member of Nikola\u2019s NKLA, -1.36% Board, has been appointed chairman of the board, effective immediately. \u201cWe\u2019ve built a deep bench of talent over the years, and I am confident that Nikola\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Mark Russell, supported by Chief Financial Officer, Kim Brady, and the rest of the leadership team will advance our goal of making Nikola the global leader in zero-emissions transportation,\u201d added Milton. Mark Russell, Nikola\u2019s chief executive officer, said the company\u2019s priorities \u201cremain unchanged.\u201d News of Milton\u2019s departure surfaced on trade publication FreightWaves late Sunday. The report said Milton, who is a major shareholder in the company, decided to step down to prevent to shield the company and his investments. Investors in the hydrogen-powered truck maker have been on a roller-coaster ride this month. Shares surged over 40% on Sept. 8 after the group announced a billion-dollar deal with General Motors GM. Nikola shares fell sharply on Sept. 10 and 11 after a report from short-seller Hindenburg Research that Nikola had misled investors. Nikola has refuted those claims, though to the allegations it filmed a truck rolling down a hill, the company said it never stated it was driving under its own propulsion. Nikola took another hit after a Sept. 14 report from Bloomberg News that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the short-seller claims. Nikola responded by saying it had \u201cproactively contacted and briefed\u201d the SEC about Hindenburg\u2019s report, claiming it was designed to manipulate the market to benefit short sellers. In a statement, Nikola said it \u201cwelcomes the SEC\u2019s involvement in this matter.\u201d The Wall Street Journal reported on Sept. 15 that the Justice Department had joined U.S. securities regulators in that probe. Representatives of the SEC and Manhattan U.S. attorney\u2019s office and Nikola declined to comment to the WSJ, For September so far, Nikola has lost 16%, but have soared 231% for 2020 so far. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said Milton\u2019s exit was \u201cshocking,\u201d and will leave investors with some \u201cwhite knuckles,\u201d in a note to clients. He said Nikola\u2019s partnership with with General Motors will be a \u201clinchpin to its success.\u201d \u201cTrevor stepping down voluntarily at Nikola will be perceived by the Street as a major near-term gut punch for the company\u2019s lofty EV ambitions as he plays a key role strategically in driving the company\u2019s vision,\u201d Ives wrote in a note to clients. \u201cIn a nutshell, Nikola is still a \u2018prove me\u2019 stock, which speaks to why we are watching this from the sidelines with a neutral rating until we can get more confidence in the EV and hydrogen fuel cell execution story over the next 12 to 18 months.\u201d Tomi Kilgore contriubuted to this report"}]}
