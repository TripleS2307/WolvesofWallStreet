The final consumer sentiment survey in August rose to 74.1 from a preliminary reading of 72.8, the University of Michigan said Friday. It was also up from July\u2019s 72.5 score. The survey is still near a pandemic low, however. The index bottomed out at 71.8 in April, just two months after it had reached a nearly two-year high of 101.

Still, most Americans think it will be years before the economy returns to normal. \u201cAlthough half anticipates an improved economy, when asked to judge the performance of the economy, 62% judged that the overall conditions in the economy could be best described as unfavorable,\u201d said Richard Curtin, the chief economist of the sentiment survey. The big picture: The amount of confidence Americans have in the economy and their own financial security has a good record of predicting the future. The low level of sentiment points to a rockier road ahead for a U.S. recovery with unemployment still high, layoffs and furloughs on the rise again and Washington divided over what kind of additional aid to provide for the economy.
