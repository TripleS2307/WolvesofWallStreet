Net profit at the German engineering conglomerate fell to 539 million euros ($639.4 million) for the period ended June 30 from EUR1.03 billion a year earlier. The result was effected by a loss from Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy SA and a higher income tax rate, said the company. At Siemens' industrial business, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and amortization increased 8% to EUR1.79 billion, partly due to \"a strong performance\" at Digital Industries, while the adjusted Ebita margin for the division rose to 14.3%. Analysts had expected EUR1.17 billion for the segment's adjusted Ebita. Siemens said revenue for the quarter was EUR13.49 billion compared with EUR14.24 billion for the year-earlier period. Orders fell to EUR14.40 billion due to the pandemic, Siemens said. For the fiscal year, it continues to expect a moderate decline in comparable revenue. \"While we expect the economic consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic to continue to strongly impact our fiscal fourth quarter financial results, macroeconomic developments and their influence on Siemens still cannot be reliably assessed,\" it said.
