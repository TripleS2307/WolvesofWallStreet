And the selling wasn\u2019t limited to technology stocks \u2014 small-caps RUT, +0.55% and value stocks VLUE, -0.50% also fell. Only a few hard-hit travel stocks actually rose. \u201cStock markets got a well overdue thumping with big tech leading the way south. The technical expression is a downward correction in overbought stocks after an intense period of one-way price action higher,\u201d says Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst, Asia Pacific, at Oanda. \u201cFor the rest of us, the market was long and wrong, and now some of their P&L [profit and loss] is gone.\u201d A chart from Bespoke Investment Group neatly encapsulates the fact that the winners were sold. Eddy Elfenbein of the Crossing Wall Street blog says these sorts of days aren\u2019t unusual in the middle of rallies. \u201cContra-trend rallies are typical within larger rallies, but we can\u2019t say that this spells the end of the superstar stock rally. Clearly, there are nervous investors out there, and the bears have shown they\u2019re willing to push back,\u201d he says. Dan Ives, the veteran tech sector analyst at Wedbush Securities, isn\u2019t shaken. \u201cWhile [Thursday\u2019s] massive sell off will cause some white knuckles on the Street as fears of a tech bubble and stretched valuations become the talk of the town, we continue to believe the secular growth themes around the tech sector are unprecedented with the COVID backdrop accelerating growth stories by 1-2 years in some cases,\u201d Ives says. \u201cWhile much good news has been baked into these names, we view pullbacks like today as opportunities to own the secular growth stories in cloud, cybersecurity, and tech stalwart FAANG names,\u201d he says, with FAANG representing Facebook FB, +0.26%, Amazon AMZN, +3.01%, Apple, Netflix NFLX, +1.43% and Google owner Alphabet GOOG, +1.97%. Ives says the second phase of the economic rebound, during the second half of this year and into 2021, will \u201csupercharge\u201d the fundamentals and growth trajectories of well positioned tech stocks. \u201cWe view this next phase resulting in Street numbers moving higher and a further rerating of tech stocks as the \u2018risk on\u2019 trade and hunt for secular growth stories will be the focus for tech investors looking out as we head into the fall, despite volatility and general nervousness around U.S./China trade tensions and the November elections,\u201d says Ives. He says investors should focus on Apple AAPL, +1.74% and Microsoft MSFT, +2.48%. \u201cFor Apple, while the services business has been a Rock of Gibraltar for [Chief Executive Tim] Cook & Co., now the drumroll shifts to a massive pent-up demand for smartphone upgrades heading into its iPhone 12 5G supercycle slated to kick off in the early October time-frame,\u201d Ives says. As for Microsoft, \u201cthis cloud shift and [work-from-home] dynamic looks here to stay, and the company stands to be a major beneficiary of this trend on its flagship Azure/Office 365 franchise over the coming years,\u201d he says. The buzz The U.S. economy added 1.37 million jobs in August, a bit faster than the 1.2 million forecast by economists, as the unemployment rate fell sharply to 8.4%. The jobs growth figure was helped by 238,000 temporary 2020 Census workers. \u201cThe broadly positive reading will provide welcome relief to jittery markets as it serves as further evidence of an economic recovery, with the fall in the unemployment rate being the highlight,\u201d said Sam Cooper, vice president of market risk solutions at Silicon Valley Bank. Among the unemployed, the number of persons on temporary layoff decreased by 3.1 million in August to 6.2 million, but the number of permanent job losers increased by 534,000 to 3.4 million. Outside of payrolls, Broadcom AVGO, +0.90% late on Thursday reported stronger-than-forecast earnings, as demand from cloud and telecom customers helped the semiconductor and industrial software maker. The markets The S&P 500 ES00, +1.13% contract was outperforming the Nasdaq-100 NQ00, +1.63% a day after the big selloff. Asian ADOW, +0.18% stocks fell, while European stocks SXXP, +0.55% edged higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.777% edged up 0.67% after the jobs report.
