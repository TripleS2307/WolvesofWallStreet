Under a deal, Microsoft would end up owning and operating TikTok operations in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Microsoft said other American investors may take a minority stake. \u201cThis new structure would build on the experience TikTok users currently love, while adding world-class security, privacy, and digital safety protections,\u201d Microsoft said. \u201cAmong other measures, Microsoft would ensure that all private data of TikTok\u2019s American users is transferred to and remains in the United States.\u201d Microsoft added that talks are still preliminary and may not result in a deal, and that it will have no further comment on the matter until there is \u201ca definitive outcome\u201d to the discussions. The Wall Street Journal reported Saturday that the talks had been put on hold after opposition from Trump. Last week, the president threatened to ban the popular video app from operating in the U.S. due to national security concerns. On Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said TikTok was not the only Chinese-owned software company in the White House\u2019s cross-hairs, and that Trump would \u201ctake care of\u201d other companies that pose security risks. The Trump administration claims TikTok and other Chinese software companies pose risks because the could send private user data to the Chinese government. Critics say banning the up-and-coming TikTok would benefit companies such as Facebook Inc. FB, +0.26% and Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL, +1.82% GOOG, +1.97% Google \u2014 which are already under government antitrust scrutiny \u2014 by removing a key competitor."}]}
