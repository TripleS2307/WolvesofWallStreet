The Democratic presidential candidate was speaking to reporters in Maryland about the second debate, which is scheduled to be held on Oct. 15 in Miami, Florida. \u201cWell, I think if he still has COVID, we shouldn\u2019t have a debate,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI think we were gonna have to follow very strict guidelines. Too many people have been infected. It\u2019s a very serious problem, so I will be guided by the guidelines.\u201d The statement from the former vice president comes as more than a dozen people who work in the West Wing, including President Trump, have contracted the virus. Trump returned to the White House on Monday night after spending four days at Walter Reed Medical Center to be treated for the virus. \u201cNow I\u2019m better and maybe I\u2019m immune, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Trump said upon his return to the White House."}]}
