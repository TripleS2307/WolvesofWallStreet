Odwalla is one of the biggest brands Coke KO, +0.69% has eliminated. The move will cut about 300 jobs, a company spokeswoman said. Coke will stop delivering Odwalla to stores by the end of July and will pick up unsold inventory through August, she said. After several years of assessment on Odwalla\u2019s performance, \u201cwe couldn\u2019t make it work, we couldn\u2019t figure out the cost-effectiveness of it,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cIt really is the result of consumers changing what they want so rapidly. By freeing up those assets, we can reinvest those costs in what consumers want today.\u201d Coke\u2019s chilled delivery network includes about 230 trucks, all of which will be sold, the spokeswoman said. Those trucks also carry Simply orange juice and single-serve Fairlife milk. The company will find other routes to market for those products, she said.
