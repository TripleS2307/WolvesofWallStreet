Gold has risen above $2,000 for the first time since the prediction. Gold, in addition to being an investment by itself and a substitute for fiat currencies, should also be considered by stock market investors as insurance. Let\u2019s explore the issue. If you review gold ETF GLD, +1.81% you\u2019ll note the following: \u2022 From a technical perspective, gold has broken out after a long base, which is considered bullish. \u2022 RSI (relative strength index) has traced a very bullish pattern. \u2022 I have received quite a bit of hate mail from stock market investors who do not believe in gold and consider it a worthless yellow piece of metal. Many quote Warren Buffett\u2019s dislike for gold. \u2022 In many ways, this call on gold is similar to the call I made on the stock market. When the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% was in the 16,000-point range, my call was for the Dow to reach 30,000. Please see \u201cHere\u2019s the case for Dow 30,000 in Trump\u2019s first term.\u201d \u2022 I do have a track record with gold. I made a call on gold when it was in the $600 range. \u2022 Gold is not going to go up to $3,000 in a straight line. Gold is very overbought in the short term. When a commodity gets overbought, it is vulnerable to a pullback. Insurance Even stock market bulls who normally do not invest in gold may consider buying it on a pullback as insurance for their stock market portfolios. Here are a few scenarios to consider: \u2022 The present policies of money printing by the Federal Reserve and massive borrowing by the government may debase the U.S. dollar. Gold is priced in U.S. dollars. As the dollar weakens, initially both the stock market and gold will benefit. In the longer term, gold will continue to benefit from a weaker dollar, but the U.S. stock market may be hurt. \u2022 If the economy worsens, real interest rates may go lower. This will benefit gold at a time when the stock market may go lower. \u2022 Gold works in both deflationary and inflationary environments. If the stock market goes lower because of deflation, gold may act as good insurance. \u2022 If inflation heats up, in the long run the stock market may fall but gold may benefit. \u2022 The stock market is in a bubble. The Arora Report\u2019s call has been that the bubble will get bigger. If at some point the stock market bubble bursts, gold will benefit. \u2022 If the stock market falls due to a geopolitical event, a rush to safety will benefit gold.Caution There are some scenarios in which gold as an insurance for the stock market will not work and gold as an investment may also not work. Investors can easily experience large losses in gold. Here are five scenarios: \u2022 If interest rates rise, gold may fall. \u2022 If the dollar rises, gold may fall. \u2022 Gold is often sold at times of distress in the stock market as investors sell anything they can to meet margin calls. \u2022 Central banks hold large amounts of gold. It is conceivable that central banks may start selling their gold. \u2022 Gold is a very small market and it can be easily manipulated by the governments. For the foregoing reasons, it is important to properly do the following: \u2022 Portfolio structure. \u2022 Allocation to gold. \u2022 Changes to the portfolio with market conditions. \u2022 Scaling into gold. \u2022 Risk controls.
