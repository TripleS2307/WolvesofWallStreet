And rivals Lowe\u2019s Cos. LOW, +1.38% and Home Depot Inc. HD, +0.49% have been hot as more consumers tackle home projects. \u201cWe keep a sell [stock rating] on the view that August quarter\u2019s beats are reflective of low-hanging fruit from unprecedented stimulus and tailwinds from COVID-19 cocooning (which has temporarily shifted wallet share to home) and make Bed Bath & Beyond\u2019s transformation appear more robust than reality,\u201d wrote Camilla Yanushevsky for CFRA. \u201cRecent efforts to improve fulfillment (e.g. Shipt; Instacart) are commendable, but the company still lacks distinctive positioning.\u201d CFRA\u2019s price target on Bed Bath & Beyond was moved to $8 from $3.
